Taking Care of Yourself


Planning for the Caregiver  Questions to Ask about Advanced Cancer  Research   Taking Care of Yourself  Planning for the Caregiver  Sometimes, as the disease progresses, changes take place in the person with cancer. These may be due to the side effects of treatment or the cancer itself. Or they may be caused by other drugs. Some caregivers have said that they wished they had known sooner about what changes to expect. Changes may occur in: looks  personality or mood  memory  sleep  appetite or nutrition needs  The person you're caring for may or may not go through any of these changes. But you should ask the doctor whether you need to be aware of them and what you can do about them if they happen. No one told us what these pills would do. My partner started to have mood swings and get really angry at me for no reason. Her nurse told me later that this was common when taking these drugs, but how was I supposed to know that? Ashley After deciding on choices for care, sometimes questions arise about whether the person with advanced cancer should live at home or be moved to a nursing or assisted living facility. When making these decisions, here are a few good questions to ask: What kind of help does your loved one need?  If you’re the spouse or other person living with them, are you capable of taking care of them?  If they live alone, is it risky for them to keep doing so?  What are the options for home care?  How often will they need help?  You’ll also need to consider how your loved one feels. They may fear: losing their independence  being seen as weak or a burden to others  moving to a health care or other type of assisted living facility  Sometimes it's easier to consider a change in living arrangements when the advice comes from a health professional. Social workers, including visiting nurses, those who work with older adults, and others may be able to help you talk to your loved one about these decisions. What do you say to someone with terminal cancer? Whether it’s a spouse, family member, or friend, talking about serious issues is never easy. It’s normal to not know what to say to someone with end-stage cancer, or to worry that you’ll say the wrong thing. But the most important thing is not what you say, but that you're showing you care. This section offers advice on how to talk about terminal cancer. Your loved one with cancer may want to go to our patient section, Talking about Your Advanced Cancer, for tips as well. It’s likely that you and your loved one with cancer are both having the same thoughts and fears about the end of life. There will come a time when you will need to talk about these issues together. These might include: the stage of the cancer  preparing for the future  fears about death  wishes at the end of life  Some families talk openly about these sorts of things, while others don’t. There's no right or wrong way to connect. But studies show that families who talk things out feel better about the care they get and the decisions they make. A few things to remember are: You and your loved one can still have hope for comfort, peace, and acceptance. It's a good idea to talk about the fact that the future is uncertain. Avoiding important issues only makes them harder to deal with later. Talking over your concerns can bring comfort to all involved.  Keeping the truth from each other isn’t helpful. It's important to get any thoughts or concerns you both have out in the open. You may find that you both are thinking the same things. Or you may find you’re thinking very different things.  Often the best way to communicate with someone is to just listen. This is one of the main ways of showing that you’re there for them. It’s important to be supportive of whatever your loved one wants to say. It’s their life and their cancer. They need to process thoughts and fears in their own time and their own way.  Bringing up issues related to terminal cancer can be tough. You may think, for example, that your loved one needs to try a different treatment or see a different doctor. Or they may be worried about losing independence, being seen as weak, or being a burden to you. What's important to remember is that your loved one has the right to choose how to live the rest of their life. Although you may have strong opinions about what they should do, the decision is theirs to make. Below are some tips on how to bring up hard topics. Practice what you’ll say in advance.  Find a quiet time. Ask if it’s an okay time to talk.  Know what your goals are having this talk. What do you want as the result?  Speak from your heart.  Allow time for your loved one to talk. Listen and try not to interrupt.  You don’t always have to say, “It’ll be okay.”  Some people won’t start a conversation themselves, but may respond if you start first. But if you have trouble talking about painful issues, ask for professional advice. A counselor or other mental health expert may be able to help you and your loved one explore topics that you don’t feel able to on your own. And if they don't want to go to the counselor with you, you can always go alone. You may hear some ideas for how to bring up these topics. You can also talk about other concerns and feelings that you're dealing with right now. Instead of: Dad, you are going to be just fine.Try: Dad, are there some things that worry you? Instead of: Don’t talk like that! You can beat this!Try: It must be hard to come to terms with all of this. Instead of: I can’t see how anyone can help anymore.Try: We will be there for you always. Instead of: What do the doctors know? You might live forever.Try: Do you think the doctors are right? How does it seem to you? Instead of: Please don’t give up. I need you here.Try: I will miss you terribly. But we will get through somehow. Instead of: There has to be something more to try.Try: Let’s be sure to get the best of medical treatments, but we will be together when we have done all we can. Instead of: Don’t be glum. You’ll get well.Try: It must be hard. Can I just sit with you for a while? From J. Lynn, J. Harrold, and J.L. Schuster. Handbook for Mortals: Guidance for People Facing Serious Illness. Oxford University Press: New York, NY. 2011. Reprinted with permission. A terminal cancer diagnosis brings up a number of decisions to make. These may be about what type of care or treatment to receive. Or they may be about the kind of information patients and loved ones want to hear. Or deciding where to continue getting care. For many families, it's important that the person with cancer be in charge of making decisions. Yet in some families and also in some cultures, it's common for family caregivers to make most of the decisions. And they may make them with or without the patient knowing. Or, sometimes the patient wants the caregiver to make all the decisions. Making these decisions may be hard on you for a number of reasons including: Your own desires for your loved one’s care may make it hard to decide what is best for them.  Your ideas about how to move forward may differ from those of other family members and friends.  The person with cancer may have different beliefs about care than you or other loved ones.  The opinions of your health care team may differ from the patient’s or yours.  If you and your loved one with advanced cancer have different thoughts about next steps for care, you should talk about your opinions with each other. However, in the end, it's their choice. If you can't agree, you may want to ask someone else to guide the conversation between you both. You might talk to a member of your faith community, a social worker, other people dealing with cancer, or a hospice worker. There may also come a time when you have to make medical decisions for your loved one because they can't anymore. It's important to get a sense of how they feel about certain issues while they can still tell you. For example, who would they like to be in charge of their medical decisions? Have they signed advance directives to express what kind of care they want to receive? Knowing what your loved one wants may mean letting go of some of your own opinions. For example, you may want to keep them alive, whatever it takes. But they may wish to stop receiving life-sustaining measures at a certain point. Try to keep things in perspective by looking at how the disease has advanced. Listen to the doctors and others who are giving care. Get the facts about the care you wish your loved one would get versus what is being given. If advance directives can’t be found and your loved one can’t speak for themselves, you may feel anxious and stressed as you decide what choices to make for their care. Think about what they would want, or imagine what they would say if they could talk. Try to remember if something was said in the past that would help you decide. Know that it’s common for family members to disagree on what kind of care to give your loved one. If this is the case for you, ask a member of your health care team to hold a family meeting and lead a discussion. They can explain the goals of the medical care being offered. For example, are they to: Slow the cancer?  Lessen pain and other symptoms?  Prolong life?  Talking about these issues can help answer remaining questions. Having this talk with everyone present may lessen the conflicts and help the family reach a decision for your loved one. Children of all ages may wonder about dying, life after death, and what happens to the body. It's important to answer all their questions. If not, they may imagine things or make up their own stories. Let them know that everything is being done to keep their loved one comfortable. Tell them that you will keep them updated. (For much more detailed advice on talking to children and others about advanced cancer, see our Talking to Others about Advanced Cancer section.) Tell the truth. Children deserve to be told the truth about a poor prognosis. Hiding the truth from them leaves them unprepared for their loved one's death and can prolong the grief they will feel. And if you don't talk about your loved one's condition or don't tell the truth about it, your children may have a hard time trusting others in the future. By including children in the family crisis, you can guide them toward healthy ways of coping with what is happening. You can help them prepare for their impending loss in healing ways, such as providing opportunities for them to say goodbye. Know your own views. To answer tough questions from your kids about the potential death of your loved one, you need to know your own views on the subjects, including: What are you hoping for?  What do you think will happen?  You can show children how to hope for the best while accepting the likely outcome of death. If you're honest and up front, you're teaching them that death is a natural part of life. Your honesty shows them it’s okay to talk about death. You can also tell them that they won't be alone in their time of need. You will always be there for them. Counselors and oncology social workers can also suggest ways to talk to kids about death in ways they understand. They may know of local or national programs that offer help to children in these situations. Or they may suggest books, videos, and websites that explore these topics. If your children don't live with the person who has terminal cancer, it's helpful to prepare them before they visit. The decision of whether or not to let them visit is up to you, the person with cancer, and perhaps other family members. However, children should also have a choice about whether or not they want to visit. If your loved one is in a hospital or other facility, explain what the area and the room will look like. Tell them who might be there and what they might see. Also explain gently if their loved one’s physical condition or personality has changed. For a younger child, you might say something like this: "Grandma is very sick. When you see her, she will be in bed. She may not have a lot of energy to play with you or talk to you as much. She may look a little different too."  "Mom may be sleeping while you're there. Or she may be awake but won't talk because she's resting. But she'll know and be happy that you're there. She loves you!"  "Don't worry if you're visiting Uncle Bill and he says things that don't make sense. Sometimes the medicine he takes makes him do that. If it happens, we can tell his doctor about it to make sure he's okay."  Sometimes children don't want to visit, or can't for other reasons. In that case, there are other ways of showing they care. They can write a letter or do artwork. They can call the patient or leave messages or songs in their voicemail. Encourage them to show love and support in any way they choose.

DCB Investigators   Advances in Cancer Biology Research  Milestones Timeline  DCB Investigators  Dr. Anirban Maitra is a Professor of Pathology and Translational Molecular Pathology at MD Anderson Cancer Center. His research focuses on the early detection and treatment of pancreatic cancer. Originally studying pediatric pathology, Dr. Maitra’s career trajectory changed upon attending a seminar on pancreatic cancer, which motivated him to address knowledge gaps in the disease’s biology. He wanted to explore the molecular and clinical aspects of the disease for the sake of improving patient prognosis. “This is a disease where there’s an opportunity to make a huge difference,” said Dr. Maitra. Later, Dr. Maitra’s lab developed a pancreatic cancer liquid biopsy method, which is a non-invasive blood test that detects the presence of tumors. “There’s still a long way to go, but now we know what to look for and who to look in,” said Dr. Maitra regarding the future direction of pancreatic cancer detection. Additionally, Dr. Maitra, explained that since pancreatic cancer is nonresponsive to many existing therapies, knowledge of its biology and resistance mechanisms has been critical to the design of clinical studies. “The trials that are starting to show signals all have strong basic science behind them,” said Dr. Maitra. To him, understanding the biological basis for how and why a treatment is working is as important as developing the therapy itself. Dr. Maitra’s research, at its core, is translational. In his words, the progression of pancreatic cancer research is, “a circular path.” Advancements made in the laboratory influence the development of clinical trials, and trial results ultimately inform the direction of lab research. Discoveries in pancreatic cancer have broader implications and can help identify, “[biological] pathways common across major tumor types.” During his career, Dr. Maitra has collaborated with researchers across the world. “I’m lucky to be a part of teams that have done many important things,” he stated, regarding contributions made to the field over the past twenty years. Currently, Dr. Maitra is a part of the Translational and Basic Science Research in Early Lesions (TBEL) program and the Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Stromal Reprogramming Consortium (PSRC), two collaborative efforts between investigators of different research specialties. According to Dr. Maitra, “The greatest chance of success is when we pool our resources together.” Outside the lab, communication between investigators and the public is another component of Dr. Maitra’s work. He uses social media to share news on current pancreatic cancer research with the broad community. He thinks that science communication allows “patients to feel empowered” and fosters a community of trust essential to long-term cancer research. Dr. Maitra encourages experts to share their knowledge and voices, “Because if you don’t, then someone else is going to fill that vacuum.”  Posted:

What factors increase the risk of melanoma? How can people protect their skin from the sun? What is a common mole? A common mole is a growth on the skin that develops when pigment cells (melanocytes) grow in clusters. Most adults have between 10 and 40 common moles. These growths are usually found above the waist on areas exposed to the sun. They are seldom found on the scalp, breast, or buttocks. Although common moles may be present at birth, they usually appear later in childhood. Most people continue to develop new moles until about age 40. In older people, common moles tend to fade away. Another name for a mole is a nevus. The plural is nevi. What does a common mole look like? A common mole is usually smaller than about 5 millimeters wide (about 1/4 inch, the width of a pencil eraser). It is round or oval, has a smooth surface with a distinct edge, and is often dome-shaped. A common mole usually has an even color of pink, tan, or brown. People who have dark skin or hair tend to have darker moles than people with fair skin or blonde hair. Several photos of common moles are shown here, and What Does a Mole Look Like? has more examples. This common mole is 1 millimeter in diameter (the width of the tip of a sharpened pencil). This common mole is 2 millimeters in diameter (the width of the tip of a new crayon). This common mole is about 5 millimeters in diameter (the width of a new pencil eraser). This common mole is about 5 millimeters in diameter (the width of a new pencil eraser). This common mole is about 5 millimeters in diameter (the width of a new pencil eraser). Can a common mole turn into melanoma? Only rarely does a common mole turn into melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. Although common moles are not cancerous, people who have many small moles or several large ones have an increased risk of developing melanoma (1). Certain changes in a mole may indicate that it is turning into a melanoma (2). People should tell their doctor if they notice The color of the mole changes  The mole gets unevenly smaller or bigger (unlike normal moles in children, which get evenly bigger)  The mole changes in shape, texture, or height  The skin on the surface of the mole becomes dry or scaly  The mole becomes hard or feels lumpy  The mole starts to itch  The mole bleeds or oozes  What is a dysplastic nevus? A dysplastic nevus is a type of mole that looks different from a common mole. (Some doctors use the term "atypical mole" to refer to a dysplastic nevus.) A dysplastic nevus may be bigger than a common mole, and its color, surface, and border may be different. It is usually more than 5 millimeters wide (1, 3). A dysplastic nevus can have a mixture of several colors, from pink to dark brown. It is usually flat, with a smooth, slightly scaly, or pebbly surface, and it has an irregular edge that may fade into the surrounding skin. Some examples of dysplastic nevi are shown here. What Does a Mole Look Like? has more examples. This dysplastic nevus has a raised area at the center that doctors may call a “fried egg” appearance. This dysplastic nevus is more than 5 millimeters in diameter. This dysplastic nevus is more than 10 millimeters wide (a little less than 1/2 inch). A dysplastic nevus may occur anywhere on the body, but it is usually seen in areas exposed to the sun, such as on the back. A dysplastic nevus may also appear in areas not exposed to the sun, such as the breasts and areas below the waist (1, 3). Some people have only a couple of dysplastic nevi, but other people have more than 10. People who have dysplastic nevi usually also have an increased number of common moles. Can a dysplastic nevus turn into melanoma? Only rarely does a dysplastic nevus turn into melanoma (1, 3).  However, dysplastic nevi are a risk factor for developing melanoma, and the more dysplastic nevi a person has, the greater their risk of developing melanoma (1, 3). Researchers estimate that the risk of melanoma is about 10 times greater for someone with more than five dysplastic nevi than for someone who has none. What should people do if they have a dysplastic nevus? Everyone should protect their skin from the sun and stay away from sunlamps and tanning booths, but for people who have dysplastic nevi, it is even more important to protect the skin and avoid getting a suntan or sunburn. In addition, many doctors recommend that people with dysplastic nevi check their skin once a month (2, 4). People should tell their doctor if they see any of the following changes in a dysplastic nevus (2): The color changes.  It gets smaller or bigger.  It changes in shape, texture, or height.  The skin on the surface becomes dry or scaly.  It becomes hard or feels lumpy.  It starts to itch.  It bleeds or oozes.  People with dysplastic nevi should have their skin examined by a doctor regularly (2, 4). Sometimes, people or their doctors take photographs of dysplastic nevi so changes over time are easier to see (2). For people with more than five dysplastic nevi, doctors may conduct a skin exam once a year because of the moderately increased risk of melanoma. For people who also have a family history of melanoma, doctors may suggest a more frequent skin exam, such as every 3 to 6 months (3). Should people have a doctor remove a dysplastic nevus or a common mole to prevent it from changing into melanoma? No. Normally, people do not need to have a dysplastic nevus or a common mole removed. One reason is that very few dysplastic nevi or common moles turn into melanoma (1, 3). And most melanomas do not start as common moles or dysplastic nevi (2). That is why doctors usually remove only moles that have changed or new colored or otherwise suspicious areas on the skin. What is melanoma? Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that begins in melanocytes. It is potentially dangerous because it can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body, such as the lung, liver, bone, or brain. The earlier that melanoma is detected and removed, the more likely that treatment will be successful. Most melanocytes are in the skin, and melanoma can occur on any skin surface. It can develop from a common mole or dysplastic nevus, but more often it develops in an area of apparently normal skin. In addition, melanoma can also develop in the eye (called uveal melanoma), under the nail, the digestive tract, and other areas of the body. When melanoma develops in men, it is often found on the head, neck, or back. When melanoma develops in women, it is often found on the back or the lower legs. People with dark skin are much less likely than people with fair skin to develop melanoma. For example, in 2017–2018, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with melanoma was 2.9% (1 in 34) for White people but 0.1% (1 in 1,000) for Black people and 0.5% (1 in 200) for Hispanic people. However, people with dark skin tend to be diagnosed with more advanced melanoma than people with fair skin (5). Advanced melanomas are harder to control and typically have a worse prognosis than melanomas diagnosed at an earlier stage. So it is very important that people with dark skin be aware of the warning signs of melanoma (see What does melanoma look like?). Melanomas in people with dark skin are typically found under the fingernails or toenails (usually initially appearing as a pigmented streak in the nail), on the palms of the hands, or on the soles of the feet. What does melanoma look like? Often the first sign of melanoma is a change in the shape, color, size, or feel of an existing mole. Melanoma may also appear as a new colored or otherwise unusual area on the skin. The "ABCDE" rule describes the features of early melanoma (2, 6): Asymmetry. The shape of one half does not match the other half.  Border that is irregular. The edges are often ragged, notched, or blurred in outline. The pigment may spread into the surrounding skin.  Color that is uneven. Shades of black, brown, and tan may be present. Areas of white, gray, red, pink, or blue may also be seen.  Diameter. There is a change in size, usually an increase. Melanomas can be tiny, but most are larger than 6 millimeters wide (about 1/4 inch wide).  Evolving. The mole has changed over the past few weeks or months.  Melanomas can vary greatly in how they look. Many melanomas show all of the ABCDE features. However, some may show only one or two of the ABCDE features (6). Several photos of melanomas are shown here. More photos are on the What Does Melanoma Look Like? page. In advanced melanoma, the texture of the mole may change. The skin on the surface may break down and look scraped. The mole may become hard or lumpy and the surface may ooze or bleed. Sometimes the melanoma is itchy, tender, or painful. How is melanoma diagnosed? The only way to diagnose melanoma is to remove tissue and check it for cancer cells. The doctor will remove all or part of the skin that looks abnormal. Usually, this procedure takes only a few minutes and can be done in a doctor's office, clinic, or hospital. The sample will be sent to a lab and a pathologist will look at the tissue under a microscope to check for melanoma. What are the differences between a common mole, a dysplastic nevus, and a melanoma? Common moles, dysplastic nevi, and melanoma vary by size, color, shape, and surface texture. The table below summarizes some differences between moles and cancer. Another important difference is that a common mole or dysplastic nevus will not return after it is removed by a full excisional biopsy from the skin, but melanoma sometimes grows back. Also, melanoma is cancer, so it can spread to other parts of the body. Accounts for only about 1% of all skin cancer cases  99,780 new cases of melanoma in the United States expected in 2022 (7)  May be pink, tan, brown, black (in people with dark skin), or a color that is very close to a person’s normal skin tone  The color is usually even throughout.  Usually uneven in color. May have shades of black, brown, and tan.  May also have areas of white, gray, red, pink, or blue  Have irregular or notched edges  May fade into the rest of the skin  Often irregular and asymmetrical (the shape of one half does not match the other half)  Edges may be ragged, notched, or blurred. May fade into the rest of the skin.  Begins as a flat, smooth spot on the skin  May become raised and form a smooth bump  What should people do if a mole changes or if they find a new mole or some other change on their skin? People should tell their doctor if they find a new mole or a change in an existing mole. A family doctor may refer people with an unusual mole or other concerns about their skin to a dermatologist. A dermatologist is a doctor who specializes in diseases of the skin. Also, some plastic surgeons, general surgeons, internists, cancer specialists, and family doctors have special training in moles and melanoma. What factors increase the risk of melanoma? Although anyone can develop melanoma, people with the following risk factors have an increased risk of melanoma: Having a dysplastic nevus  Having many small moles or several large ones  Skin that burns easily: People who have fair (pale) skin that burns easily in the sun, blue or gray eyes, red or blond hair, or many freckles have an increased risk of melanoma.  Sunlight: Sunlight is a source of UV radiation, which causes skin damage that can lead to melanoma and other skin cancers.
	Severe, blistering sunburns: People who have had at least one severe, blistering sunburn have an increased risk of melanoma. Although people who burn easily are more likely to have had sunburns as a child, sunburns during adulthood also increase the risk of melanoma.
Lifetime sun exposure: The greater the total amount of sun exposure over a lifetime, the greater the risk of melanoma.
Tanning: Although having skin that tans well lowers the risk of sunburn, even people who tan well without burning increase their risk of melanoma by spending time in the sun without protection.  Use of sunlamps and tanning booths: UV radiation from artificial sources, such as sunlamps and tanning booths, can cause skin damage and melanoma.  Personal history of melanoma: People who have had melanoma have an increased risk of developing other melanomas.  Family history of unusual moles or melanoma: Melanoma sometimes runs in families. People who have two or more close relatives (mother, father, sister, brother, or child) with melanoma have an increased risk of melanoma. In rare cases, members of a family will have an inherited disorder that greatly increases the risk of melanoma. For example, people with xeroderma pigmentosum, have skin that is extremely sensitive to the sun because of a defect in DNA repair, which greatly increases their risk of melanoma. Another inherited disorder that increases the risk of melanoma is familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome, which is usually caused by inherited mutations in the CDKN2A gene.  Having a weakened immune system or being immunosuppressed: People who have a weakened immune system, including people with inherited disorders of the immune system, recipients of organ transplants (8), and people with lymphoma, have an increased risk of melanoma (9).  Severe, blistering sunburns: People who have had at least one severe, blistering sunburn have an increased risk of melanoma. Although people who burn easily are more likely to have had sunburns as a child, sunburns during adulthood also increase the risk of melanoma.  Lifetime sun exposure: The greater the total amount of sun exposure over a lifetime, the greater the risk of melanoma.  Tanning: Although having skin that tans well lowers the risk of sunburn, even people who tan well without burning increase their risk of melanoma by spending time in the sun without protection.  How can people protect their skin from the sun? People can protect their skin from the sun by following the tips on NCI's Sunlight risk factor page. The best way to prevent melanoma is to limit exposure to sunlight. Having a suntan or sunburn means that the skin has been damaged by the sun, and continued tanning or burning increases the risk of developing melanoma.  Goldstein AM, Tucker MA.

HLA Overview HLA Matching Considerations for Sibling and Related Donors HLA Matching Considerations for Unrelated Donors HLA Matching and Cell Dose Considerations for Unrelated Cord Blood HSCT Haploidentical HSCT Comparison of Stem Cell Products Other Donor Characteristics Associated With Outcome Appropriate matching between donor and recipient HLA in the major histocompatibility complex located on chromosome 6 is essential to successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (see Figure 1, Table 1, and Table 2). EnlargeFigure 1.  HLA Complex. Human chromosome 6 with amplification of the HLA region. The locations of specific HLA loci for the class I B, C, and A alleles and the class II DP, DQ, and DR alleles are shown. HLA class I (A, B, C, etc.) and class II (DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5, DQB1, DPB1, etc.) alleles are highly polymorphic; therefore, finding appropriately matched unrelated donors is a challenge for some patients, especially those of certain racial groups (e.g., patients with African, Hispanic, Asian, or Pacific-Islander ancestry).[1,2] Full siblings of cancer patients have a 25% chance of being HLA matched. Early serologic techniques of HLA assessment defined a number of HLA antigens, but more precise DNA methodologies have shown HLA allele-level mismatches in up to 40% of serologic HLA antigen matches. These differences are clinically relevant because the use of donors with allele-level mismatches affects survival and rates of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) to a degree similar to that in patients with antigen-level mismatches.[3]  Because of this, DNA-based allele-level HLA typing is standard when unrelated donors are being chosen. The National Marrow Donor Program has published guidelines for HLA matching.  The term for allele-level matching used in their     guidelines is antigen recognition domain, which refers to the fact that the allele-level similarities used to define the specific HLA type are associated with areas directly used for antigen recognition.  Polymorphisms of the HLA proteins outside of these areas are not involved in the function of these molecules; therefore, they are often not assessed as part of HLA testing and unlikely to contribute to HLA mismatch.[4] The most commonly used related donor is a sibling from the same parents who, at a minimum, is HLA matched for HLA A, HLA B, and HLA DRB1 at the antigen level.  Given the distance between HLA A and HLA DRB1 on chromosome 6, there is approximately a 1% possibility of a crossover event occurring in a possible sibling match.  Because a crossover event could involve the HLA C antigen and because parents may share HLA antigens that actually differ at the allele level, many centers perform allele-level typing of possible sibling donors at all of the key HLA antigens (HLA A, B, C, and DRB1).  Any related donor that is not a full sibling should have full HLA typing because similar haplotypes from different parents could differ at the allele level. Although single-antigen mismatched related donors (5/6 antigen matched) were used interchangeably with matched sibling donors in some studies, a large Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) study in pediatric HSCT recipients showed that the use of 5/6 antigen-matched related donors resulted in rates of GVHD and overall survival (OS) equivalent to rates in 8/8-allele-level-matched unrelated donors and slightly inferior survival than in fully matched siblings.[6] Any siblings with single mismatches should have extended typing to ensure that if the mismatch is caused by a crossover, it only occurs with one antigen. If clinicians choose siblings with multiple antigen mismatches as donors, haploidentical approaches may be warranted. Optimal outcomes are achieved in unrelated allogeneic bone marrow transplant when the pairs of antigens at HLA A, B, C, and DRB1 are matched between the donor and the recipient at the allele level (termed an 8/8 match) (see Table 2).[7]  A single antigen/allele mismatch at any of these antigens (7/8 match) lowers the probability of survival between 5% and 10%, with a similar increase in the amount of significant (grades III–IV) acute GVHD.[7]  Of these four antigen pairs, different reports have shown HLA A, C, and DRB1 mismatches to potentially be more highly associated with mortality than the other antigens,[3,7,8] but the differences in outcome are small and inconsistent, making it very difficult to conclude that one can pick a more favorable mismatch by choosing one type of antigen mismatch over another.  Many study groups are attempting to define specific antigens or pairs of antigens that are associated with either good or poor outcomes.  For example, a specific HLA C mismatch (HLA-C*03:03/03:04) has outcomes similar to a match; therefore, selection of this mismatch is desirable in an otherwise matched donor/pair combination.[9] It is well understood that class II antigen DRB1 mismatches increase GVHD incidence and worsen survival.[8] Subsequent data have also shown that multiple mismatches of DQB1, DPB1, and DRB3,4,5 lead to worse outcomes in the setting of less than 8/8 matches.[10]  DPB1 mismatches have been extensively studied and classified as permissive or nonpermissive on the basis of T-cell epitope matching.  Patients with 10/10 matches and nonpermissive DPB1 mismatches have more transplant-related mortality but have survival rates similar to those with DPB1 matches or permissive matches.  Those with 9/10 matches who have nonpermissive DPB1 mismatches had worse survival than did those with permissive mismatches or DPB1 matches.[11-13] With these findings in mind, although a 7/8- or 8/8-matched unrelated donor can be used routinely, outcomes may be further improved with the following: Extended typing of DQB1, DPB1, and DRB3,4,5.[4,11-13] Extended HLA testing to select appropriate donors in the context of HLA-sensitized patients to avoid the potential risk of graft failure.[14,15]  HLA sensitization is detected by testing for the presence of specific anti-HLA antibodies and avoiding donors who have any HLA antigens associated with the antibodies present in the recipient. Use of younger donors.[5] Matching cytomegalovirus (CMV)-positive recipients with CMV-positive donors and matching CMV-negative recipients with CMV-negative donors.[16] Use of blood type–compatible unrelated donors.[5] EnlargeFigure 2.  HLA allele duplication in a donor or recipient results in a half match and a mismatch that will either occur in a direction that promotes GVHD (GVH-O) or a direction that promotes rejection (R-O). If a donor or recipient has a duplication of one of their HLA alleles, they will have a half match and a mismatch only in one direction.  Figure 2 illustrates that these mismatches will occur in either a direction that promotes GVHD (GVH-O) or a direction that promotes rejection (R-O). When 8/8-matched unrelated donors are compared with 7/8 donors mismatched in the GVH-O direction, 7/8 mismatched in the R-O direction, or 7/8 mismatched in both directions, the mismatch in the R-O direction leads to rates of grades III and IV acute GVHD similar to rates in the 8/8 matched and better than in the other two combinations. The 7/8 mismatched in only the R-O direction is preferred over GVH-O and bidirectional mismatches.[17]  It is important to note that this observation in unrelated donors differs from observations in cord blood recipients, outlined below. Another commonly used hematopoietic stem cell source is unrelated umbilical cord blood, which is harvested from donor placentas moments after birth. The cord blood is processed, HLA typed, cryopreserved, and banked. Unrelated cord blood transplant has been successful with less-stringent HLA matching requirements compared with standard related or unrelated donors, probably because of limited antigen exposure experienced in utero and different immunological composition.  Cord blood matching has traditionally been performed at an intermediate level for HLA A and B and at an allele level (high resolution) for DRB1.  This means that until just recently, attempted matching of only six antigens has been used to choose units for transplant. Although better outcomes occur when 6/6 or 5/6 HLA-matched units are used,[18] successful HSCT has occurred even with 4/6 or less HLA-matched units in many patients. In a large CIBMTR/Eurocord study, better matching at the allele level using eight antigens (matching for HLA A, B, C, and DRB1) resulted in less transplant-related mortality and improved survival.  Best outcome was noted with 8/8 allele matching versus 4/8 to 7/8 matches, with poor survival in patients with five or more allele mismatches.  Patients receiving 8/8-matched cord blood did not require higher cell doses for better outcomes; however, those with one to three allele mismatches had less transplant-related mortality with total nucleated cell counts  higher than 3 × 107/kg, and those with four allele mismatches required a total nucleated cell count  higher than 5 × 107/kg to decrease transplant-related mortality.[19] This observation was noted to be especially important in cord blood transplant for nonmalignant disorders, where any mismatching below 7/8 alleles led to inferior survival.[20] Many centers will type additional alleles and use the best match possible, but the impact of DQB1, DPB1, and DRB3,4,5  mismatches has not been studied in detail. As in unrelated peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) or bone marrow donors, extended HLA testing can support the selection of appropriate cord blood units in HLA-sensitized patients to avoid the potential risk of graft failure.[21,22] Evidence also suggests that selecting a mismatched cord blood unit, where the mismatch involves a noninherited maternal antigen, may improve survival.[23,24] As with unrelated donors, individuals can occasionally have duplicate HLA antigens  (e.g., the HLA A antigen is 01 on both chromosomes).  When this occurs in a donor product and the antigen is matched to one of the recipient antigens, the recipient immune response will see the donor antigens as matched (matched, in the rejection direction), but the donor immune response will see a mismatch in the recipient (mismatched in the GVHD direction).  This variation of partial mismatching has been shown to be important in cord blood transplant outcomes.  Mismatches that are only in the GVHD direction (i.e., GVH-O) lead to lower transplant-related mortality and overall mortality than those with rejection direction only (i.e., R-O) mismatches.[25] R-O mismatches have outcomes similar to those of  bidirectional mismatches.[26] Although these studies suggest that using unidirectional mismatching as a criteria for cord blood selection may be beneficial, a Eurocord–European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation analysis disputes the value of this type of mismatching.[27] Two aspects of umbilical cord blood HSCT have made the practice more widely applicable.  First, because a successful procedure can occur with multiple HLA mismatches, more than 95% of patients from a wide variety of ethnicities are able to find at least a 4/6-matched cord blood unit.[1,28]  Second, as mentioned above, adequate cell dose (minimum 2–3 × 107 total nucleated cells/kg and 1.7 × 105 CD34+ cells/kg) has been shown to be associated with improved survival.[29,30]  Total nucleated cells are generally used to judge units because techniques to measure CD34-positive doses have not been standardized.  Because even large single umbilical cord blood units are only able to supply these minimum doses to recipients weighing up to 40 kg to 50 kg, early umbilical cord blood HSCT focused mainly on smaller children.  Later studies showed that barriers of this size could be overcome by using two umbilical cord blood units if each of the units is at least a 4/6 HLA match with the recipient. Because two cord blood units provide higher cell doses, umbilical cord blood transplant is now used widely for larger children and adults.[31] If a single unit provides an adequate cell dose, there may be disadvantages to adding a second unit.[32][Level of evidence A1]  Two randomized trials showed that in children who had adequately sized single units, the addition of a second unit did not alter relapse, transplant-related mortality, or survival rates, but was associated with higher rates of extensive chronic GVHD.[32,33] Investigators have shown that by using combinations of cytokines and other compounds to expand cord blood for a period of time before infusion, engraftment of cord blood cells can occur more rapidly than after standard approaches.[34-37]  Although some studies that used multiple units or split units showed that expanded units will engraft early and then give way to nonexpanded units for long-term reconstitution,[38] other studies are showing persistence of expanded cells, implying preservation of stem cells through the expansion process.[36,37]  A number of these approaches are under investigation. Their effect on efficacy and survival of children using cord blood as a stem cell source has yet to be established, and none are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Early HSCT studies demonstrated progressively higher percentages of patients experiencing severe GVHD and lower survival rates as the number of donor/recipient HLA mismatches increased.[39]  Other studies showed that even with very high numbers of donors in unrelated-donor registries, patients with rare HLA haplotypes and patients with certain ethnic backgrounds (e.g., patients with African, Hispanic, Asian, or Pacific-Islander ancestry) have a low chance of achieving desired levels of HLA matching (7/8 or 8/8 match at the allele level).[2] To allow access to HSCT for patients without fully HLA-matched donor options, investigators have developed techniques allowing the use of siblings, parents, or other relatives who share only a single haplotype of the HLA complex with the patient and are thus half matches.  Most approaches developed to date rely on intense T-cell depletion of the product before infusion into the patient. The main challenge associated with this approach is intense immune suppression with delayed immune recovery, which can result in lethal infections,[40] increased risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–associated lymphoproliferative disorder, and high rates of relapse.[41]  This led to inferior survival compared with matched-donor HSCTs in the past and resulted in the procedure being used mainly at larger academic centers with a specific research focus on studying and developing this approach. Current approaches, however, are rapidly evolving, resulting in improved outcomes, with some pediatric groups reporting survival similar to that of standard approaches.[42-45]  These approaches include the following: Newer techniques of T-cell depletion and add-back of specific cell populations (e.g., CD3 or alpha-beta CD3/CD19-negative selection) have decreased transplant-related mortality.[46]; [44,45,47,48][Level of evidence C2] Reduced toxicity regimens have led to improved survival. Better supportive care has decreased the chance of morbidity from infection or EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder.[49] Some patient-donor combinations that have specific killer immunoglobulin-like receptor mismatches have shown decreased likelihood of relapse. For more information, see the Role of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) mismatching in HSCT section. Certain techniques, such as using combinations of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor–primed bone marrow and PBSCs with posttransplant antibody–based T-cell depletion [50] or post-HSCT cyclophosphamide (chemotherapeutic T-cell depletion),[44,45,51]; [52][Level of evidence C1] have made these procedures more accessible because they do not use the expensive and complicated processing necessary for traditional T-cell depletion. Reported rates of survival using many different types of haploidentical approaches range from 25% to 80%, depending on the technique and the risk of the patient undergoing the procedure.[41,42,50,51]; [52][Level of evidence C1]  Retrospective trials in adults have shown similar outcomes after haploidentical-donor transplants compared with matched-unrelated donor or cord blood transplants.[53,54] One prospective randomized trial in adults with hematologic malignancies that used reduced-intensity regimens showed similar progression-free survival, but lower relapse rates and better OS using haploidentical donors.[55] Pediatric trials using haploidentical donors have shown better outcomes with myeloablative preparative regimens, and survival is comparable to nonhaploidentical approaches.[44,45,48,56] One prospective trial in pediatric patients showed that disease-free survival (DFS) was superior using haploidentical approaches than mismatched unrelated-donor HSCT.  DFS rates in patients treated with haploidentical approaches were similar to those in patients treated with other stem cell sources.[44] Even more than with other stem cell sources, patients undergoing haploidentical procedures can develop anti-HLA antibodies that, if directed against nonshared haploidentical antigens, can greatly increase the risk of rejection.  Clinicians should choose donors with HLA types against whom the recipient does not have an antibody present, if possible.  Guidelines on how to best approach this issue have been published.[57] Currently, the following three stem cell products are used from both related and unrelated donors: Bone marrow. PBSCs. Cord blood. Bone marrow or PBSCs, including partially HLA-matched (half or more antigens [haploidentical]) related bone marrow or PBSCs, can be used after in vitro or in vivo T-cell depletion, and these products behave differently from other stem cell products.  A comparison of stem cell products is presented in Table 3. The main differences between the products are the numbers of T cells and CD34-positive progenitor cells present; very high levels of T cells are present in PBSCs, intermediate numbers in bone marrow, and low numbers in cord blood and T-cell–depleted products.  Patients receiving T-cell–depleted products or cord blood generally have slower hematopoietic recovery, increased risk of infection, late immune reconstitution, higher risks of nonengraftment, and increased risk of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder.  This is countered by lower rates of GVHD and an ability to offer transplant to patients for whom full HLA matching is not available.  Higher doses of T cells and other cells in PBSCs result in rapid neutrophil recovery and immune reconstitution but also increase rates of chronic GVHD. Only a few studies have directly compared outcomes of different stem cell sources/products in pediatric patients. Evidence (comparison of outcomes of stem cell sources/products in children): A retrospective registry study of pediatric patients who underwent HSCT for acute leukemia compared those who received related-donor bone marrow with those who received related-donor PBSCs.[61]  Although the bone marrow and PBSC recipient cohorts differed some in their risk profiles, after statistical correction, increased risk of GVHD and transplant-related mortality associated with PBSCs led to poorer survival in the PBSC group. A retrospective study of Japanese children with acute leukemia compared 90 children who received PBSCs with 571 children who received bone marrow.[62]The study confirmed higher transplant-related mortality caused by GVHD and inferior survival among the children who received PBSCs. A large Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network trial for patients requiring unrelated donors included a number of pediatric patients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either bone marrow or PBSCs. This trial demonstrated the following:[63] OS was identical using either source, but rates of chronic GVHD were significantly higher in the PBSC arm, with a small increase in rejection in the bone marrow arm.Rejections were rare in pediatric patients. There was an insufficient number of patients to draw specific conclusions about rejection risk in children who received bone marrow. Although the bone marrow and PBSC recipient cohorts differed some in their risk profiles, after statistical correction, increased risk of GVHD and transplant-related mortality associated with PBSCs led to poorer survival in the PBSC group. The study confirmed higher transplant-related mortality caused by GVHD and inferior survival among the children who received PBSCs. OS was identical using either source, but rates of chronic GVHD were significantly higher in the PBSC arm, with a small increase in rejection in the bone marrow arm. Rejections were rare in pediatric patients. There was an insufficient number of patients to draw specific conclusions about rejection risk in children who received bone marrow. These reports, combined with a lack of prospective studies comparing bone marrow and PBSCs, have led most pediatric transplant protocols to prefer bone marrow over PBSCs from related donors.  This approach is further supported by a meta-analysis that included additional retrospective trials.[64] Published studies comparing unrelated cord blood and bone marrow have been retrospective, with weaknesses inherent in such analyses. Evidence (comparison of unrelated cord blood versus bone marrow outcomes): In one study, pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent HSCT and received 8/8-HLA-allele–matched unrelated-donor bone marrow were compared with those who received unrelated cord blood.[18]  The analysis showed that the best survival occurred in recipients of 6/6 HLA-matched cord blood; survival after 8/8 HLA-matched unrelated bone marrow was slightly less and was statistically identical to survival for patients receiving 5/6 and 4/6 HLA-matched cord blood units. In another study from a single center consisting of mostly adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and ALL, outcomes for cord blood recipients were compared with outcomes for recipients of matched and mismatched unrelated-donor bone marrow/PBSCs.[65]Better survival because of less relapse was noted in cord blood recipients; this mainly resulted from superior survival in patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) present just before transplant.No difference was seen in relapse and survival between patients with pre-HSCT MRD and patients without pre-HSCT MRD if they received cord blood.These results are controversial because they contradict many other studies that showed that the presence of pre-HSCT MRD in cord blood recipients led to increased relapse and inferior survival rates.[66-69] The CIBMTR compared outcomes of children with low-risk and intermediate-risk ALL and AML who underwent transplant between 2000 and 2014 using alternative donors (non–HLA-matched related or unrelated), including 7/8 HLA-matched bone marrow (n = 172) and 4/6 or greater HLA-matched umbilical cord blood (n = 1,613).[70]In multivariate analysis, patients who received 7/8 HLA-matched bone marrow versus umbilical cord blood had similar GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87–1.45; P = .39), chronic GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.82–1.38; P = .66), and OS (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.80–1.44; P = .66).Relapse may have been higher in the 7/8 HLA-matched bone marrow group (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03–2.02; P = .03; the publication called this a trend as they chose a cutoff value of 0.01% to control for multiple comparisons).The patients in the 7/8 HLA-matched bone marrow group had a significantly higher risk of grades III to IV acute GVHD (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.16–2.48; P = .006) and chronic GVHD (HR, 6.17; 95% CI, 2.2–17.33; P = .0006) than did the patients in the umbilical cord blood group. The analysis showed that the best survival occurred in recipients of 6/6 HLA-matched cord blood; survival after 8/8 HLA-matched unrelated bone marrow was slightly less and was statistically identical to survival for patients receiving 5/6 and 4/6 HLA-matched cord blood units. Better survival because of less relapse was noted in cord blood recipients; this mainly resulted from superior survival in patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) present just before transplant. No difference was seen in relapse and survival between patients with pre-HSCT MRD and patients without pre-HSCT MRD if they received cord blood. These results are controversial because they contradict many other studies that showed that the presence of pre-HSCT MRD in cord blood recipients led to increased relapse and inferior survival rates.[66-69] In multivariate analysis, patients who received 7/8 HLA-matched bone marrow versus umbilical cord blood had similar GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87–1.45; P = .39), chronic GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.82–1.38; P = .66), and OS (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.80–1.44; P = .66). Relapse may have been higher in the 7/8 HLA-matched bone marrow group (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03–2.02; P = .03; the publication called this a trend as they chose a cutoff value of 0.01% to control for multiple comparisons). The patients in the 7/8 HLA-matched bone marrow group had a significantly higher risk of grades III to IV acute GVHD (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.16–2.48; P = .006) and chronic GVHD (HR, 6.17; 95% CI, 2.2–17.33; P = .0006) than did the patients in the umbilical cord blood group. On the basis of these studies, most transplant centers consider matched sibling bone marrow to be the preferred stem cell source/product.  If a sibling donor is not available, fully matched unrelated-donor bone marrow or PBSCs, HLA-matched (4/6 to 6/6 or 6/8 to 8/8) cord blood from a single unit with an adequate cell dose, or a haploidentical HSCT lead to similar survival rates.[48][Level of evidence C2]  Although adult studies of T-cell–depleted unrelated bone marrow or PBSCs have shown outcomes similar to non–T-cell–depleted approaches, large pediatric trials or retrospective studies comparing T-cell–depleted matched or haploidentical bone marrow or PBSCs have not been conducted. HLA matching has consistently been the most important factor associated with improved survival in allogeneic HSCT, but a number of other donor characteristics have been shown to affect key outcomes.  Higher cell dose from the donor has also been shown to be important when related, unrelated, or haploidentical bone marrow or PBSC donors are used.[71,72]  For more information, see the HLA Matching and Cell Dose Considerations for Unrelated Cord Blood HSCT section. The effects of donor age, blood type, CMV status, sex, and parity of female donors have also been studied. Ideally, after HLA matching, transplant centers should select donors based on the following characteristics: Donor age. The youngest donor available is preferred.[73,74] CMV status of the recipient. CMV-negative donor matched to CMV-negative recipient and  CMV-positive donor matched to CMV-positive recipient are preferred.[75] Donor blood type. Matching of blood type between donor and recipient is preferred, although not required.  If only blood type–mismatched donors are available, a minor mismatch is preferred over a major mismatch.[76-78] Donor sex and parity of female donors. Male or nonparous female donors are preferred over parous female donors.[74,79] It is rare for a donor-recipient pair to fit perfectly into this algorithm, and determining which of these characteristics should be chosen over others has been controversial. Evidence (donor-recipient characteristics): A CIBMTR study examined 6,349 patients who underwent transplant for hematological malignancies from 1988 to 2006. The study tested the effect of donor characteristics while adjusting for disease risk and other key transplant characteristics. The data from this study showed the following:[74]  In addition to HLA mismatching, older donor age and major or minor ABO blood type mismatching increased overall mortality.Parous female graft recipients experienced lower rates of relapse.Recipients of younger donor grafts had lower rates of acute GVHD.Recipients of parous female grafts had higher rates of chronic GVHD.Recipient CMV status was more important than donor CMV status (recipients who are CMV-positive are at higher risk of mortality independent of the donor CMV status), although a CMV-negative donor to a CMV-negative recipient combination improves survival. A CIBMTR confirmation cohort of 4,690 patients who underwent transplant between 2007 and 2011 was tested by a multivariate analysis for independent predictors of survival in an EBMT study. The study demonstrated the following results:[80]Older donor age was confirmed to be independently associated with worse OS; every 10 years of donor age increased the risk of mortality by 5.5%.  HLA matching continued to have the most important effect on survival; ABO mismatching was not confirmed to have a continuing effect. A study of over 10,000 matched donor-recipient pairs attempted to define a hierarchy that could prioritize the non-HLA characteristics (donor age, sex, blood type, CMV status, etc.) that have been described to affect outcomes.[81]  Although the study was unable to create a hierarchical algorithm of modifiable factors, it showed that, by far, younger donor age is the most important factor, with a decrease in OS of 3% for every 10-year increment of increased donor age. In addition to HLA mismatching, older donor age and major or minor ABO blood type mismatching increased overall mortality. Parous female graft recipients experienced lower rates of relapse. Recipients of younger donor grafts had lower rates of acute GVHD. Recipients of parous female grafts had higher rates of chronic GVHD. Recipient CMV status was more important than donor CMV status (recipients who are CMV-positive are at higher risk of mortality independent of the donor CMV status), although a CMV-negative donor to a CMV-negative recipient combination improves survival. Older donor age was confirmed to be independently associated with worse OS; every 10 years of donor age increased the risk of mortality by 5.5%. HLA matching continued to have the most important effect on survival; ABO mismatching was not confirmed to have a continuing effect. Although the study was unable to create a hierarchical algorithm of modifiable factors, it showed that, by far, younger donor age is the most important factor, with a decrease in OS of 3% for every 10-year increment of increased donor age. Thus, after HLA matching, donor age is likely the most important factor to optimize. Of note, if the recipient is CMV negative, finding a CMV-negative donor is also a high priority. Several studies have attempted to identify characteristics of the best donors for haploidentical procedures.  As with conventional bone marrow transplant, use of younger donors appears to be beneficial, but data regarding donor sex are inconclusive.  Studies involving intense T-cell depletion have noted better outcomes using maternal donors,[82] but studies using posttransplant cyclophosphamide or intense immune suppression seem to favor male donors.[83,84]  Further study is needed to clarify this important issue. One large comparison of haploidentical donors showed an effect of ABO incompatibility on engraftment (risk of rejection doubling from 6% to 12%, ABO match vs. ABO major mismatch), and patients receiving bidirectionally mismatched donors had a 2.4-fold increase in grades II to IV acute GVHD.[85] As with nonhaploidentical donors, significant improvement of outcomes has been noted when younger donors are used for haploidentical procedures compared with older donors, with an HR of 1.13 for each decade of life that the donor is older.[86] Barker JN, Byam CE, Kernan NA, et al.: Availability of cord blood extends allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant access to racial and ethnic minorities.

This is called a preparative regimen, and the original intent of this treatment was to: Create bone marrow space in the recipient for the donor cells to engraft. Suppress the immune system or eliminate the recipient T cells to minimize risk of rejection. Intensely treat cancer (if present) with high doses of active agents to overcome therapy resistance. With the recognition that donor T cells can facilitate engraftment and kill tumors through graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects (obviating the need to create bone marrow space and intensely treat cancer), reduced-intensity or minimal-intensity HSCT approaches focusing on immune suppression rather than myeloablation have been developed.  The resulting lower toxicity associated with these regimens has led to lower rates of transplant-related mortality and expanded eligibility for allogeneic HSCT to older individuals and younger patients with pre-HSCT comorbidities that put them at risk of severe toxicity after standard HSCT approaches.[1] Existing preparative regimens vary tremendously in the amount of immunosuppression and myelosuppression they cause, with the lowest-intensity regimens relying heavily on a strong graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect (see Figure 3). EnlargeFigure 3.  Selected preparative regimens frequently used in pediatric HSCT categorized by current definitions as nonmyeloablative, reduced intensity, or myeloablative. Although FLU plus treosulfan and FLU plus busulfan (full dose) are considered myeloablative approaches, these and similar approaches are called reduced-toxicity regimens. Although these regimens lead to varying degrees of myelosuppression and immune suppression, they have been grouped clinically into the following three major categories (see Figure 4):[2] Myeloablative: Intense approaches that cause irreversible pancytopenia that requires stem cell rescue for restoration of hematopoiesis. Nonmyeloablative: Regimens that cause minimal cytopenias and do not require stem cell support. Reduced-intensity conditioning: Regimens that are of intermediate intensity and do not meet the definitions of nonmyeloablative or myeloablative regimens. EnlargeFigure 4.  Classification of conditioning regimens in 3 categories, based on duration of pancytopenia and requirement for stem cell support. Myeloablative regimens (MA) produce irreversible pancytopenia and require stem cell support. Nonmyeloablative regimens (NMA) produce minimal cytopenia and would not require stem cell support. Reduced-intensity regimens (RIC) are regimens which cannot be classified as MA nor NMA.

For years, retrospective studies showed similar outcomes using reduced-intensity and myeloablative approaches.[3,4]  However, a Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network trial of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who were randomly assigned to receive either myeloablative or reduced-intensity HSCT approaches demonstrated the importance of regimen intensity.[5] At 18 months, relapse was markedly higher in the reduced-intensity cohort (48% vs. 13.5%, P < .001). Although treatment-related mortality was higher in the myeloablative arm (16% vs. 4%, P = .002), relapse-free survival rates were superior (69% vs. 47%, P < .01) and overall survival (OS) rates were higher  in the myeloablative arm (76% vs. 68%), with a nonsignificant P value  of .07. With this in mind, the use of reduced-intensity conditioning and nonmyeloablative regimens is well established in older adults who cannot tolerate more intense myeloablative approaches,[6-8] but these approaches have been studied in a limited number of younger patients with malignancies.[9-13]  A large Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium study identified patients at high risk of transplant-related mortality with myeloablative regimens (e.g., history of previous myeloablative transplant, severe organ system dysfunction, or active, invasive fungal infection) and successfully treated these patients with a reduced-intensity regimen.[14] Transplant-related mortality was low in this high-risk group, and long-term survival occurred in most patients with minimal or no detectable disease at the time of transplant.  Because the risks of relapse are higher with these approaches, their use in pediatric cancer is currently limited to patients ineligible for myeloablative regimens and is most likely to be successful when patients have achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)–negative remissions.[14] Intense myeloablative approaches almost invariably result in hematopoiesis derived from donor cells upon count recovery after the transplant.  The introduction of reduced-intensity conditioning and nonmyeloablative approaches into HSCT practice has resulted in a slower pace of transition to donor hematopoiesis (gradually increasing from partial to full donor hematopoiesis over months) that sometimes remains partial. DNA-based techniques have been established to differentiate donor from recipient hematopoiesis, applying the word chimerism to describe whether all or part of hematopoiesis after HSCT is from the donor or recipient. There are several implications regarding the pace and extent of donor chimerism achieved by an HSCT recipient.  For patients receiving reduced-intensity conditioning or nonmyeloablative regimens, rapid progression to full donor chimerism is associated with lower relapse rates but more graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).[15]  The delayed pace of obtaining full donor chimerism after reduced-intensity regimens has led to late-onset acute GVHD, occurring as late as 6 to 7 months after HSCT (generally occurs within 100 days after myeloablative approaches).[16]  A portion of patients achieve stable mixed chimerism of both donor and recipient.  Mixed chimerism is associated with more relapse after HSCT for malignancies and less GVHD; however, this condition is often advantageous for nonmalignant HSCT, where usually only a percentage of normal hematopoiesis is needed to correct the underlying disorder and GVHD is not beneficial.[17]  Finally, serially measured decreasing donor chimerism, especially T-cell–specific chimerism, has been associated with increased risk of rejection.[18] Because of the implications of persistent recipient chimerism, most transplant programs test for chimerism shortly after engraftment and continue testing regularly until stable full donor hematopoiesis has been achieved.  Investigators have defined two approaches to treat the increased risks of relapse and rejection associated with increasing recipient chimerism: rapid withdrawal of immune suppression and donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI).   These approaches are frequently used to address this issue, and they have been shown to decrease relapse risk and stop rejection in some cases.[19-21]  The timing of tapers of immune suppression and doses and approaches to administration of DLI to increase or stabilize donor chimerism vary among transplant approaches and institutions.

Investigators quickly showed that allogeneic approaches led to a decreased risk of relapse caused by an immunotherapeutic reaction of the new bone marrow graft against tumor antigens.  This phenomenon came to be termed the GVL or graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect and has been associated with mismatches to both major and minor HLA antigens. The GVL effect is challenging to use therapeutically because of a strong association between GVL and clinical graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).  For standard approaches to HSCT, the highest survival rates have been associated with mild or moderate GVHD (grades I to II in acute myeloid leukemia [AML] and grades I to III in acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]), compared with patients who have no GVHD and experience more relapse or patients with severe GVHD who experience more transplant-related mortality.[1-3]; [4][Level of evidence C2] Understanding when GVL occurs and how to use GVL optimally is challenging.  One method of study compares rates of relapse and survival between patients undergoing myeloablative HSCT with either autologous or allogeneic donors for a given disease. Leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS): A clear advantage has been noted when allogeneic approaches are used for ALL, AML, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and MDS.  For ALL and AML specifically, autologous HSCT approaches for most high-risk patient groups have shown results similar to those obtained with chemotherapy, while allogeneic approaches produced superior results.[5,6] Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL): Patients with HL  or NHL generally fare better with autologous approaches, although there may be a role for allogeneic approaches in relapsed lymphoblastic lymphoma, lymphoma that is poorly responsive to chemotherapy, or lymphoma that has relapsed after autologous HSCT.[7] Further insights into the therapeutic benefit of GVL/GVT for given diseases have come from the use of reduced-intensity preparative regimens. This approach to transplant relies on GVL because, in most cases, the intensity of the preparative regimen is not sufficient for cure.  Although studies have shown benefit for patients pursuing this approach when they are ineligible for standard transplant,[8]   this approach has not been used for most children with cancer who require HSCT because pediatric cancer patients can generally undergo myeloablative approaches safely.  For more information, see the Allogeneic HSCT Preparative Regimens section. GVL can be achieved therapeutically through the infusion of cells after transplant that either specifically or nonspecifically target the tumor. The most common approach is the use of DLI. This approach relies on the persistence of donor T-cell engraftment after transplant to prevent rejection of donor lymphocytes infused to induce GVL. Therapeutic DLI results in potent responses in patients with CML who relapse after transplant (60%–80% enter into long-term remission),[9] but responses in patients with other diseases (such as AML and ALL) have been less potent, with long-term survival rates of only 20% to 30%.[10] DLI works poorly in patients with acute leukemia who relapse early and who have high levels of active disease.  Late relapse (>6 months after transplant) and the treatment of patients into complete remission with chemotherapy before DLI have been associated with improved outcomes.[11] Infusions of donor lymphocytes modified to enhance GVL or other donor cells (natural killer [NK] cells, etc.) have also been studied, but have yet to be generally adopted. Another method of delivering GVL therapeutically is the rapid withdrawal of immune suppression after HSCT.  Some studies have scheduled more rapid immune suppression tapers based on donor type (related donors  are tapered more quickly than are unrelated donors because of less GVHD risk), and others have used sensitive measures of either low levels of persistent recipient cells (recipient chimerism) or minimal residual disease to assess the risk of relapse and trigger rapid taper of immune suppression. A combination of early withdrawal of immune suppression after HSCT with DLI to prevent relapse in patients at high risk of relapse because of persistent/progressive recipient chimerism has been tested in patients who underwent transplant for both ALL and AML.[12][Level of evidence B4]; [13][Level of evidence C2] ALL:   One study found increasing recipient chimerism in 46 of 101 patients with ALL.  Thirty-one of those patients had withdrawal of immune suppression, and a portion went on to receive DLI if GVHD did not occur.  This group had a 37% survival rate, compared with 0% in the 15 patients who did not undergo this approach (P < .001).[14] AML: About 20% of patients with AML experienced mixed chimerism after HSCT and were identified as high risk.  Of these, 54% survived if they underwent withdrawal of immune suppression with or without DLI; there were no survivors among those who did not receive this therapy.[15] Donor-derived NK cells in the post-HSCT setting have been shown to promote the following:[16-18] Engraftment. Decreased GVHD. Fewer relapses of hematological malignancies. Improved survival. NK-cell function is modulated by interactions with a number of receptor families, including activating and inhibiting KIR.  The KIR effect in the allogeneic HSCT setting hinges on the expression of specific inhibitory KIR on donor-derived NK cells and either the presence or absence of their matching HLA class I molecules (KIR ligands) on recipient leukemic and normal cells.  Normally, the presence of specific KIR ligands interacting with paired inhibitory KIR molecules prevents NK cell attacks on healthy cells.  In the allogeneic transplant setting, recipient leukemia cells genetically differ from donor NK cells, and they may not have the appropriate inhibitory KIR ligand.  Mismatch of ligand and receptor allows NK-cell–based killing of recipient leukemia cells to proceed for certain donor-recipient genetic combinations. The original observation of decreased relapse with certain KIR-ligand combinations was made in the setting of T-cell–depleted haploidentical transplant and was strongest after HSCT for AML.[17,19]  However, some haploidentical transplant studies have not shown this effect.[20]  Along with decreasing relapse, these studies have suggested a decrease in GVHD with appropriate KIR-ligand combinations.  Many subsequent studies did not detect survival effects for KIR-incompatible HSCT using standard transplant methods,[21-24] which has led to the conclusion that T-cell depletion may be necessary to remove other forms of inhibitory cellular interactions. Decreased relapse and better survival have been noted with donor/recipient KIR-ligand incompatibility after cord blood HSCT, a relatively T-cell–depleted procedure.[25,26] In contrast to this notion, one study demonstrated that some KIR mismatching combinations (activating receptor KIR2DS1 with the HLA C1 ligand) can lead to decreased relapse after AML HSCT without T-cell depletion.[27]  The role of KIR incompatibility in sibling donor HSCT and in diseases other than AML is controversial, but in pediatrics, at least two groups have found better outcomes with specific types of KIR mismatching in ALL.[28-30] A current challenge associated with studies of KIR is that several different approaches have been used to determine what is KIR incompatible and what are the most favorable combinations of KIR molecules in donor-recipient pairs.[19,31,32]  Activating KIR molecules have also been shown to contribute to the effect.[33] The standardization of classification and prospective studies should help clarify the utility and importance of this approach.  Because a limited number of centers perform haploidentical HSCT and the results of other approaches to HSCT are preliminary, most transplant programs do not use KIR mismatching as part of their strategy for choosing a donor.  Full HLA matching is considered most important for outcome, with considerations of KIR mismatching or choosing donors with favorable KIR activation profiles remaining secondary. With a low risk of GVHD and demonstrated efficacy in decreasing relapse in posthaploidentical HSCT settings, NK-cell infusions as a method of treating high-risk patients and consolidating patients in remission have been studied: Evidence (NK-cell transplant outcomes): A University of Minnesota research group compared approaches with different NK-cell populations.[34]The study initially failed to demonstrate efficacy with autologous NK cells, but it found that intense immunoablative therapy followed by purified haploidentical NK cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) maintenance led to remission in 5 of 19 high-risk patients with AML. Researchers at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital treated ten intermediate-risk patients with AML who had completed chemotherapy and were in remission with lower-dose immunosuppression followed by haploidentical NK-cell infusions and IL-2 for consolidation.[35]  Expansion of NK cells was noted in all nine of the KIR-incompatible donor-recipient pairs.  All ten children remained in remission at 2 years.  A follow-up  phase II study is under way, as are many investigations into NK-cell therapy for a number of cancer types.Although early survival rates in this high-risk AML cohort are high, multicenter confirmatory studies will be necessary to establish the efficacy of these types of NK-cell approaches. Other investigators have used expanded/activated NK cells before and after HSCT.[36]  One approach that included the culturing of haploidentical NK cells with membrane-bound IL-21 showed marked expansion and high activity.  These cells were then infused just before haploidentical HSCT, followed by additional infusions on day 7 and 28 after HSCT.[36] The study initially failed to demonstrate efficacy with autologous NK cells, but it found that intense immunoablative therapy followed by purified haploidentical NK cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) maintenance led to remission in 5 of 19 high-risk patients with AML.

For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the ClinicalTrials.gov website. The following is an example of a national and/or institutional clinical trial that is currently being conducted: ASCT2031 (NCT05457556)   (Mismatched Related Donor [Haplo] Versus Matched Unrelated Donor [MUD] Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant [HSCT] for Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults with Acute Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome [MDS]): This is a phase III randomized controlled trial that will compare outcomes between haplo HSCT and MUD HSCT for patients with acute leukemias or MDS. Patients with both available donor sources (MUD and haplo) will be randomly assigned to either Arm A (haplo HSCT) or Arm B (MUD HSCT). The randomization will be stratified by patient age, complete remission status, and disease type. Patients who do not have both an available MUD and haplo donor, but do have a haplo donor, will be assigned to Arm C and receive a nonrandomized haplo HSCT. Arm C is expected to enroll a higher fraction of minority patients because they lack MUDs more often than White patients. This third arm will allow direct comparisons of haplo HSCT outcomes between minority and White patients. The clinically relevant end points, severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and disease-free survival (DFS) in haplo HSCT versus MUD HSCT will be compared as co-primary objectives. The hypothesis is that the incidence of severe GVHD will be less frequent and DFS will be noninferior for haplo HSCT than MUD HSCT.

Treatment  Bile Duct Cancer (Cholangiocarcinoma)  Childhood Liver Cancer  Health Professional  Research Advances   Causes, Risk Factors, & Prevention  Screening  Diagnosis  Stages  Treatment  There are different types of treatment for  patients with liver cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.  Types of treatment  Treatment of localized liver cancer  Treatment of locally advanced or metastatic liver cancer  Treatment of recurrent liver cancer  Surveillance is used for lesions smaller than 1 centimeter found during screening. Follow-up every 3 months is common. Surveillance is closely watching a patient's condition but not giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results that show the condition is getting worse. During active surveillance, certain exams and tests are done on a regular schedule. A partial hepatectomy (surgery to remove the part of the liver where cancer is found) may be done. A wedge of tissue, an entire lobe, or a larger part of the liver, along with some of the healthy tissue around  it is removed. The remaining liver tissue takes over the functions of the liver and may regrow. In a liver transplant, the entire liver is removed and replaced with a healthy donated liver. A liver transplant may be done when the disease is in the liver only and a donated liver can be found. If the patient has to wait for a donated liver, other treatment is given as needed. Ablation therapy removes or destroys tissue. Different types of ablation therapy are used for liver cancer: Radiofrequency ablation: Special needles are inserted directly through the skin or through an incision in the abdomen to reach the tumor. High-energy radio waves heat the needles and tumor which kills cancer cells. Microwave therapy: The tumor is exposed to high temperatures created by microwaves. This can damage and kill cancer cells or make them more sensitive to the effects of radiation and certain anticancer drugs. Percutaneous ethanol injection: A small needle is used to inject ethanol (pure alcohol) directly into a tumor to kill cancer cells. Several treatments may be needed. Usually local anesthesia is used, but if the patient has many tumors in the liver, general anesthesia may be used. Cryoablation: An instrument is used to freeze and destroy cancer cells. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy and cryosurgery. The doctor may use ultrasound to guide the instrument. To learn more, see Cryosurgery to Treat Cancer. Electroporation therapy: Electrical pulses are sent through an electrode placed in a tumor to kill cancer cells. Electroporation therapy is being studied in clinical trials. Embolization therapy is used for patients who cannot have surgery to remove the tumor or ablation therapy and whose tumor has not spread outside the liver. Embolization therapy is the use of substances to block or decrease the flow of blood through the hepatic artery to the tumor. When the tumor does not get the oxygen and nutrients it needs, it will not continue to grow. The liver receives blood from the hepatic portal vein and the hepatic artery. Blood that comes into the liver from the hepatic portal vein usually goes to the healthy liver tissue. Blood that comes from the hepatic artery usually goes to the tumor. When the hepatic artery is blocked during embolization therapy, the healthy liver tissue continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein. There are two main types of embolization therapy: Transarterial embolization (TAE): A small incision (cut) is made in the inner thigh and a catheter (thin, flexible tube) is inserted and threaded up into the hepatic artery. Once the catheter is in place, a substance that blocks the hepatic artery and stops blood flow to the tumor is injected. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE): This procedure is like TAE except an anticancer drug is also given. The procedure can be done by attaching the anticancer drug to small beads that are injected into the hepatic artery or by injecting the anticancer drug through the catheter into the hepatic artery and then injecting the substance to block the hepatic artery. Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. This type of treatment is also called chemoembolization. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies used to treat advanced liver cancer include the following: bevacizumab cabozantinib lenvatinib ramucirumab regorafenib sorafenib To learn more about targeted therapy and its side effects, see Targeted Therapy to Treat Cancer. Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a type of immunotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors that may be used to treat liver cancer include the following: atezolizumab with the targeted therapy bevacizumab nivolumab with ipilimumab pembrolizumab durvalumab with tremelimumab To learn more about immunotherapy and its side effects, see Immunotherapy to Treat Cancer and Immunotherapy Side Effects. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Radiation is given in a series of treatments to allow healthy cells to recover and to make radiation more effective. The number of treatments is based on details about the cancer, such as the size and location of the tumor. Certain ways of giving external radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue: Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional, or 3-D, picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue. Stereotactic body radiation therapy: Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue. This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy. Proton beam radiation therapy: Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells. This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy tissue near a tumor. To learn more about radiation therapy and its side effects, see Radiation Therapy to Treat Cancer and Radiation Therapy Side Effects. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be an option. Use our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. To learn more about clinical trials, see Clinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers. Treatment of localized liver cancer may include the following: surveillance for lesions smaller than 1 centimeter total hepatectomy transplant partial hepatectomy ablation of the tumor using one of the following methods:radiofrequency ablationmicrowave therapypercutaneous ethanol injectioncryoablation radiofrequency ablation microwave therapy percutaneous ethanol injection cryoablation Treatment of locally advanced or metastatic liver cancer may include the following: embolization therapy using transarterial embolization (TAE) or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in people with locally advanced liver cancer. targeted therapy with lenvatinib, sorafenib, regorafenib, cabozantinib, bevacizumab, or ramucirumab immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy with pembrolizumab, nivolumab with ipilimumab, durvalumab with tremelimumab, or atezolizumab with the targeted therapy bevacizumab radiation therapy Treatment options for recurrent primary liver cancer may include the following: total hepatectomy and liver transplant partial hepatectomy ablation transarterial chemoembolization and targeted therapy with sorafenib as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life  Updated:

Milestones Timeline


DCB Investigators   Advances in Cancer Biology Research  Milestones Timeline  DCB Investigators  For more than 25 years, the Division of Cancer Biology (DCB) has been supporting progress in basic cancer research as an extramural division of NCI. This timeline shows some of the programs, research, and events of DCB over time. 2023: Launch of the National Cancer Plan "The National Cancer Plan provides a framework for everyone to collaborate in ending cancer as we know it." DCB supports basic scientific discovery that is advancing progress towards achieving the eight goals of the plan. 2022: DCB Investigator-Initiated Research 2021 - 2022: DCB Research Programs DCB research programs were initiated to examine the development of cancers, the role of the tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer, metastasis, and acquired resistance to cancer therapies. These initiatives include: Acquired Resistance to Therapy Network (ARTNet)  Metastasis Research Network  Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Stromal Reprogramming Consortium (PSRC)  Program on the Origins of Gastroesophageal Cancers  Translational and Basic Science Research in Early Lesions (TBEL)  2020: Start of the COVID-19 Pandemic Health and Human Services (HHS) declared a public health emergency as a result of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. During this time, DCB staff continued to work from home to advance basic cancer research and supported NCI COVID-19 research initiatives. 2019: DCB Managed R01 Research Grants 2017: Launch of the Cancer Moonshot Many DCB staff were involved in launching the Cancer Moonshot. As leaders and members of Cancer Moonshot Implementation Teams, they helped develop research initiatives in response to the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Panel. 2016: Changes to DCB Organization The Tumor Biology and Metastasis Branch was divided into the Tumor Biology and Microenvironment Branch and the Tumor Metastasis Branch, based on the growth in this research area. 2014 - 2016: DCB Research Programs DCB research initiatives were launched to address challenging questions in cancer biology using physical sciences, engineering, molecular characterization approaches, and systems biology, as well as to improve the development of models for cancer research. These programs include: Physical Sciences – Oncology Network (PS-ON) (Phase 2)  Oncology Models Forum (OMF)  Molecular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions (MCL)  Cancer Systems Biology Consortium (CSBC)  Cancer Tissue Engineering Collaborative (TEC)  Patient-Derived Models of Cancer (PDMC)  2014: Establishment of Cancer Immunology, Hematology, and Etiology Branch The Cancer Immunology and Hematology Branch was merged with the Cancer Etiology Branch into the Cancer Immunology, Hematology, and Etiology Branch since both research areas involved interactions with the immune system. 2011: Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network (BETRNET) This program, supported by DCB and the NCI Division of Cancer Prevention, was established to address the rising incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in the United States. 2009: Exploratory/Developmental Grants Program for Basic Cancer Research in Cancer Health Disparities Interested in conducting basic research in the biological/genetic causes of cancer health disparities? Apply for FOA PAR-21-322. This ongoing program, supported by DCB and the NCI Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities, was started to support basic research studies investigating the causes and mechanisms of cancer health disparities. 2006: Tumor Microenvironment Network (TMEN) The main objectives of TMEN were to delineate mechanisms of tumor-stroma interactions in cancer and to generate a comprehensive understanding of the roles of stroma in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. objectives of TMEN were to delineate mechanisms of tumor-stroma interactions in cancer and to generate a comprehensive understanding of the roles of stroma in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. 2004: Integrative Cancer Biology Program (ICBP) The ICBP promoted the application of a systems- or integrative- biology approach to the study of cancer. The goal of the program was to create reliably predictive computational models of various cancer processes that could be used to generate more rationally designed interventions for preventing, detecting, and treating cancer. ICBP ran for 10 years and was the precursor to the Cancer Systems Biology Consortium (CSBC). For more information, please reference the detailed summary of the program. 2003: DCB Think Tanks DCB held a series of Think Tanks to identify emerging concepts and promising opportunities for investigation across nine scientific areas with unusual promise for rapid progress: Cancer Susceptibility and Resistance  Cell Decision Making Mechanisms  Epigenetics  Etiology in Cancer  Inflammation and Cancer  Integrative Cancer Biology  Tumor Immunology  Tumor Microenvironment  Tumor Stem Cells  2002: NIGMS and NCI Structural Biology Facility at the Advanced Photon Source NCI, NIGMS, and the Argonne National Laboratory signed an agreement to build new biological research capabilities (i.e., beamlines for structural biology research) at the Advanced Photon Source. DCB manages the beamline for NCI, which has a significant amount of beamtime dedicated for the use of its grantees. 2001: Launch of the New Grantee Workshop Check out presentations and other resources from the latest New Grantee Workshop. The goal of this DCB workshop was to help new grantees make the transition from early stage/new investigators to established investigators. Since this initial meeting, it has been held every year and has been attended by over 1000 new grantees. 1999: Mouse Models of Human Cancer Consortium (MMHCC) Through extensive discussions with cancer researchers, NCI identified the crucial need for improved animal model systems to inform all aspects of cancer research and improve patient outcomes. To address this issue, DCB created a program to foster the high-risk efforts needed to develop accurate, reproducible mouse models of human cancers. The consortium continued for 15 years (through 2014) and a 2009 report about the program was published in Disease Models and Mechanisms. 1998: Activities to Promote Research Collaboration (APRC) 1995: Bishop-Calabresi Report Based on the recommendations of the Bishop-Calabresi Report by an Ad Hoc Working Group of the National Cancer Advisory Board, DCB was established as part of the NCI Extramural Research Program. The division was initially organized into the Office of the Director and 5 branches: Cancer Biology  Cancer Immunology  Biological Carcinogenesis  Physical and Chemical Carcinogenesis  Radiation Effects   Updated:

Cancer treatments may affect your fertility  Emotional considerations and support for fertility issues  Fertility preservation options for girls and women  Finding more information, support, and clinical trials  Cancer treatments may affect your fertility Emotional considerations and support for fertility issues Fertility preservation options for girls and women Finding more information, support, and clinical trials Many cancer treatments can affect a girl’s or woman’s fertility. Most likely, your doctor will talk with you about whether or not cancer treatment may increase the risk of, or cause, infertility. However, not all doctors bring up this topic. Sometimes you, a family member, or parents of a child being treated for cancer may need to initiate this conversation. Whether or not fertility is affected depends on factors such as: your baseline fertility  your age at the time of treatment  the type of cancer and treatment(s)  the amount (dose) of treatment  the length (duration) of treatment  the amount of time that has passed since cancer treatment  other personal health factors  It’s important to learn how the recommended cancer treatment may affect fertility before starting treatment, whenever possible. Consider asking questions such as: Could treatment increase the risk of, or cause, infertility? Could treatment make it difficult to become pregnant or carry a pregnancy in the future?  Are there other recommended cancer treatments that might not cause fertility problems?  Which fertility option(s) would you advise for me?  What fertility preservation options are available at this hospital? At a fertility clinic?  Would you recommend a fertility specialist (such as a reproductive endocrinologist) who I could talk with to learn more?  Is condom use advised, based on the treatment I’m receiving?  Is birth control recommended?  After treatment, what are the chances that my fertility will return? How long might it take for my fertility to return?  Learn more about managing and coping with side effects related to Sexual Health Issues in Women. Cancer treatments may affect your fertility Cancer treatments are important for your future health, but they may harm reproductive organs and glands that control fertility. Changes to your fertility may be temporary or permanent. Talk with your health care team to learn what to expect, based on your treatment(s): Chemotherapy (especially alkylating agents) can affect the ovaries, causing them to stop releasing eggs and estrogen. This is called primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). Sometimes POI is temporary and your menstrual periods and fertility return after treatment. Other times, damage to your ovaries is permanent and fertility doesn’t return. You may have hot flashes, night sweats, irritability, vaginal dryness, and irregular or no menstrual periods. Chemotherapy can also lower the number of healthy eggs in the ovaries. Women who are closer to the age of natural menopause may have a greater risk of infertility. The National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has more information about primary ovarian insufficiency.  Radiation therapy to or near the abdomen, pelvis, or spine can harm nearby reproductive organs. Some organs, such as the ovaries, can often be protected by ovarian shielding or by oophoropexy—a procedure that surgically moves the ovaries away from the radiation area. Radiation therapy to the brain can also harm the pituitary gland. This gland is important because it sends signals to the ovaries to make hormones such as estrogen that are needed for ovulation. The amount of radiation given and the part of your body being treated both play a role in whether or not fertility is affected.  Surgery for cancers of the reproductive system and for cancers in the pelvis region can harm nearby reproductive tissues and cause scarring, which can affect your fertility. The size and location of the tumor are important factors in whether or not fertility is affected.  Hormone therapy (also called endocrine therapy) used to treat cancer can disrupt the menstrual cycle, which may affect your fertility. Side effects depend on the specific hormones used and may include hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness.  Bone marrow transplants, peripheral blood stem cell transplants, and other stem cell transplants involve receiving high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation. These treatments can damage the ovaries and may cause infertility.  Other treatments: Talk with your doctor to learn whether or not other types of treatment such as immunotherapy and targeted cancer therapy may affect your fertility.  Emotional considerations and support for fertility issues For some women, infertility can be one of the most difficult and upsetting long-term effects of cancer treatment. While it might feel overwhelming to think about your fertility right now, most people benefit from having talked with their doctor (or their child’s doctor, when a child is being treated for cancer) about how treatment may affect their fertility and about options to preserve fertility. Although most people want to have children at some point in their life, families can come together in many ways. For extra support during this time, reach out to your health care team with questions or concerns, as well as to professionally led support groups. If you are the parent of a young girl or teen with cancer, this video of fertility options for young female cancer patients from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia may help you talk with your daughter and her doctor. Fertility preservation options for girls and women The finding supports offering fertility preservation as part of standard care, experts say. Women and girls with cancer have options to preserve their fertility. These procedures may be available at the hospital where you are receiving cancer treatment or at a fertility preservation clinic. Talk with your doctor about the best option(s) for you based on your age, the type of cancer you have, and the specific treatment(s) you will be receiving. The success rate, financial cost, and availability of these procedures varies. Egg freezing (also called egg or oocyte cryopreservation) is a procedure in which eggs are removed from the ovary and frozen. Later the eggs can be thawed, fertilized with sperm in the lab to form embryos, and placed in a woman’s uterus. Egg freezing is a newer procedure than embryo freezing.  Embryo freezing (also called embryo banking or embryo cryopreservation) is a procedure in which eggs are removed from the ovary. They are then fertilized with sperm in the lab to form embryos and frozen for future use.  Ovarian shielding (also called gonadal shielding) is a procedure in which a protective cover is placed on the outside of the body, over the ovaries and other parts of the reproductive system, to shield them from scatter radiation.  Ovarian tissue freezing (also called ovarian tissue cryopreservation) is still considered an experimental procedure, for young girls who haven’t gone through puberty and don’t have mature eggs. It involves surgically removing part or all of an ovary and then freezing the ovarian tissue, which contains eggs. Later, the tissue is thawed and placed back in a woman. Although pregnancies have occurred as a result of this procedure, it’s only an option for some types of cancer.  Ovarian transposition (also called oophoropexy) is an operation to move the ovaries away from the part of the body receiving radiation. This procedure may be done during surgery to remove the cancer or through laparoscopic surgery.  Radical trachelectomy (also called radical cervicectomy) is surgery used to treat women with early-stage cervical cancer who would like to have children. This operation removes the cervix, nearby lymph nodes, and the upper part of the vagina. The uterus is then attached to the remaining part of the vagina, with a special band that serves as the cervix.  Treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (also called GnRHa), a substance that causes the ovaries to stop making estrogen and progesterone. Research is ongoing to assess the effectiveness of giving GnRHa to protect the ovaries.  If you choose to take steps to preserve your fertility, your doctor and a fertility specialist will work together to develop a treatment plan that includes fertility preservation, whenever possible.

What women can do about changes in sexuality and fertility caused by radiation therapy. You may be wondering if radiation therapy could affect your sex life. Let's listen to a discussion between Dr. Williams and women in a support group as they talk first about sexuality issues that relate to all women getting radiation therapy. And then to questions from women receiving radiation therapy to the pelvic area - such as to the vagina, uterus, or ovaries - about fertility issues. Let's listen in on their discussion. Gina:
Dr. Williams, I'm Gina. My husband and I had a pretty active sex life before I started treatment. Now, I'm just not in the mood. Is this normal? Dr. Williams:
Yes it is, Gina. You're going through a lot these days. Coping with cancer, feeling very tired, or being in pain can lower sexual desires. Try to be easy on yourself. It can help to talk with your husband about what you're feeling. There are many ways to stay close during this time other than having sex. Holding, hugging, and cuddling are ways that help many people stay connected. Kim:
That's true, Dr. Williams. My partner and I sit side by side when we watch TV. And sometimes we give each other backrubs. My question is about whether or not I need to use birth control during radiation therapy. Dr. Williams:
Yes, women who've not yet gone through menopause and who are having intercourse should talk with their doctor about birth control and ways to keep from getting pregnant. It's very important not to get pregnant during radiation therapy. The treatment can harm an unborn baby. Cara:
Dr. Williams, I am getting radiation to my pelvis, and it's causing some changes in my vagina. It feels dry and itchy, and, frankly, sex hurts. Dr. Williams:
I'm sorry to hear that. This is a common side effect for women getting radiation to the pelvis. Many women are helped by products such as Replens, Astroglide, or K-Y liquid. These products help make the vagina moist. Your doctor may also suggest a gel or cream to stop an itchy, dry, or burning feeling. In some cases, something called a dilator can also help. It stretches the vagina. Talk with your nurse to learn more about this product. Cara:
Dr. Williams, before I got cancer my husband and I were ready to start a family. Now I'm not so sure if that's going to be possible. What can we do? Dr. Williams:
Cara, I'm glad you asked about that. First, it's good to know that there are more fertility options these days than there used to be. It's best to talk with your doctor before treatment starts if you'll be receiving radiation therapy to the pelvis and would like to get pregnant after radiation therapy. Your doctor can talk with you about things you can do now to plan for the future or refer you to a fertility specialist. Any more questions? Well, okay—it's been a pleasure to talk with all of you. I'll be staying around to answer any individual questions that you may have. Narrator Summary:
Remember—you may have less desire for sex during radiation therapy. Talk with your partner to find new ways to show affection and feel connected. If you are having sex, make sure to use birth control since radiation therapy can harm an unborn baby. And for women getting radiation to the pelvis there are 2 suggestions: First, ask your nurse about products that can help make the vagina feel more comfortable or stretch the vagina. Second, talk with your doctor before treatment if you are interested in having children after treatment. There are things you can do now to plan for the future. Finally, be sure to talk with your health care team to learn more about how to manage and prepare for any changes in sexuality and fertility that may happen.

Pain can be managed before, during, and after tests and procedures. Different cancer treatments  may cause specific types of pain. Peripheral neuropathy is a type of pain that can be caused by chemotherapy. Cancer pain may continue after treatment ends. Pain control can improve your quality of life. Each patient needs a personal plan to control cancer pain. Pain is one of the most common symptoms in cancer patients. Pain can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment, or a combination of factors. Tumors, surgery, intravenous chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy,  therapies such as bisphosphonates, and diagnostic procedures may cause you pain. Younger patients are more likely to have cancer pain and pain flares than older patients. Patients with advanced cancer have more severe pain, and many cancer survivors have pain that continues after cancer treatment ends. This summary  is about ways to control cancer pain in adults. Some tests and procedures are painful.  It helps to start pain control before a procedure begins.  Some drugs may be used to help you feel calm or fall asleep.  Therapies such as imagery or relaxation can also help control pain and anxiety related to treatment. 
        To help lower your anxiety, ask about the test before it begins so you know what to expect.  Have a family member or friend stay with you during the procedure. Patients may have different types of pain from the treatments they receive, including: Postoperative pain. Spasms, stinging, and itching caused by  intravenous chemotherapy. Mucositis caused by chemotherapy or  targeted therapy. Ostealgia (bone pain) caused by filgrastim or pegfilgrastim, which are granulocyte colony-stimulating factors that help the body make more white blood cells. Peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Pain in joints and muscles caused by paclitaxel  or aromatase inhibitor therapy. Osteonecrosis of the jaw caused by  bisphosphonates given for cancer that has spread to the bone. Avascular necrosis caused by long-term use of corticosteroids. Pain syndromes caused by radiation therapy, including:Pain from brachytherapy.Pain from lying in the same position during treatment.Mucositis (inflammation of the mucous membranes in areas that were treated with radiation).Dermatitis.Pain flares. Pain from brachytherapy. Pain from lying in the same position during treatment. Mucositis (inflammation of the mucous membranes in areas that were treated with radiation). Dermatitis. Pain flares. Peripheral neuropathy is a nerve problem that can cause pain, numbness, and tingling in the hands and feet. Patients on chemotherapy may  have chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). In some patients, CIPN may continue after chemotherapy has ended. Studies of drugs and natural products used to treat CIPN have shown mixed results. Duloxetine is a drug that has been studied to treat CIPN. Studies of acupuncture for CIPN have been reported.  For more information about these studies, see the Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy section in Acupuncture. Pain that  is severe or continues after cancer treatment ends increases the risk of anxiety and depression. If you feel  depressed or have anxiety, your pain may feel worse and make it harder to control. Some patients are unable to work because of the pain. Pain can be controlled in most patients who have cancer. Although cancer pain cannot always be relieved completely, there are ways to lessen pain in most patients. Pain control can improve your quality of life during cancer treatment and after it ends. Each person's diagnosis, cancer stage, response to pain, and personal likes and dislikes are different. For this reason, each patient needs a personal plan to control cancer pain. You, your family, and  your healthcare team can work together
to manage  your pain. As part of your pain control plan, your healthcare provider can give you  and your family members written instructions to manage your pain at home.  Ask your healthcare provider who you should call  if you have 
questions about your pain. Your healthcare team will ask you about your pain to determine the best treatment. Physical and neurological exams will be done to help plan pain control. It's important that the cause
of your pain is found early and treated quickly.
Your healthcare team will help you measure
pain levels often, including at the following times: After you start cancer treatment. After you start  a new pain treatment. When you have new pain. To learn  about your pain, the healthcare team will ask  you  the following questions: When did the pain start? How long does the pain last? Where is the pain?  You will be asked to show exactly where the pain is on your body or on a drawing of a body. How strong is the pain? You will be asked to rate your pain between 1-10, with 10 being the strongest. Have there been changes in where or when the pain occurs? What makes the pain better or worse? Is the pain worse during certain times of the day or night? Is there breakthrough pain? Do you have trouble sleeping, or do you feel tired, depressed, or anxious? Does pain get in the way of  activities of daily life, such as when you eat, bathe, or move around? Your healthcare team will also review your health history, including the following information: Past  and current pain treatments. Prognosis. Other conditions you may have, such as kidney, liver,  or heart disease. Past and current use of nicotine, alcohol, or sleeping pills. Personal or family history of substance use disorder. Personal history of mental health disorders or abuse. Your choices for your pain control plan. The
information you give your healthcare team will be used to decide how to help relieve your pain. Treatment may include drugs or non-drug therapies. In some cases, patients are referred to pain or palliative care specialists. Your healthcare team will work with you to decide whether the benefits of treatment outweigh any risks. They will also let you know how much relief to expect from your pain treatment.  Your doctor will continue to ask you how well your treatment is working and make changes if needed. A family member or caregiver may be asked to give answers for a patient who has  problems with speech,  language, or understanding. The following exams will be done: Physical exam: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. Neurological exam: A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks your mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam. Your healthcare team will also assess your psychological,   social, and spiritual needs. Drugs will be given based on whether your pain is mild, moderate, or severe. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be  used to relieve mild pain. Opioids are used to relieve moderate to severe pain.Most patients with cancer pain will receive opioids on a regular schedule.Opioids are given in different ways.There are common side effects caused by opioids. Other drugs may be added to help treat your pain. Most patients with cancer pain will receive opioids on a regular schedule. Opioids are given in different ways. There are common side effects caused by opioids. Your doctor will prescribe drugs to help relieve your pain. These drugs need to be taken at scheduled times to keep a constant level of the drug in the body to help keep the pain from coming back. Drugs may be taken by mouth or given in other ways, such as by infusion or injection. Your doctor may prescribe extra doses of a drug for pain that occurs between scheduled doses of the drug. The doctor will adjust the drug dose  for your
needs. A scale from 0 to 10 is used to measure how severe the pain is and decide which pain medicine to use. On this scale: 0 means no pain. 1 to 3 means mild pain. 4 to 6 means moderate pain. 7 to 10 means severe pain. Other pain scales that use happy or sad faces may be used for those who have trouble giving their pain a number. These scales are useful for adults who have trouble with memory or thinking, and with young children. Acetaminophen and NSAIDs help relieve mild pain.  They may be given with opioids 
for moderate to severe pain. Pain relievers of this type include: Celecoxib. Diclofenac. Ibuprofen. Ketoprofen. Ketorolac. Side effects of NSAIDs include stomach, kidney, heart, and blood problems.   Patients, especially older patients, who  take acetaminophen or
NSAIDs need to be closely watched for side effects. For more information, see Treating Cancer Pain in Older Patients. Opioids work well to relieve moderate to severe pain. 
Some patients with cancer stop getting pain relief from opioids if they take them for a long time. This is called tolerance. Larger doses or a different opioid may be needed if your body stops responding to the same dose.
Tolerance of an opioid  is a physical dependence on it. This is not the same as addiction (psychological dependence). Since 1999, the number of prescriptions written for opioids and the number of deaths  caused by drug overdose  in the United States have increased. Although most patients who are prescribed opioids for cancer pain use them safely, some patients may become addicted to opioids. Your doctor will  monitor your opioid doses so that you are treated for pain safely. There are several types of opioids: Buprenorphine. Codeine. Fentanyl. Hydrocodone. Hydromorphone. Methadone. Morphine (the most common opioid
for cancer pain). Oxycodone. Oxymorphone. Tapentadol. Tramadol. The doctor will prescribe drugs and the times they should be taken to best control your pain. It is important that patients and family caregivers know how to safely use, store, and dispose of opioids. Opioids are given on a regular
schedule to help relieve the pain and keep it from getting worse.    The amount of time between doses depends on which opioid you take.  The best dose is the amount of opioid that controls your pain
with the fewest side effects.  If opioid
tolerance does occur (the opioid no longer works at the dose you are given), the dose may need to be increased or a different opioid may be prescribed. There is evidence that patients who are prescribed long-acting opioids (for example, medications that work for 8,12, or 24 hours), are more likely to take them as directed. Opioids may be given by the following ways: Mouth: If your stomach and intestines work normally, medicine is usually taken by mouth.     Opioids given orally are easy to use and are usually low-cost. Oral opioids are absorbed when placed under the tongue (sublingual route) or on the inside of the cheek (buccal route). Rectum: If you cannot take opioids by mouth, they may be given as  rectal suppositories. Skin patches: Opioid patches are placed on the skin (transdermal route). Nose spray: Opioids may be given in the form of a  nasal spray. Intravenous (IV) line: Opioids are given into a vein when simpler and less costly
methods cannot be used, don't work, or are not wanted by the patient. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps are one way to control pain through your IV line. A PCA pump allows you to control the amount of drug that is used. With a PCA pump, you can receive a preset opioid dose by pressing a button on a pump that is connected to a small tube. Once the pain is controlled, the doctor may
prescribe regular opioid doses based on the amount you used with  the PCA pump. Subcutaneous injection: Opioids are injected into the fatty layer of tissue just under the skin. Intraspinal injection: Opioids are injected into the fluid around the spinal cord. These may be combined with a local anesthetic to help some patients who have pain that is hard to control. Your doctor will discuss the side effects with you before opioid
treatment begins and will watch you for  side effects.  The following are the most
common side effects: Nausea. Drowsiness. Constipation. Nausea and drowsiness most often occur when opioid treatment
is first started and usually get better within a few days. Opioids slow down the muscle contractions and movement in the stomach and
intestines, which can cause hard stools.  To keep the stool soft and prevent constipation, it's important to drink plenty of fluids, increase fiber in the diet, and get regular exercise.  Unless there are problems such as a blocked bowel or diarrhea, you will be given a treatment plan to prevent constipation  and other digestive problems while taking opioids. Other side effects of
opioid treatment include the following: Dry mouth. Vomiting. Low blood pressure. Dizziness. Trouble sleeping. Trouble thinking clearly. Sedation. Delirium or hallucinations. Muscle jerks. Seizures. Hyperalgesia. Trouble urinating. Breathing problems that may get worse  with sleep apnea, obesity, or    when taking opioids with sedatives. Severe itching. Problems with sexual function. Hot flashes. Depression. Hypoglycemia. Opioids are more likely to cause damage to the nervous system in patients with the following risk factors: Taking morphine or codeine. Older age. Kidney problems. Infection. Dehydration. Talk to your doctor about side effects that bother you  or become severe.  Your doctor may decrease
the dose of the opioid, change to a different opioid, or change the way the
opioid is given to
help decrease the side effects.  For more information about coping with these side effects, see the following: Gastrointestinal Complications Nausea and Vomiting Related to Cancer Treatment Other drugs may be given while you take opioids for pain relief.  These are drugs that help the opioids work better, treat symptoms, and
relieve certain types of pain.  The following types of drugs may be used: Antidepressants. Anticonvulsants. Local anesthetics. Corticosteroids. Bisphosphonates and denosumab. Patients will not always respond in the same way to these drugs. Side effects are
common and should be reported to your doctor. Bisphosphonates (pamidronate, zoledronic acid, and ibandronate) are drugs that may be given when cancer has spread to the bones. They are given as an intravenous infusion and combined with other treatments to decrease pain and reduce risk of broken bones. However, bisphosphonates sometimes cause severe side effects. Talk to your doctor if you have severe muscle or bone pain.  Bisphosphonate therapy may need to be stopped. The use of bisphosphonates is also linked to the risk of bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis (BON).          For more information, see  Oral Complications of Cancer Therapies. Denosumab  is another drug that may be used when cancer has spread to the bones. It is given as a subcutaneous injection and may help prevent and relieve pain. Nerve blocks Neurological treatments Cordotomy Palliative care Radiation therapyExternal radiation therapyRadiopharmaceuticals Physical medicine and rehabilitation Integrative therapies External radiation therapy Radiopharmaceuticals Most  cancer pain can be controlled with drugs, but some patients have too many side effects from drugs or have pain in a certain part of the body that needs to be treated in a different way. Talk to your doctor to help decide which methods work best to relieve your pain. Other treatments include nerve blocks, surgery, radiation therapy and palliative care. A nerve block is the injection of either a local anesthetic or other drug into or around a nerve to block pain. Nerve blocks help control  pain that can't be controlled in other ways.  Nerve blocks may also be used to find  where the pain is coming from,  to predict how the pain will respond to long-term
treatments, and to prevent pain after certain procedures. Surgery can be done to insert a device that delivers drugs or stimulates the nerves with mild electric current. Cordotomy is a less common surgery that is used to relieve pain by cutting certain nerves in the spinal cord. This blocks pain and hot/cold feelings. This procedure may be chosen for patients who are near the end of life and have severe pain that cannot be relieved  in other ways. Certain patients are helped by palliative care services.  Palliative care providers  may also  be called supportive care providers. They work in teams that  include doctors, nurses, mental health specialists, social workers, chaplains, pharmacists, and dietitians. Some of the goals of palliative care are to: Improve quality of life for patients and their families. Manage pain and non-pain symptoms. Support patients who need higher doses of opioids, have a history of substance use disorder, or are coping with emotional and social problems. For more information, see Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care in Advanced Cancer. Radiation therapy is used to relieve pain in patients with skin lesions, tumors, or cancer that has spread to the bone. This is called palliative radiation therapy.   It may be given as local therapy directly to the tumor or to larger areas of the body. Radiation therapy helps drugs and other treatments work better by shrinking tumors that cause pain. Radiation therapy may help patients with bone pain move more freely and with less pain. The following types of radiation therapy may be used: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. External radiation therapy relieves pain from cancer that has spread to the bone. Radiation therapy may be given in a single dose or divided into several smaller doses given over time. The decision to have a single or divided dose may depend on how easy it is to get the treatments and how much they cost. Some patients who find  little or no pain relief from first-time radiation therapy may benefit from repeated radiation therapy. Patients may have a pain flare after receiving palliative radiation therapy for cancer that has spread to the bone, but this side effect is only temporary. Radiopharmaceuticals are drugs that have a radioactive substance that may be used to diagnose or treat disease, including cancer. Radiopharmaceuticals may also be used to relieve pain from cancer that has spread to the bone. A single dose of a radioactive agent injected into a vein may relieve pain when cancer has spread to several areas of bone and/or when there are too many areas to treat with external radiation therapy. Patients with cancer and pain may lose their strength, freedom of movement,  and ability to manage their daily activities. Physical therapy or occupational therapy may help these patients. Physical medicine     uses  physical methods, such as exercise and machines, to prevent and treat disease or injury. Some patients may be referred to a physiatrist (a doctor who specializes in physical medicine) who can develop a personal plan for them. Some physiatrists are also trained in procedures to treat and manage pain. Complementary and alternative therapies combined with standard treatment may be used to treat pain. They are also called integrative therapies. Acupuncture, support groups, and hypnosis are a few integrative therapies that have been used to relieve pain. Certain factors affect cancer pain treatment in older adults.Older patients may be prescribed more than one drug.Doses start at lower levels.Side effects from drugs are more likely in older patients. There is a risk of undertreatment (not receiving enough treatment) in older patients. Older patients may be prescribed more than one drug. Doses start at lower levels. Side effects from drugs are more likely in older patients. There is a risk of undertreatment (not receiving enough treatment) in older patients. Some problems are more likely in patients 65 years and older. For caregivers of these patients, the following should be kept in mind: Older patients may have more than one chronic disease and take several drugs for different conditions. This can increase the risk of drug interactions. 
Drugs taken together can change how they work in the body and   can  affect the patient's chronic diseases. Pain medicine is started at lower doses in older patients and adjusted slowly to allow for differences in their pain threshold, pain expression, and effects on physical and mental function.  Lower doses given to older patients may provide better pain relief that lasts longer than in younger patients. Older patients should be watched closely for side effects from opioids and NSAIDs. See common side effects caused by opioids for more information. Other drugs may be given to avoid side effects from certain NSAIDs: Acetaminophen. Proton pump inhibitors (given with  NSAIDs). Topical NSAIDs. COX-2-selective NSAIDs (NSAIDs that cause fewer problems with the stomach and intestines). Undertreatment in older patients may occur for the following reasons: Patients do not report their pain. Patients are not able to talk about the pain they have. The doctor is concerned about side effects or changes in patient behavior that may be caused by pain medicine. Poor pain control may cause other problems in older patients, including the following: Reduced physical or mental function. Slow recovery. Changes in appetite or sleep. Increased need for care and assistance with health problems. Treating depression in patients can also help with pain treatment. For more information from the National Cancer Institute 
        about cancer pain, see the following: Pain and Cancer Treatment: Side Effects Cancer Pain Control: Support for People with Cancer The Opioid Epidemic and Cancer Pain Management Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish. PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the causes and treatment of pain.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board. A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

Past Programs  Funding  Researcher Resources  News & Events  About DCB  Progress   Past Programs  Marian Waterman, Ph.D., a CSBC investigator at the University of California, Irvine (UC Irvine), began her career as a biochemist using reductionist approaches to investigate gene transcription. As a young investigator, she moved into cancer biology and studied the role of a transcription factor family in colon cancer. Later, the focus in her lab shifted as she realized that a systems biology approach could take data from reductionist experiments and place it in a larger context. Now, Marian integrates mathematical modeling with experimentation to study tumor heterogeneity. In this interview, she discusses obstacles from her career journey, her CSBC research, and a hobby outside of her laboratory. One thing in the personal realm was that, as a postdoc, I met and married a fellow graduate student. We were two scientists trying to start a family and careers. That’s a big task. When it came time to think about blending my career and family, I chose a job offer at UC Irvine where I could live very close to the campus. UC Irvine also had a lot of supportive services for family of faculty and was pretty progressive in spousal placement. My husband is a bioinformaticist and UC Irvine found a position for him as well. The way that I addressed the challenge of blending my family and career was to carefully choose the university where I accepted a job. In the professional realm, being confident as a postdoc and as a new assistant professor was challenging. I’m not a very bold person and was very shy. I had to force myself to take risks and be bold to overcome this obstacle. That started with asking a lot of questions in seminars and getting involved with people. I also started taking risks in my science. The example I like to give is the creation of a resource called the Open Source Wnt Library. At one point in my research, it became very clear that there were reagents lacking to study Wnt ligands. I took a risk and started crowdsourcing reagents and money from the Wnt research community. I boldly contacted leaders in the Wnt field and asked them to crowdsource contribute to this resource. Creating the library helped me get out there to the Wnt community. When you’re a young assistant professor, you need to network into a community of researchers. My CSBC collaborators and I think that there are highly dynamic forms of heterogeneity in tumors that are non-genetic, meaning they are not based on mutations. This non-genetic heterogeneity is very flexible and changes all the time. We think this dynamic form of nongenetic heterogeneity enables tumors to adapt to a rapidly changing environment, including the stresses that confront the tumor as it grows in the surrounding environment. The overarching goal of the project is to identify molecules and strategies that create patterns of heterogeneity in the system. We are also studying how those mechanisms influence tumor growth and their role in drug resistance. One of the biggest, most confounding problems in cancer research and the development of successful targeted therapeutics is the flexibility of cells. There’s flexibility in signaling networks, flexibility in metabolism, and flexibility in evasion of the immune system. Targeting one activity with a new drug can trigger compensatory changes in cancer cells that allow them to cope with that therapy and rewire their circuitry to survive. From my point of view, the flexibility and coping capabilities of tumors are grounded in heterogeneity, which is a pattern of cellular flexibility. I think this cellular flexibility tracks back to normal developmental processes and homeostatic mechanisms. My hope is that our studies will help define the origins and activities of the patterns of flexibility, which can lead to a smarter, more effective strategy for targeting colon cancer. An even larger hope would be that our studies will have relevance beyond colon cancer to be helpful for targeting other types of solid tumors. I like to create ceramics and carve into them. Right now, I’m doing the art of biology, where  carve in the scientific structures that I’m studying. I’ve carved colon crypts, stem cells, and neurons into my ceramic creations.

Then we turn to the practical matter of personal finances and taxes for graduate students and postdocs in a conversation with Dr. Emily Roberts of Personal Finances for PhDs. Apple Podcasts  Spotify Podcasts    Dr. Peng Jiang started his research program at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in July 2019. His Lab focuses on developing big-data and artificial intelligence frameworks to identify biomarkers and new therapeutic approaches for cancer immunotherapies in solid tumors. Before joining NCI, he finished his postdoctoral training at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard University. During his postdoctoral research, Peng developed computational frameworks that repurposed public domain data to identify biomarkers and regulators of cancer immunotherapy resistance. Notably, his computational model TIDE revealed that cancer cells could utilize the self-protection strategy of cytotoxic lymphocytes to resist lymphocyte killing under immune checkpoint blockade. Dr. Peng finished his Ph.D. at the Department of Computer Science & Lewis Sigler Genomics Institute at Princeton University, and his undergraduate study with the highest national honors at the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University (GPA rank 1st in his year). He is a recipient of the NCI K99 Pathway to Independence Award, the Scholar-In-Training Award of the American Association of Cancer Research, and the Technology Innovation Award of the Cancer Research Institute.  Dr. Emily Roberts is the owner of Personal Finance for PhDs. Her mission is to inspire and empower early-career PhDs to make the most of their money by engaging with graduate students and postdocs through Personal Finance for PhDs seminars, coaching, and websites, Personal Finance for PhDs and PhD Stipends. She launched Personal Finance for PhDs shortly after her PhD defense in fall 2014. She has been writing and teaching about personal finance since 2011. She started blogging about personal finance in 2011 (Evolving Personal Finance) and launched PhD Stipends and Grad Student Finances (the predecessor to Personal Finance for PhDs) in 2014. Dr. Roberts’ also volunteered for three years with Personal Finance @ Duke and a community-based personal finance class. She received a PhD in biomedical engineering from Duke University in 2014 and a BS in physics from Harvey Mudd College in 2007.

I'm your host Oliver Bogler. I work at the NCI in the Center for Cancer Training. On Inside Cancer Careers, we explore all the different ways that people join the fight against disease and hear their stories. Today, we're talking to Dr. Peng Jiang, a computational scientist in NCI's Center for Cancer Research who is focusing on using big data to understand how cancer can become resistant to immunotherapy and overcoming it. After the break, we are speaking to Dr. Emily Roberts of Personal Financial for PhDs. She joins us to talk about how to make things work financially during grad school and post-doc years. Then stay tuned to hear recommendations for interesting things from our guests and learn how you can take your turn. OLIVER: It's a pleasure to welcome Dr. Peng Jiang, a Stadtman Investigator in the NCI's Cancer Data Science Laboratory, where he leads the section on Computational Cancer Immunology to the show. Welcome. PENG JIANG: Yes, thank you, Oliver, for the introduction. OLIVER: It's a great time in the history of cancer research with the explosion of knowledge about many cancers leading to the development of a good number of new therapy approaches. But in many cases, resistance arises to these new therapies. And we're learning resistance itself may be mediated by many different mechanisms, so making it very hard to predict the response to a treatment and its durability. How can a computational scientist like yourself address this challenge? PENG: Yes, Oliver, this is a really great question. As you know, like for almost any type of an effective therapy, in most cases -- I will say for more than 70% of cases for any therapy resistance will eventually come one day. It's really a bottle neck for the entire field. And a unique angle from our data science is that we utilized the large amount of clinical data from patients. Realize that patients' data tells us what is going on under that resistance. Like, you know, the cause for resistance could be really complicated, right? Like one clinical trial, one cohort patient may only tell you part of the story, because it's so complicated. However, if you aggregate a lot of data sites from different centers, from different studies, and really look at the behavior of tumors with developing resistance, you know, really big data mining, you can see lots of like new mechanisms as a price. This is a unique advantage of data scientists because we can utilize the big data-driven approach to aggregate lots of resources from different publications from different centers to get a holistic overview of that resistance process, and then develop some hypothesis and gather some key experimental validation. So in short, like I think our data sciences are an advantage in this process is the big data, the size. OLIVER: So what kind of data are you analyzing, clinical data but also biological data of the tumors? PENG: Yes, yes. So like right now, tumor sequencing is becoming cheaper and cheaper so there are lots of RNA sequencing, whole exome sequencing to tell you RNA level somatic mutations, and also epigenetic sequencing to tell you the epigenetic modifications. So we analyze all kinds of sequencing data,  transcriptomic data from different studies paired with the patient’s clinical outcomes. OLIVER:  And you're focused on immunotherapy, which of course is a particularly exciting area right now. You've got check point blockades, you've got CAR-T cells now, personalized mRNA vaccines. PENG: Yes. OLIVER: What are the challenges of these approaches, and how does your work specifically address them? PENG: Yes, so first of all, immunotherapy is indeed a breakthrough, but remember for most current immunotherapies, for most solid tumor types more than two-third of the patients will not respond to the treatment. So basically for the majority of the patients still immunotherapy does not bring any help to them. And if you look at the rule of nature, any mechanism you develop in biology or in the human body, must have one or two counter-mechanisms to stop that. For any kind of mechanism, including immunological processes or any kind of other process. The same for immunology. Any anti-tumor or anti-pathogen pathogen immune response process must have two or even more of a counter-mechanisms to stop that through the evolution. It basically means that the tumors have so many options to go against any immunotherapy we deliver against them, right? Because nature through evolution, there are so many things to just come up. OLIVER: So, these counter-mechanisms they are normally -- in a healthy individual, they balance each other out to -- PENG: Yes. OLIVER: Prevent runaway processes. PENG: Exactly. And this is a later product of evolution, because -- right, because in evolution there is no single mechanism that can overcome all other mechanisms. There is always something that has to counter. OLIVER: So that really strikes me as incredibly complicated, the immune system is itself complicated. But then we also recognize that the tumor is really a complex community, almost a tissue in itself or an organ in itself, right, with all kinds of cellular components in it. PENG: Yes. OLIVER: How do you pull and tease that apart? PENG: Yes, you know, like the sequencing technologies nowadays are becoming so powerful, right, through like at least through whole exome sequencing you can see lots of mutations. RNA sequencing you can roughly infer what cell populations are in a tumor, and also like spatial sequencing is becoming more and more affordable. Right now you can even know the molecular spatial structure of like tumors, so which means our with the advance of our technologies understanding the tumor structure will become easier and easier. So I will say that eventually, we should be able to get a really reasonable view of the tumor structure and the underside of how the tumor counteracts against the immune response. OLIVER: How does the structural three-dimensional composition of the tumor, how will you learn from looking at that, how the immune activities are overcome or the resistance arises? PENG: Yes; you know, like the most conventional histopathology staining like H&E, a very conventional and commonly used approach, right? It just looks at texture, looks at morphology. You can infer what type of cells roughly through the cell morphology. This is pretty cheap, I would say, like several dollars for a tumor sample. And then if you want to know more of the sub-types of the cells in the tumor then multiplexing immunofluorescence of six or seven proteins are becoming more and more possible right now. And this could already tell you a lot. If there are some immunosuppressive cells what could they come from? What could be their lineage? Multiplexing immunofluorescence can already tell you a lot. And then here come new technologies, like spatial transcriptomics, coded spatial proteomics of 40 protein markers or maybe RNA sequencing on a genome scale. However, these technologies are still too expensive from a clinical application, right? But at least for research, they greatly help to reveal the structure of the tumor. OLIVER: So, help me understand how this knowledge will then allow you to support therapies or to avoid resistance or overcome resistance. PENG: Yes. OLIVER: I imagine these three-dimensional tumors, there are immune cells in there, there are tumor cells, there are all kinds of stromal cells. Now you have detailed transcriptomic, and mutational, and epigenetic information about all these different cells. How does that then transform into something that you can do in the clinic? PENG: So, like when a tumor is fighting a mechanism to go against, you know, immune-attack, typically, this mechanism will not happen all across the tumor. It will only happen at a certain region more frequently the border between the tumor and the immune cell section; because you only need like the soldiers to fight in the front line, right? So which means conventionally if you sequence the whole tumor, you will really dilute the signal of the key mechanism at the front line. This is why the current special technologies is very useful, because it can help you to pinpoint on the most critical region and have detailed resolution of what is going on molecularly there. OLIVER: am I right in thinking that you are actually trying to sort of see the resistance arising in that zone that you described - the interface? PENG: Yes - a very specific zone, and we really focus your sequencing power on the most important zone. OLIVER: Interesting. So, you're a computer engineer, computer scientist by training. I have two questions. How did you become interested in the work that you're doing today, and how as a computer scientist and computer engineer do you approach it? Do you approach it differently do you think than if you had trained as a biologist primarily? PENG: Yes. So, like initially when I came to the USA for graduate school study my major was computer graphics. Because Princeton University, my PhD school, has a terrific computer graphics program. But most programs -- most students who graduated from Princeton’s computer graphics program, they will join Pixar or like Snapchat, you know, like to make computer games, movies, more for entertainment. To be honest, I could be biased. I think, you know, depends on what is the utility of computer games for our young generation. And then at that time, one of my most respected people, my flute teacher died of a brain tumor. OLIVER: Hmm. PENG: I learned so much from him, both music and also being a good person, and you know, like I think kind of like my father kind of deal. OLIVER: Yes. PENG: And for such people, I deeply respect, just suddenly die of brain tumor within three months -- OLIVER: Wow. PENG: It's really a big shock for me. Because like three months before, I had seen him. He seems to me quite normal. But suddenly, he starts to respond very slowly if I ask him a question, and then, after 90 days, he died. OLIVER: Wow. PENG: Like this is a really deep shock to me because some people you really respect can leave you, right? Like in a short amount of time. OLIVER: Of course. PENG: And but you know, at that time, I just keep an open mind. A good thing about Princeton is it does give graduate students lots of flexibility so if you suddenly become interested in some other aspect; because the school gave you -- gave everyone really a safeguard financially. So you can -- you have some free time to explore around the graduate school. And then you know, after many years, I realized that the cancer research is not about starting off, it's not only about science, it's more about human emotion. If you want to do something to allow the people you love, the people you respect to have a better life or to at least live a few months longer -- OLIVER: Yes. PENG: To enjoy the company of family members. And gradually, I just found out that cancer research is a really mixture of enjoying scientific exploration, scientific endeavors, and also doing something to help our basic human emotions. So this is why, you know, I eventually decided to switch from computer graphics to like bioinformatics with some focus on cancer-related applications. OLIVER: I can see that it's a deeply motivating experience. And obviously, we're excited to have people with your skill set and expertise in the world of cancer. So you bring that computer engineering expertise -- PENG: Yes, but Oliver... OLIVER: Yes. PENG: I also mentioned one important thing here. I enjoy a lot in this process, but also I somehow not only me, I suffered a lot in this process; because to be honest, like if you look at the industry, the computer and IT industry in the US, and you know, other parts of the world are really booming a lot. OLIVER: Yes. PENG: Which means if I’d stayed in computer science, joined Pixar or joined those big IT companies. The pay is so high. The pay is just so high. You know what I mean, and -- OLIVER: Yes. PENG: To be honest, I think that it's much easier if you are getting high pay to stay computer science than going into biology and cancer research. And unfortunately, this is the truth. So like I will say that going this path compared to staying in computer science, it's not really kind of -- even if it's young people, from the financial point of view. And I'm still thinking about very hard of how to resolve this balance, this like, through some mechanism. But I think it's a major difficulty, especially at NCI, when we want to recruit computational post-docs, we are competing with Amazon close to us. They are paying something that is even comparable to my like boss, our bosses at NCI. OLIVER: Yes. PENG: So, then it's so hard to compete for talented young people to join our endeavor nowadays. So, I think this could call attention of our higher leadership or maybe people around us could think about some crazy solutions. OLIVER: Yes, thank you for bringing that up. I think that is a real challenge, because we need people with that talent, but we are competing with -- PENG: Yes. OLIVER: A very active private sector. PENG: Exactly. OLIVER: Yes. So as a computer scientist, how do you think your approach to the biological problem of cancer is perhaps different from that of someone like myself who trained as a biologist? PENG: Yes. This is really a personal viewpoint, in my just a personal case, I think a key difference is the way we develop hypotheses, right? Because fundamentally, biology is a hypothesis driven science. We need to find a hypothesis first. Like as computer scientists, we have a little bit of luxury to look at lots of data from human clinics and see clinically what are our biggest correlatives of our patients’ clinical outcomes, adverse events, through some more complicated like models what are potential regulators. So this means that, I think that we do have a big advantage about developing some more -- some better hypotheses through large -- through analyzing a larger amount of human genetic data. However, our disadvantage, our biggest disadvantage is because we are trained as computer scientists sometimes, we may not really know the biology deep enough, so we may focus on something, which may not be really useful at the very beginning. This is why personally, I started reading biology studies since the fourth year of my PhD studies. I spent years to catch up with biology knowledge. So I will say a computer scientist, if you want to do cancer research, should take a considerable amount of time to learn biology. Otherwise, we may put our focus on something not so useful. OLIVER: Yes, and you continued your journey after Princeton at Dana Farber in the Harvard School of Public Health, right? So -- PENG: Yes. OLIVER: Presumably, that -- you were steeped there in cancer biology. Why the Harvard School of Public Health? Did you do public health research? PENG: Oh, it's just a name issue because like the Dana Farber Cancer Institute is an affiliate of Harvard University. And our department is affiliated under the School of Public Health. OLIVER: Ah. PENG: But all other departments are affiliated under the medical school, but it's not really related to the public health. It's just an affiliation issue. OLIVER: I understand. So you focused there then on the kind of detailed molecular analysis of cancers that you're now combining with your computation? PENG: Yes. Yes. Yes. OLIVER: And you -- I believe you were using AI, of course, in your work as well, right? I mean, AI is exploding all around us even -- PENG: Yes. OLIVER: Non-computational people myself can't avoid noticing it these days. How are you using it? PENG: Yes; so like in biology, lots of data does not really have obvious dimensions, right? For example, for gene titres, it’s easy. – you can look at the readout of different genes. But for other data types, like histopathology images, or protein or spatial transcriptomic  what you get then is both the molecular marker and the spatial structure information. It's just impossible for human eyes to analyze those kinds of data. This is why you have to use AI to somehow model this data in a more dimensional space to analyze what is the differential feature. So like I will say that for unidimensional data and spatially structured data, that lots of new biology technologies are generating right now, AI is a tool you have to utilize. OLIVER: So, you received the K99/R00 award while you were a post-doc, right? PENG: Yes. OLIVER: And how did that impact your next step? You came to the NCI, obviously, so. PENG: Yes. Yes, so I gave up the K99 because if I want to join NCI, I have to give up the K99, right -- OLIVER: Yes. PENG: Like at NIH. I think the advantage is after I got the K99, lots of schools invited me to go for a faculty interview. So, you know, and also for like a free flight, and dinner, and talking with lots of people. It's really kind of an enjoyment, even though eventually I did not really use the K99. I do think the K99 did a really good thing indirectly. The main thing is that I got a lot of invited talks and publicized my research profile. Otherwise, as a young faculty or as young people, it should take some time for me to really get lots of invitations. OLIVER: Right. So you came to NCI. What made you decide that the NCI's Intramural Research Program was the right place for you? PENG: It's about people. I remember I met with my current boss Eytan Ruppin -- or I will say current mentors, like my Lab Chief, at the AACR conference in 2018. After talking with Eytan for ten minutes, I immediately decided that he is the one I want to work with. I want him to be my mentor and my boss in the future. So it's more about like the charisma and also the dynamic feeling when I talked with my current mentor, Eytan Ruppin, is the number one reason. The second reason is that I interviewed at NCI. I talked with so many people here. I really love my scientific discussions with NCI people and NIH people. The third reason, and also a very important reason, is the possibility of scientific research. If I stay in the medical school, I need to probably write grants all day long. How can I focus on research idea? But it's a little bit more time, right? So, for example, at Princeton, Andrew Wiles could spend a decade of years to focus on proving Fermat’s conjecture because he had financial stability and safety. The counterpart in biology, the only place I find this is NCI. So, this institute just gave me some safety so that I can take a risk and work on some long range things. Otherwise, you know, in other private institutions who are also very great. I cannot really probably afford to focus on some long-term projects without just keep writing grants. OLIVER: Yes, the NCI's -- or NIH's program, intramural program, is designed exactly for that, right? PENG: Yes. OLIVER: Longer-term --Higher-risk projects with less cycle. That's fantastic. So, what was it like to start your own research group? PENG: Yes, like to be honest, at the very beginning, it's not so much different from being a post-doc; like maybe I actually became a super post-doc doing the research by myself because at the very beginning I was just by myself. And then COVID-19 came, right? You know, it's very hard for me to recruit people, because for me, as a young PI, mostly I still recruit people from China; you know from my Chinese background. But then when the COVID hit with the travel ban, I cannot recruit people from China, so just by myself still as a single post-doc. And gradually, I have a post-doc and one student, so I mentored them, but, you know, I still need to do quite a portion of the programming work by myself, but also mentor them to somehow do the work together, basically. It's not really like my post-doc mentor. She can somehow more depend on us to closely work with my usual trainees. They are my colleagues, my bench mate, you know, this kind of work. And until recently, like after the COVID is gone, I can kind of get more people in the lab. Then gradually my focus switched from programming and working like a close -- like a colleague more to the mentor and maybe manager, actually how to manage people; but this only happened recently. OLIVER: Yes, and then you were recruited as part of the Stadtman program. PENG: Yes. OLIVER: What is that program? PENG: Yes, this program is -- like I guess, you know, like it's like an NIH institution-wide kind of umbrella program to -- recruit promising young faculties, give a kind of a guarantee of research resources, making sure we can totally focus on scientific research without worrying about the money issue. So, like basically I think this is a really unique setting, at least, of what I could find in the US that could really give young people total scientific budget safety to focus on some long-term things, even from the very beginning. OLIVER: So, help us understand what the next months or years for your research program look like. What are you excited about? PENG: Yes, so currently I'm really excited about using big data approach to find new secreted proteins underlying cancer immunotherapy resistance. Because like recently like we have collected lots of human clinical data from different clinical trials that other people published, and also from our collaborators. And we mathematically examined this large body of human clinical outcome data from cancer immunotherapy trials. We really found out that a group of secreted proteins with really less-known functions are really top indicators of either bad or good immunotherapy outcome. And also traditionally, secretion proteins studies is a blind spot for a genetic screening approach; because genetic screening cannot study secretion proteins. All neighbor cells are still sending other signals. So mutagenesis on one cell will tell you nothing in the microenvironment. In fact, this is why I was so excited about this blind spot of traditional genetics approach, but really gave a computational data driven approach some unique advantage. So currently, we are doing data integration, computational modeling and also mouse models to study the -- to identify new secreted proteins driving the cancer immunotherapy response. And we have some -- quite promising initial results; found of some new secreted proteins that are -- have really unknown functions but that really have a dramatic effect in driving cancer immunotherapy results. OLIVER: So those proteins might be points of future intervention. PENG: Yes, because any secreted proteins could be a drug by itself, based on kind of engineering, right? OLIVER: Interesting. PENG: Yes. OLIVER: What's the advice you're giving to early career scientists, maybe even computation scientists like yourself who might be interested in cancer? What advice are you giving them? PENG: Yes, maybe my advice is more specific to computational scientists. Like the first advice, only do science if you are really enthusiastic about it. Otherwise, for computational scientists, just don't do it. Most of the time, you will probably -- for people who are not really sure about science, what you'll end up is that they do maybe one or two years science research then just go to industry. Because for the industry market is booming so much. So I think that otherwise, you know, like one or two years, then why bother just to do that at the very beginning, right, and also for the PIs it’s unfair to waste the PI’s one or two years of funding and then see the postdoc just leave to industry. And then if you are really enthusiastic about science and you really want to use your knowledge to change people's life, to make sure that your beloved people, or other people’s beloved people who have a few more months of survival time to enjoy family time, or eventually have the disease cured. But if this is your inner drive, then do cancer research with your computational expertise. But for people who don't really have this inner drive to serve for the human beings, the emotion, like I didn't consider about it -- maybe like the industry sector is a really good option. And then, you know, like for people who decide to do the research, my second advice is just to slow down; you know, like don't be too eager to publish or gather papers or scientific publications. Scientific research is not easy. Ninety-nine percent we are getting failures or imperfect results. You really need to slow down to somehow have a kind of a smooth mood-- to somehow enjoy the process of doing scientific research with your colleagues. And then under this mode maybe it's even quicker in the long run to get a good research work published and then establish your signature work in the field. OLIVER: Well, thank you so much for telling us about your work and your story, and sharing this advice with us. Thank you. PENG: Yes, thank you, Oliver. [UPBEAT MUSIC] OLIVER: The NCI recently launched a new online seminar series. Here to tell us more is Nas Zahir, Director of the Cancer Training Branch. NAS ZAHIR: Yes, we launched the NCI Rising Scholars Cancer Research Seminar Series in January to highlight the research and contributions made by NCI-supported postdoctoral fellows, and early career investigators at NCI laboratories and NCI-funded institutions nationwide. The talks are every month on the third Thursday, and you can see them and register for them on the NCI website. There will be a link in the show notes, or you can search for “NCI Rising Scholars”. OLIVER: That sounds great! What kind of topics are the speakers covering? NAS: We have a broad range of topics – pretty much any kind of cancer research. We have had basic science topics, clinical research, health disparities, cancer prevention, immunology, and many more. Each talk is related to a recent publication by the presenter and there is plenty of time for Q&A. OLIVER: What if you missed a talk? NAS: We post a recording of the presentation a few days after the talk, along with a transcript and captions so you can always catch the talks at your convenience. OLIVER: Thanks, Nas –check out NCI’s Rising Scholars seminar series if you are interested in some great research that’s increasing knowledge right now. It's a pleasure to welcome Dr. Emily Roberts. Dr. Roberts obtained her doctorate in biomedical engineering from Duke University in 2014, but now she's focused on providing financial advice to early career scientists. Welcome. EMILY ROBERTS: Thank you so much for having me. It's great to be with you. OLIVER: Emily, I'm interested. How did you first get the science bug? EMILY: I -- tough one. So I remember when I was in, let's say, middle school even into high school, I always was a good academic performer, across a lot of subject areas. So I was, you know, on an advanced math track for example, probably like many of your listeners, but I also really loved reading and writing and so forth, and I had the opportunity in high school to attend a magnet high school that was science and technology focused, and I remember that was actually a tough decision for me. I mean, I ended up going there, but my alternative if I hadn't gone there was an international baccalaureate program at my base high school, and so I was like, oh, torn between these two worlds, you know? But I decided to go kind of the science and tech track, and it was in high school that I fell in love with physics, which is what I ended up majoring in, in college, and so it was really, I think, during high school, sort of, I got, you know, a little bit pushed in that direction by the environment that I was in, and I really loved astronomy and astrophysics, and so forth. And I actually decided to go to Harvey Mudd College for my undergraduate degree, which if your listeners are not familiar with it, its tagline is the liberal arts college of engineering. So it's a liberal arts education, but the only majors that are offered are engineering and sciences. And so I thought that was a great balance for me of like, still being able to have like, these different elements in my life, still being able to pursue some humanities studies, social sciences, and so forth, as well as being able to major in physics at an excellent institution. So yeah, that's kind of -- I've always had sort of a foot or an interest in all kinds of different academic subject areas. OLIVER BOGLER: Interesting, and then you chose biomedical engineering for your PhD. EMILY ROBERTS: Yeah, so this might speak to like, I've never settled in one area for very long. So yes, I did physics in my undergraduate. And I liked biology, but I hadn't had a really good biology background in high school, and so it wasn't till I got to college, that I got more biology classes and decided oh, I'm really interested in this too, and so I kind of shifted from physics to biophysics, and then into biomedical engineering. And honestly, I actually ended up picking biomedical engineering. I was very torn again. My passion would have been to study astrobiology for my graduate degree, not an area I know a ton about, but I was reading books about it. I tried to take some courses at the undergraduate level. And I was just oh, this is my passion. But I was also very practical, and I realized that it would be difficult to get funding in that area, and it'd be difficult -- you know, the career options are very limited, and so I ended up choosing biomedical engineering, which I was also very interested in, but because the career prospects on the other side of that degree were much more solid. And yeah, so I don't necessarily like, you know, regret doing my PhD or whatever, but there's always that path not taken of like the subject matter I didn't end up studying. OLIVER BOGLER: Yeah, for sure. I mean, there's so many areas of interest. It's always difficult to choose. But then I understand that you chose not to stay in science primarily, but you pivoted to a new career. Tell us about that, and how did that happen? EMILY ROBERTS: Yeah, absolutely. I -- well, I should mention that in between my undergraduate and graduate degrees, I did a one-year postdoc fellowship at the NIH -- OLIVER BOGLER: Oh. EMILY ROBERTS: I was in IRTA for a year. OLIVER BOGLER: Okay. EMILY ROBERTS: Great experience. And then when I started graduate school, like I'm sure so many others, I was very optimistic, wide-eyed, and a couple of years into that, I was getting pretty burned out on the research track, was not enjoying myself as much as I had been in the earlier years, and I did a big kind of career reevaluation sort of in my third year, I would say, of my PhD, and was really trying to decide, should I just leave with a master's? Should I finish? What are my career options? What am I really wanting to pursue here? And I decided that I did have a few career options I was quite interested in that were -- you know, it depends on what term you use, right, alternative careers, outside of academia, these kinds of things. I knew I didn't want to stay in academia, but there were some things I was interested in, in terms of other careers that still required the PhD or the PhD would be very useful as a credential, and so I decided to finish the PhD kind of for that reason. And then, as we'll talk about in a minute, ended up pivoting completely in my subject matter again, but I still find the PhD credential and experience that I had to be very useful in my current career, even though I'm not using my specific research area. OLIVER BOGLER: Yeah, no, for sure. I mean, the PhD, you learn a lot about how to research things in depth, how to assemble information, study data, and all those kinds of things. I'd like to go -- dig a little deeper in what you just told us. So, you spent some time kind of doing a survey of what you could do in your career. How did you tackle that? EMILY ROBERTS: So, I was really, really fortunate that the university I attended (Duke) has a really robust support area in terms of professional development and career services and so forth. I don't actually know right now, but it did at that time, and I think it was really kind of one of the forerunners in providing those kinds of services to the PhD population, not just, you know, the undergraduates and the master's students and so forth. So, I really utilized the services and the exercises and the programs that they were offering. Like, I was one of those, like frequent fliers, you know, at those, like professional development events. So, I did that a lot in about my third year of graduate school, and I, you know, did like the strengths inventory and did those tests and all these things, and was just trying to figure out what I wanted. I did identify, as I said, a few careers that I was interested in. The main one that I actually worked in for a tiny bit after my PhD, was science policy. OLIVER BOGLER: Interesting, so I think you're referring to the Strength Finders methodology, which kind of takes a look at your abilities and interests and tries to match you to domains of work, I guess, is one way of putting it. Interesting. So, I think a lot of our listeners probably have similar resources on their -- at their institutions, and I guess engaging with them is a good thing. All right, so where did you end up, and why specifically there? EMILY ROBERTS: Yes. Okay, so now we have to go back again to this period of time, right after I finished undergrad, when I was doing my postbac and then when I started graduate school. So, I -- no shade to my parents, but I was never really explicitly taught anything about money. And when I was growing up, I mean, we all absorb things about money from our environments, you know, the attitudes and so forth about it, but they were not overtly teaching me anything like about budgeting or credit cards or retirement accounts or any of those kinds of things. And so once I graduated from college and I started this post-bac, I knew I was going to be receiving a stipend. If I remember correctly, was about $24,000 a year. This was like 2007, and I was living, you know, right outside DC. And so this, I knew, because I'm actually from the DC area from the Virginia side, I knew that this is a high-cost of living area, and that $24,000 per year was going to be challenging, and so I sort of started to undertake a self-study in personal finance just to figure out, well, how am I going to survive on this level of income in this certain, you know, cost of living area? And then further than that, like, how do I thrive? Like, what are the adulting things that I am supposed to be doing with my money? And can I manage to do any of those things as a post-bac fellow, and then as a graduate student? So, what started off in around 2007, 2008, as like reading books about personal finance turned into -- if you remember this time period, we're into the Great Recession --, into like reading blogs about personal finance. There was a huge boom in the personal finance blogosphere, and so I was consuming a lot of that content. And then about midway through graduate school, I realized that nobody was like -- not nobody, but there was very little content in terms of these blogs that were being produced about the graduate student experience, like graduate student on stipend experience in terms of the finances. And so I started blogging about my own finances, and in that, was also from time to time discussing kind of grad student-specific issues, like, can I use a Roth IRA, or like what's going on with my taxes? And like these sort of weird technical things, and I realized after a few years of doing this sort of toward the end of graduate school, that I was looking at, you know, the search traffic that my blog got (I had a very small blog) but like the search traffic that it would get, these posts that I was writing about grad student-specific issues were getting all this search traffic in comparison to my other stuff, and I was like, oh, wow, like this content is needed, and there's not really anyone like teaching or talking about this, at least at a national level. And so that was one of the early clues for me that I was interested in this area, but also that it was an area of need among my peer group. OLIVER: So how did that need manifest? What information were your early readers of your blog looking for? EMILY: Yeah, as I said, my post, I think it was titled: “The bane of the graduate student's Roth IRA”. That was definitely the top post that was getting traffic on that particular blog. So, at that time, you could not contribute non-W2 fellowship income to an IRA that was not considered taxable compensation. That law has since changed, but this was an area that was not well understood, and a lot of people were contributing to IRAs without realizing that they didn't have the proper income to be able to do so. And so my, you know, writing about that and just reading the text and like interpreting what the tax code is saying was helpful to them in understanding, you know, maybe if their brokerage firm or, you know, the IRS sent something back that said, "Oh, actually this is not proper. You can't do this," whenever, they found some information, and then I was hoping to kind of explain and interpret that to them. So that crossover, actually, of like investing and taxes, those are like my two favorite personal finance subject areas, so I actually love that it was the crossover point between those two. OLIVER: Yeah, you clearly have a passion for this stuff. So just to be the acronym police, IRA is? EMILY: Ah, Individual Retirement Arrangement. So, an IRA is the type of tax-advantaged retirement account that you can open independent of your workplace. So like your workplace might offer -- well, not as a graduate student, but later on it might offer a 401(k) or 403(b) or a 457. We've probably all heard these kinds of acronyms floating around. But the one that you can get that's independent that does not depend on your university or your employer or whatever is the IRA, the Individual Retirement Arrangement. OLIVER: And the Roth is a subtype of that, correct? EMILY: Yes, there's two flavors of IRAs, the traditional (the type that came first) and the Roth, and without necessarily going into details, the Roth is generally preferred by people with lower incomes, like graduate students and postdocs. OLIVER: Yeah, I'm not asking you to give tax advice here on the podcast, but just trying to make sure our listeners sort of understand what you're sharing with them. So okay, so you had this experience. You were -- let me get this right -- you were still in graduate school, but you were developing this interest and passion, and you were blogging about that, is that correct? EMILY: That's correct. I started my first blog in about 2011. That's about midway through my PhD. The other thing that happened that sort of made me realize that this information was needed actually is a good faith effort that was undertaken by Duke, which is that they had put on some seminars. One was maybe about investing. There were a couple on taxes. I actually, ultimately, as through a volunteer position, became involved in like setting up these kinds of events with like, local, you know, CPAs and like Wealth Advisors, and so forth, but what I was realizing is that despite our best efforts from the university side, bringing in these licensed, credentialed very capable professionals to do these kinds of teaching events was not a great fit, because the clients that they typically served were totally out of step with the current reality of the graduate students and postdocs that they were speaking to. And so they, you know, maybe like on the tax side, they might be accustomed to preparing the tax returns of, you know, high-income earning parents of college students, and so then they think they know something about grad student taxes, which are kind of a whole different beast, so they knew a little bit, but not quite enough to make the material tailored and fit the best for that particular audience. On the investment side, they were talking about 401(k)s and I was like, "Um, like, I have a Roth IRA over here. Like, what do I do with that?" You know, so I just realized that, you know, because of the client mismatch, those were not the best kinds of people to be teaching this material. And, frankly, someone from their own peer group (me) with that self-knowledge and that, you know, reading and so forth I was doing was quite capable of teaching this material. OLIVER: So, a real gap, I guess, in what was being offered and what was being talked about, despite Duke's best efforts here. EMILY: Yeah, and again, like, I want to commend Duke for even trying to do anything in that area, because so many universities don't and didn't at that time, but, you know, I could do a little better, and so actually, I again, like thank you, them, for giving me the opportunity to give my first speaking engagement on this subject, which was after I defended, I was sticking around Durham because my husband, who also defended at the same time was transitioning to a postdoc position in his same PhD advisor's lab, but my advisor had left the university and I was like, "Whoops, I don't have a job anymore." And so I was kind of kicking around, not sure what I was doing and, you know, looking for some work opportunities, and in that time, I was like, hey, why don't I just like, develop a seminar on everything I think a graduate student, you know, on a stipend needs know about personal finance? And I gave that as a, you know, a volunteer thing through the group that I had been working with for a couple of years there at Duke, and I just loved it. Like I had so much fun developing the material, delivering the engagement, answering people's questions, and I was like, how do I make that my job? Like, that was so much fun, and so that was kind of what launched the business, Personal Finance for PhDs out of, you know, the sort of side hustle hobby-type of pursuits that I had been doing earlier. OLIVER: Yeah, so you had a really good chance to kind of market test what you were offering, but I would guess that it would have still taken some courage to take that leap into, okay, I'm now going to start my own consulting business, if that's the right way to put it. Is that true? Did you feel courageous or was it -- did it just seem obvious to you? EMILY: Mm, so I am not really a risk taker, so this was a big risk to be doing with my career. And so there are a couple of things that contributed to me being able to take that risk at that time. By the way, I don't call what I do consulting or advice giving. OLIVER: Oh. EMILY: I call it financial education -- OLIVER: Okay. EMILY: -- because I don't have a CPA. I'm not a CFP. No, it's totally fine. Like, everybody gets confused about this, so I just wanted to -- people are always like, "Oh, you're a consultant, right?" I'm like, well, the business is similar to a consultancy, but what I do is not consulting. OLIVER: Got it. EMILY: So anyway. But yes, there were of couple things at that time. So one was that, as I mentioned, my husband had a job, and we had joint finances and so, you know, while not lovely living, you know, two people on a postdoc salary, it was okay, and I was also -- I had a side hustle. Like, I was bringing in some degree of income, right? And so that was okay, at that time for a little while because the other part of this picture is that my husband and I, we got married about halfway through graduate school. We were both kind of aligned on this, and so we were both working on our personal finances. I mentioned earlier, I was doing a lot of learning about it, but I was also doing a lot of application, right, you know, saving up the emergency fund, starting to use investments like in Roth IRAs, so forth, these kinds of things, paying off debt. And so because we had been doing that for this seven years, right, between when we both graduated from college in 2007, and then, you know, 2014, we had quite a decent nest egg built up by that time. And so that gave us both some confidence that it was okay to take some risk in our careers that we might not have been able to do had we not had that kind of financial safety net in place. So not only did I eventually start my business, which certainly at first did not earn what I would have been earning if I had gotten a standard-type job, but my husband, also not a career risk taker, but he was able to go to a startup. That actually was a really, really great fit for his PhD work, and he would not have considered a job like that if we didn't have that financial security that we had generated, you know, on our personal balance sheets, because we obviously, were not necessarily thinking it was going to come from our, in my case, myself, my own employer. In his case, a, you know, 12-person company that he went to in I guess it would have been like about 2015. OLIVER: Interesting. So now, we're almost 10 years later, and you've obviously not only continued in this work, but expanded it significantly is my understanding, so what is the state of your activities now? EMILY: It's so varied. I'm really grateful that so at the beginning, I was sort of billing myself as like, a professional public speaker on this topic of personal finance for this particular audience of graduate students and postdocs. And that has remained something that I continue to do, but now and, you know, things change with the pandemic, obviously. I was traveling, you know, some before then, and then that was not an option anymore, so the business has had to shift a bit over time. So I've added a lot of different types of offerings. Right now, what I'm really excited about, so I still do the live speaking, you know, whether it's webinars, in person, but what I'm really excited about now is more of like a flipped classroom-type model of content that I've developed. So I pre-recorded a lot of the various areas that I teach, chiefly taxes, but also in some other areas, and so what I do, I'll just give an example for the tax workshops that I offer during tax season, which we're recording this in April, so it just ended. It's heavy on my mind. So I pre-record all this teaching about how to generate your tax return correctly as a graduate student or postdoc. This year, I actually expanded to offering it to nonresidents as well as US citizens and residents. So I pre-record all these videos, I give the slides, I give the text. It's like maybe two hours of content, something like that, if you were to watch it straight through, also worksheets to help people keep things straight. So they have all this pre-recorded content. I like this because they can access it at any point during tax season, right? Like some people want to file in January. Some people want to file in April. And then I pair that with periodic live Q&A sessions. So I really love this because I get to spend my time creating the teaching material, like creating the slide deck, writing the script, doing it once or, you know, doing it well. And then I just get to answer people's questions as like the thing that I show up live for, which is so much more fun and exciting to me than presenting, you know, the same material over and over again. I get to present it once, as I said, do it right, and then just answer people's questions. I love that interaction with people as like part of my job, answering questions, hearing stories from them, hearing how the material has helped them or, you know, what area they're moving into next. So I have that for the tax area of my business, but also several other areas, and so that's what I'm really excited about. It's just like, me getting more face time, like, answering people's questions instead of just people listening to me talk live. OLIVER: Makes sense. What's the business model? EMILY: I don't know. That's one thing about solopreneurship that is so fun is like you don't have to write a business plan at the beginning of this. You just kind of feel out how it goes, but yeah, I -- OLIVER: Are people paying a subscription to your content, or? EMILY: Okay, so my main revenue comes from universities. OLIVER: Ah, okay. EMILY: So, I really love it when I can get this material in front of graduate students and postdocs without them having to pay for it, so I really want the universities ideally to pay for it on their behalf and offer it as like a free benefit. That's not always possible, and so I do have for example for the tax workshops I just mentioned, there is a way for individuals to purchase those through my website, but the vast majority of the revenue comes from the university clients. OLIVER: And I think you mentioned that you had given this presentation or this workshop at the NIH this past year, is that correct? EMILY: Yeah, so NIH was a new client this year. Thank you so much to the Office of Intramural Training and Education. Yeah, so this tax season, so again, we're in April 2023, so for the 2022 tax year, OITE offered all four versions of my tax return workshop, so one for post-bacs, one for grad students, one for postdocs, all US citizens or residents, and then one for nonresidents, all those groups together, and so it was awesome to have them as a first-time client this year. I was so glad to be able to work with them. OLIVER: That is fantastic. I know it's something that our post-bacs, postdocs and grad students continues to ask for is help us with taxes, so it's great that that happened. So sort of taking a slight pivot, you speak to a lot of folks in their early careers. What are the biggest challenges that grad students, postdocs, are facing at the moment in 2023, in terms of the financial issues? EMILY: Hm, it's got to be income versus cost of living, no question. I mean, we've seen this, you know, I don't want to say unprecedented, that's not the right word, but not precedented in a long-time degree of inflation going on in our, you know, economy generally, and that has really obviously squeezed people's budgets. And these stipends, and salaries have not -- you know, some of them have budged, but not enough of them and not enough movement, right, to really keep up with all of the levels of inflation, so again, like great job to those universities and institutes and programs and so forth that have significantly raised the stipends and salaries, but it needs to be more across the board for sure. So, I would say, income is the main challenge. OLIVER: So, you described a moment ago about your own journey, and that, together with your husband, how you focused a lot of your energy on improving your own financial health with I'm going to characterize it as just disciplined measures of paying down debt and savings and things like that. Is that an area you also offer advice into to grad students and postdocs? EMILY: For sure. So, it's interesting for me, like when I have to think about speaking engagements that I do, I have to serve two groups of people, right? I have to serve the people who are paying for me to be there, which is the universities, the clients, and I have to serve the people in the audience, the graduate students and the postdocs. And so I'm probably not talking enough about fixing the income side of the equation as I would like to be, in those settings. So tune in to my podcast, Personal Finance for PhDs, if you want to hear more about, you know, the income side of the equation, because in those settings, I do talk more about the financial management side of things. So for sure, you know, we talk about budgeting. I have like a really budgeting sort of tactic that I used when I was in graduate school that I found really helpful that my audiences are always asking, like, follow-up questions about. They're so interested in it when I teach it. But also, yes, the debt management, the saving, the emergency funds, and just cashflows, how to use credit cards, like all those kinds of things, for sure, but I really find that, okay, let's set aside the income problem, which is a major, major problem right now, especially. I do find that my audiences are quite interested in the topic of taxes (I already talked about that so much) and investing, again, my two favorite topics. So even though maybe a graduate student or a postdoc, you know, some of them are ready to start investing while they're in graduate school, but even if they're not ready, they're still quite interested in learning because they know when they get to that, you know, post-PhD post-postdoc career job, that they -- that investing is going to be part of their lives. They're savvy enough that they already realize they're going to be starting that as soon as possible, because they feel this pressure of having lost, you know, sometime during their PhD training. So, of course, if you can get started investing now, that's awesome, but if you can't right now, then, you know, there's some steps you can take to be ready to do so once you have the income to support it. So I love talking about that area. And the audiences are quite interested in there, yeah. OLIVER: Yeah, I mean, investment is -- it's very time driven, so the earlier you start, the better you start, and but I'm guessing your observation is that no matter how financially disciplined someone is, right now the just the income is not sufficient in most parts of the United States, I would guess. EMILY: It's so hard to generalize here, you know, because we hear so many anecdotes, and I would love to have more data around this. I actually have a database website called PhDstipends.com that people can go to report their -- you know, what they're earning in their graduate positions. There's also a sister website postdocsalaries.com for the postdoc, you know, population. So, you can get some idea of what people are being paid and compare those to, you know, your local cost of living kind of things, but that's not like a scientifically generated, you know, survey group, so I would love to see more studies around this, because certainly, some people are dramatically underpaid. They're in very precarious positions in graduate school or in their postdocs, whether that's because the income is too low, whether it's because, you know, they have academic-year-only income but not summer income, or maybe they have only guaranteed income for five years, but the degree is going to take seven, all kinds of different reasons that this can happen. Yet, there are others who think that they're being paid fine, well enough, that they might, you know, want to do things like investing and paying down debt while they're in graduate school, and of course, a lot of people in the middle who are kind of making it, they're not too stressed, but they're certainly not able to reach any financial goals, and so it's really a kind of a heterogeneous group. And so on my podcast, for example, kind of because I -- people volunteer to come on. So generally speaking, people volunteer to be interviewed who are doing pretty okay with their finances, because they feel good about talking about it, and so I have a lot of like, success stories on the podcast, but those are not representative of what's going on generally with the entire, you know, PhD population, and so, like I said, it's just really heterogeneous. And of course, I'm only talking about the income versus cost-of-living side of things right now. There’re also different family situations, right? So, some people may have dependents to support whether those are children, whether that is, you know, an aging parent, whether they're sending, you know, remittent -- is that the right word -- remittances back to their home countries to support, you know, someone there. So, like, you know, we kind of maybe assume like an avatar of a graduate student who's like a single young person, but that's definitely not everybody, and some people have other financial responsibilities. And so, yeah, it's, it's kind of all over the map, but I would really, really love to see those people who are being paid the least brought up out of this really poverty-level, you know, income, that they have to be able to have more financial security, because, frankly, how can we be expected to perform well and succeed with our research, with finishing our degrees with, you know, publishing the papers, when we're not receiving sufficient financial support? You know, when you have that stress of money on your mind, how can you be expected to perform well? And so it's really, I think, in the best interest of the universities to support people better, because they're going to get better work out of them in the meantime, and it's also the humane thing to do. Yeah. OLIVER: Yeah. Thank you very much for that feedback. You've mentioned the podcast a couple of times. So, you're in your 14th season. That's impressive. EMILY: Not 14 years, just 14 seasons -- OLIVER: Sure. EMILY: -- because we do about three per year. OLIVER: Three seasons per year. But give us a sort of overview of what kind of topics. You've mentioned you have guests come on -- coming on and who talk about their own financial journeys. What else do you cover in the podcast? EMILY: The vast majority of the episodes are interviews with, as I said, volunteers. So hey, if you're a podcast lover, you know, come on my podcast and talk about your finances. So that could be talking about like the overall financial journey that they've had, let's say entirely through graduate school, or it could be on more specific topics. Like I recently had a fantastic interview be published from a first-year graduate student who talked about, you know, how she selected the graduate schools that she was going to apply to partially based on the stipends that they offered, how she, you know, valuated those offers. So it's sort of talking about, like the process of getting into graduate school. Other times, I'll have kind of like professionals on, so I've interviewed a few, for instance, financial planners, people who do legally give advice on these kinds of things. So I've had some financial planners on. If they, you know, focus on academics or on PhDs as part of their like core client population, they talk about how those clients are similar or dissimilar from general financial planning clients that they might have. And then from time to time, I also do solo episodes where there's a certain area that I really want to teach on for free for everybody. They don't have to come to one of my seminars, just listen to the podcast. So, you know, I mentioned earlier, for example, there was a law change that allowed fellowship income not reported on W2s to be considered taxable compensation and contributed to an individual retirement arrangement, and so when that -- when the Secure Act passed, and that was one of the changes that happened with that law I devoted an episode, for example, to explaining what was going on with that. So from time to time, there'll be me teaching on things. I teach about taxes sometimes, so yeah, it's a little bit of a mix, but as I said, mostly volunteer driven, so I'm really always pleased when people decide to come on and open up this part of their, you know, this part of their lives that's kind of taboo to talk about still. OLIVER: Yeah, no, I think that's fantastic, and that's a great way to learn is from hearing other people's experiences and stories, so that's fantastic. Two questions I have to finish up with, so since you provide your services primarily through universities, if we have someone listening who cannot access your expertise and your teaching through their institution, how can they advocate for their dean or, you know, to consider engaging you? EMILY: Hm, thank you so much for asking that. Let's see. Mostly my university hosts are in like, professional development kind of areas, so that'd be the right kind of person to work with, usually at the graduate school level. I work with a lot of graduate schools or medical schools, not so much with -- I should say medical schools that offer PhDs -- not so much with like individual departments, although that does happen sometimes. So one kind of person to approach would be like a professional development-type person. It's always great when you have a group of people, not just a single person, say, hey, we really want to learn more about this and, you know, here's a particular resource, that would be me. Thank you very much. And so, you know, offering that to that person, as a group or individually from separate people would be great. Another great group to approach is the Graduate Student Governments or Graduate Student Association. Sometimes they don't have a great deal of discretionary funding, but if they do, then they could be able to host an event with me or like, you know, purchase a set of tax workshops, for example. So I have a lot of clients from the student-driven side of things as well. And then kind of same thing on the postdoc side, right? Like the postdoc offices or the postdoc associations are great people to approach about that, but yeah, I would say just, you know, request it. Send them my website. I have pages on there that explain kind of the different speaking things that I offer, the different workshops, yeah. OLIVER: Fantastic. I'm not going to ask you to give financial advice, because that's your day job, but I do want another kind of advice, wonder if you'd be willing to give it. So coming -- pivoting back to the career question, you were in graduate school. You took a turn to a very interesting and compelling area that you're very passionate about. What's your advice to our listeners who are maybe themselves in graduate schools or early in postdoc and they’re, you know, thinking about what else they could be doing? What's your advice to them? EMILY: Yes, the advice is, try things. Don't get so overly spending too much time at the bench or at your primary research area. Of course, you want to put in sufficient time. You want to do your 40 hours, 45, whatever it is, but don't get so carried away with that, that you forget that there are other areas of your life that need to flourish as well, and one of those is preparing for your future career, which is -- could be in research, but is frankly very unlikely to be in academia, at least in the long term, and so I would just say try things. So like, for me, my example, what I was trying was blogging, and that gave me some feedback. I mean, I wasn't making money from that, but it was giving me some feedback about what other people, you know, wanted and needed. And so some of the things you can try is like, you know, getting an internship. It doesn't have to be like an official, you know, summer internship you do full time, although that is possible in many fields. It could be a part-time internship that you do, you know, a few hours a week. It could be freelancing on the side. I'm mentioning things that you're probably going to get paid to do, but it's certainly okay to do volunteer work as well to just -- yeah, just get some experience outside of the academy. See how workplaces operate. See what people are interested in outside of your immediate context of, you know, your lab or the research that you're doing. So yeah, just try some things and do it all through your PhD, all through your postdoc. Don't leave this for just the last year when you're trying to transition out. OLIVER: Emily, thank you so much for all your advice and all that you do for our biomedical early career scientists. EMILY: Well, thank you so much for having me. It was really a pleasure to be here and thank you so much for giving me the opportunity. OLIVER: Now it's time for a segment we call "Your Turn", because it's a chance for our listeners to send in a recommendation that they would like to share. If you're listening, then you're invited to take your turn. Send us a tip for a book, a video, a podcast, or a talk, or anything that you found inspirational, or amusing, or interesting. You can send these to us at nciicc@nih.gov. If you record a voice memo and send it along, we may just play it on an upcoming episode. Now, I'd like to invite our guests to take their turn. Let's start with you, Dr. Jiang. PENG: Yes. Yes, so my favorite book is a book called "Life is About Giving Up". OLIVER: Okay. PENG: It's a book written by a very famous like Buddhist or monk in China called "The Master Nebula” like, you know, this a book that is a book about having the importance of learning to give up in your life. Like because for managing the important things in your life, if you want to achieve more, you need to give up a lot at the very beginning. However, the most important thing is to decide when to give up and when not to give up. This is a very hard thing in life. Like so this whole book is about how to adjust your expectation for life, how to accept failures, and give up smartly to avoid basically more resource in your life. And eventually like I think this -- after reading this book, I've become much happier instead of lots of false pretense. And I think that those -- like actually giving up will only somehow make your life much better and maybe even more in the long run. So this is why I recommend this book, it's about life is giving up. OLIVER: Thank you very much. That sounds like a really good read. Appreciate it. PENG: Yes. OLIVER: And how about your recommendation Emily, Dr. Roberts? EMILY: My recommendation is a book I read in about the past year that really shook me and it's kind of a personal finance book but it's kind of a life book and it's called "Die With Zero", the author is Bill Perkins. And one of the main concepts that he teaches is that as you exit different phases of your life, the ‘you’ that existed in that phase dies, so we have a high school you, that person is dead and gone, we have a college you, that person is dead and gone, the grad school you, et cetera, et cetera. So, the basic idea behind this is to encourage you to have experiences in the phase of life that you're in and not either, you know, put them off too much for the future or think that they're, you know, just basically match the experiences that you want to have to the phase of life that you're in. And so now that I'm like, you know, I have a couple of kids, like I'm in a certain phase of life right now, I'm in the little kid phase of life and the grad school me is gone. And so there are some things I wish I had done during graduate school, some opportunities I wish I'd taken and some I'm really glad that I took. And so just realize that you are, whatever phase you're in right now, it's a special phase of life, it's not going to be around forever and please do, you know, pursue the opportunities that you have that are unique to that phase while you have the chance to do so. OLIVER: That's a great recommendation, good advice. Thank you very much. And I'd like to make a recommendation as well. It's for the stand-up comic Tig Notaro and specifically her set from about 8 years ago when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. This original set is just remarkable and its candor and in her descriptions of the experience of receiving a diagnosis, just her ability to digest this very difficult time in her life and see the humor in it and bring it to an audience. We'll post a link to the recording and actually since then she's continued to shed light on this topic and related issues. She's pursued her goals in life and she shares much of her journey in documentaries and on social media and YouTube and other places, so you can find all that online. I have to say I find her work always helps me regain perspective and strength. That’s all we have time for on today’s episode of Inside Cancer Careers! Thank you for joining us and thank you to our guests. We want to hear from you – your stories, your ideas and your feedback are always welcome.

T!tle : Expansion of data in the GDC - NCI
ur$ : https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/gdc-data-expansion-fmi
d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  2016  Significant expansion of data available in the Genomic Data Commons   News Releases   Posted:
June 29, 2016  240-760-6600 The recently launched Genomic Data Commons (GDC) will get a dramatic increase in the power and utility of its resources with the announcement today of the signing of a data sharing agreement between the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI), a molecular information company that has generated genomic profiles of people with cancer. NCI’s GDC is a unified data system that promotes the sharing of genomic and clinical data among researchers and is a core component of the Cancer Moonshot and the President’s Precision Medicine Initiative. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health. The expanded number of cancer cases in the GDC will allow researchers to identify genomic changes that are responsible for the cancerous growth of tumors in individual patients, and identify which drugs may block the effects of these mutations.  Such targeted drugs can produce remissions in certain patients. When the GDC was launched earlier this month, it was able to immediately capitalize on the genomic data that existed in several large-scale NCI programs, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and its pediatric equivalent, Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET). Together, TCGA and TARGET represent some of the largest and most comprehensive cancer genomic datasets in the world, with information generated from about 14,500 patients. The addition of data from 18,000 adult patients with a diverse array of cancers that underwent genomic profiling using FMI’s proprietary comprehensive genomic profiling assay, called FoundationOne (trademark registered), will provide a major boost to the GDC.  FMI developed FoundationOne as a commercially available test that uses advanced sequencing technology to routinely analyze cancer specimens. “This major infusion of data in the GDC will greatly enhance our ability to use this tool to explore genetic abnormalities in cancer,” said Douglas Lowy, M.D., NCI Acting Director. “Through TCGA and TARGET, we had already established a strong cancer genomic foundation for the GDC at its launch, but with the addition of the genomic data from FMI, we believe that the GDC will be an even more useful resource for researchers worldwide to help us unravel the complexities of many forms of cancer.” Importantly, in both the NCI and the Foundation Medicine databases, all patient information has been de-identified, meaning that personal information, such as addresses, Social Security numbers, and other possible identifiers, are not present — only crucial genetic data and key demographic information are available. “We’re honored to participate in this important global effort to transform patient care and to be the first commercial entity to contribute data to the NCI’s GDC, which we believe underscores the quality, integrity and richness of the genomics information contained in Foundation Medicine databases,” said Vincent Miller, M.D., chief medical officer, Foundation Medicine. “The amount of genomics information within Foundation Medicine databases has reached unparalleled scale. The insights gleaned from this data release will be instrumental in accelerating research and development efforts for targeted agents and immunotherapies.” The genomics information contributed by Foundation Medicine can be used by authorized researchers following approval by an NIH Data Access Committee.  Requesters must affirm that their use of the data is solely for biomedical research purposes and for publication or presentation in scientific journals or at research meetings. The National Cancer Institute leads the National Cancer Program and the NIH’s efforts to dramatically reduce the prevalence of cancer and improve the lives of cancer patients and their families, through research into prevention and cancer biology, the development of new interventions, and the training and mentoring of new researchers.

Drinking alcohol can increase your risk of cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, larynx (voice box), liver, and breast. The more you drink, the higher your risk. The risk of cancer is much higher for those who drink alcohol and also use tobacco. Doctors advise people who drink to do so in moderate amounts. The federal government’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans defines moderate alcohol drinking as up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men. It has been suggested that certain substances in red wine, such as resveratrol, have anticancer properties. However, there is no evidence that drinking red wine reduces the risk of cancer.

General Information About Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers  Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Screening  Risks of Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Screening  About This PDQ Summary  Screening is  looking for cancer before a person has any symptoms. This can help find
		cancer at an early stage. When abnormal tissue or cancer is found early, it may
		be easier to treat. By the time symptoms  appear, cancer may have begun
		to  spread. Scientists  are trying to better understand which
		people are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things
		we do and the things around us to see if they cause  cancer. This
		information helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which
		screening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done. It is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily
		think you have cancer if he or she suggests a  screening test. Screening
		tests are given when you  have no cancer symptoms. If a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called diagnostic tests. Ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells
		  form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum. In the United States, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women. Different factors increase or decrease the risk of getting ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers. The ovaries are a pair
		  of organs in the female reproductive
		  system. They are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the
		  uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped
		  organ where a fetus grows). Each
		  ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries produce eggs and
		  female hormones (chemicals that
		  control the way certain cells or
		  organs function). The fallopian tubes are a pair of long, slender tubes, one on each side of the uterus. Eggs pass from the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus. Cancer sometimes begins at the end of the fallopian tube near the ovary and spreads to the ovary. The  peritoneum is the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers organs in the abdomen. Primary peritoneal cancer is cancer that forms in the peritoneum and has not spread there from another part of the body. Cancer sometimes begins in the peritoneum and spreads to the ovary. Ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer form in the same type of tissue. Studies of screening tests look at these cancers together. For more information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers, see the following: Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Prevention Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Treatment Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors Treatment Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors Treatment While ovarian cancer is rare, it is the leading cause of  death from cancer of the female reproductive system. The number of new cases of ovarian cancer decreased slightly each year from 1990 to the mid-2010s, but increased slightly each year from 2014 to 2018. There was a slight decrease in the number of deaths from ovarian cancer each year from 2015 to 2019. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease
		  is called a risk factor. Anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a protective factor. For information about risk factors and protective factors for ovarian cancer, see Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Prevention. Talk to your doctor about your risk of ovarian cancer. Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does  not have symptoms. Screening tests have not been shown to decrease the chance of dying from ovarian cancer. Screening tests that have been studied include:Pelvic examTransvaginal ultrasound CA-125 assay Screening tests for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are being studied in clinical trials. Pelvic exam Transvaginal ultrasound CA-125 assay Scientists study screening tests to find those with the fewest harms and most benefits. Cancer screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes symptoms)  helps a person live longer or decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, the chance of recovery is better if the disease is found and treated at an early stage. Pelvic exams to screen for ovarian cancer have not been shown to decrease the number of deaths from the disease. A pelvic exam is an exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum.    A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.EnlargePelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) to screen for ovarian cancer has not been shown to decrease the number of deaths from the disease. TVU is a procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and bladder. An ultrasound transducer (probe)  is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. EnlargeTransvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture). A CA-125 assay is a test that measures the level of CA-125 in the blood.  CA-125 is a type of biomarker  (a substance released by cells into the bloodstream that may be a sign of a condition or disease). An increased CA-125 level is sometimes a sign of certain types of cancer, including ovarian cancer, or other conditions. Studies have also shown that using CA-125 levels and TVU together to screen for ovarian cancer does not decrease the number of deaths from ovarian cancer. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. Screening tests have risks. The risks of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers        screening tests include the following:
		  Finding ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers may not improve health or help a woman live
			 longer.False-negative test results can occur.False-positive test results can occur. Finding ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers may not improve health or help a woman live
			 longer. False-negative test results can occur. False-positive test results can occur. Decisions about screening tests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may
		  want to talk about  the test with your doctor.  It is important to know the risks of
		  the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from
		  cancer. Screening
			 may not improve your health or help  you live longer if  you have   advanced ovarian cancer or if it has already spread to
			 other places in  your body. Screening test results may appear to be normal even though ovarian cancer is
			 present. A woman who receives a false-negative test result (one that
			 shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care  even if she has symptoms. Screening test results may appear to be abnormal even though no
			 cancer is present. A false-positive test result (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause anxiety and is usually followed by more  tests  (such as
			  a laparoscopy or a laparotomy to see if cancer is present), which also have risks. Problems caused by tests used to diagnose ovarian cancer include infection, blood loss, bowel injury, and heart and blood vessel problems. A false-positive test result can also lead to an unneeded oophorectomy (removal of one or both ovaries). Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish. PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers screening.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board. A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

Caregiving After Treatment Ends


For Teens


For Parents  Survivorship  Questions to Ask About Cancer  Research   Caregiving After Treatment Ends  For Teens  For Parents  Children rely on their parents for honest and helpful information during treatment for cancer.  When a child has cancer, every member of the family needs support. Parents often feel shocked and overwhelmed following their child’s cancer diagnosis. Honest and calm conversations build trust as you talk with your child and his or her siblings. Taking care of yourself during this difficult time is important; it’s not selfish. As you dig deep for strength, reach out to your child’s treatment team and to people in your family and community for support. As you talk with your child, begin with the knowledge that you know your child best. Your child depends on you for helpful, accurate, and truthful information. Your child will learn a lot from your tone of voice and facial expressions, so stay calm when you talk with your child. When Your Child Is Diagnosed with Cancer Watch this video to hear how parents moved forward after their child was diagnosed with cancer and found a hospital with expertise in treating children with cancer. Access an audio described version of the video The age-related suggestions below may be helpful as you work with the health care team, so your child knows what to expect during treatment, copes well with procedures, and feels supported. If your child is less than 1 year old: Comfort your baby by holding and gently touching her. Skin to skin contact is ideal. Bring familiar items from home, such as toys or a blanket. Talk or sing to your child, since the sound of your voice is soothing. Try to keep up feeding and bedtime routines as much as possible. If your child is 1 to 2 years old: Very young children understand things they can see and touch. Toddlers like to play, so find safe ways to let your child play. Toddlers also like to start making choices, so let your child choose a sticker or a flavor of medicine when possible. Prepare your child ahead of time if something will hurt. Not doing so may cause your child to become fearful and anxious. If your child is 3 to 5 years old: To help your child understand his treatment better, ask the doctor if he can touch the models, machines, or supplies (tubes, bandages, or ports) ahead of time. If a procedure will hurt, prepare your child in advance. You can help to distract your child by reading a story or giving her a stuffed animal to hold. If your child is 6 to 12 years old: School-aged children understand that medicines and treatment help them get better. They are able to cooperate with treatment but want to know what to expect. Children this age often have many questions, so be ready to answer them or to find the answers together. Relationships are important, so help your child to stay in touch with friends and family. If your child is a teenager: Teens often focus on how cancer changes their lives—their friendships, their appearance, and their activities. They may be scared and angry about how cancer has isolated them from their friends. Look for ways to help your teen stay connected to friends. Give your teen some of the space and freedom he had before treatment and include him in treatment decisions. Information to help you choose a hospital and learn more about your child’s treatment plan is included in the Diagnosis section of our childhood cancer guide for parents. Practical information about childhood cancer, treatment, coping, and more for parents and health care providers. Talk with your child’s health care team to get your questions answered. You may also find the suggestions below helpful: Who should tell my child?
Many parents receive their child’s diagnosis from the doctor at the same time that their child learns of it. However, if you choose to be the one to tell your child, the doctor or nurse can help you decide what to say and how to answer her questions. When should my child be told?
Your child should be told as soon as possible. This will help build trust between you and your child. It does not mean that your child needs to hear everything all at once. What should I tell my child?
The information you share with your child depends on his age and what he can understand. Children of all ages need clear, simple information that makes sense to them. As much as possible, help him know what to expect by using ideas and words that he understands. Tell your child how treatment will make him feel and when something will hurt. Explain that strong medicine and treatments have helped other children. How much should I tell my child?
Help your child to understand the basic facts about the illness, the treatment, and what to expect. It may be hard for many children to process too many details or information given too far in advance. Start with small amounts of information that your child can understand. Children often use their imaginations to make up answers to unanswered questions and may fear the worst. Answering questions honestly and having ongoing conversations can help your child. Telling untruths can cause your child to distrust you or people on their health care team. How might my child react?
Each child is different. Some worry. Others get upset or become quiet, afraid, or defiant. Some express their feelings in words, others in actions. Some children regress to behaviors they had when they were younger. These are normal reactions to changes in life as they know it. Their schedule, the way they look and feel, and their friendships may all be changing. Expect that some days will be rough, and others will be easier. Tell your child, and find ways to show her, that you will always be there for her. What can I do to help my child cope?
Children take cues from their parents, so being calm and hopeful can help your child. Show your love. Think about how your child and family have handled difficult times in the past. Some children feel better after talking. Others prefer to draw, write, play games, or listen to music. Talk with your child’s health care team about how to answer questions your child may have. You may also find these suggestions helpful: What is cancer?
When talking about cancer with your child, start with simple words and concepts. Explain that cancer is not contagious—it’s not an illness that children catch from someone or that they can give to someone else. Young children may understand that they have a lump (tumor) that is making them sick or that their blood is not working the way it should. Parents and older children may want to read about different types of childhood cancer in the Diagnosis section of our childhood cancer guide for parents. Why did I get cancer?
Some children think they did something bad or wrong to cause the cancer. Others wonder why they got sick. Tell your child that nothing he—or anyone else—did caused the cancer, and that doctors are working to learn more about what causes cancer in children. You may tell your child: I don't know. Not even doctors know exactly why one child gets cancer and another doesn't. We do know that you didn’t do anything wrong, you didn't catch it from someone, and it’s not contagious.  Will I get better?
Being in the hospital or having many medical appointments can be scary for a child. Some children may know or have heard about a person who has died from cancer. Your child may wonder if she will get better. You may tell your child: Cancer is a serious illness, and your doctors and nurses are giving you treatments that have helped other children. We are going to do all we can to help you get better. Let's talk with your doctor and nurse to learn more about the type of cancer you have.  How will I feel during treatment?
Your child may wonder how he may feel during treatment. Children with cancer often see others who have lost their hair or are very sick. Talk with the nurse or social worker to learn how your child’s treatment may affect how your child looks and feels, and about side effects that he may have. You may tell your child: Even when two children have the same type of cancer, what happens to one child may not happen to the other. Your doctors and I will talk with you and explain what we know. We will all work together as a team to help you feel as comfortable as possible during treatment.  Cancer treatment brings many changes to a child’s life and outlook. You can help your child by letting her live as normal a life as possible. Talk with the health care team to learn what to expect, as your child goes through treatment, so your child and family can prepare. Supporting Your Child with Cancer Listen to insights from pediatric oncology experts and parents on how to help your child when they are going through treatment for childhood cancer. Access an audio described version of the video Children can be sensitive about how they look and how others respond to them. Here are ways to help your child: Prepare for physical changes: If treatment will cause your child's hair to fall out, let your child pick out a fun cap, scarf, and/or wig ahead of time. Some treatments may cause changes in weight. Meeting with a registered dietitian can help your child get the nutrients her body needs to stay strong during treatment.  Side effects: Your child’s nurse will talk with you and your child about supportive care. This is care that is given to manage side effects and improve your child’s quality of life. Information to help lower pain, provide good nutrition, prevent infection, and manage common health problems during treatment is also in the Treatment section of our childhood cancer guide for parents.  Help your child know how to respond: Sometimes people will stare, mistake your child's gender, or ask personal questions. Talk with your child and come up with an approach that works. Your child may choose to respond or to ignore comments.  Your child's friendships are tested and may change during a serious illness, like cancer. Sometimes it may seem as though old friends are no longer “there for them.” It may help if your child takes the first step and reaches out to friends. Children may also make new friends through this experience. Here are some steps you can take with your child: Help your child stay in touch with friends: You can encourage or help your child connect with friends through text messages, video chats, phone calls, and/or social media.  Get tips and advice: A social worker or child-life specialist can help your child think through what they would and would not like to share with friends. If possible, and when your child is up to it, friends may be able to visit. Your child may also be able to participate in school and other activities, based on the advice of their doctor.  Although over time many children with cancer cope well, your child may feel anxious, sad, stressed, scared, or become withdrawn at times. Talk with your child about what she is feeling and help her find ways to cope. Your child can also meet with a child-life specialist or psychologist about feelings that don’t have easy solutions or seem to be getting worse over time. These tips may help your child cope with difficult emotions: Find ways to distract and entertain your child: Playing video games or watching movies can help your child to relax. You can also learn about other practice that can support your child during treatment, such as: art therapy, biofeedback, guided imagery, hypnosis, laughter therapy, massage therapy, meditation, music therapy,  and relaxation therapy, among others. Learn more about integrative medicine practices that help children in the Resources section of our childhood cancer guide for parents.  Stay calm but do not hide your feelings: Your child can feel your emotions. If you often feel sad or anxious, talk with your doctor and child's health care team so you can manage these emotions. Yet keep in mind that if you often hide your feelings, your child may also hide their feelings from you.  Get help if you see emotional changes in your child: While it’s normal for your child to feel down or sad at times, if these feelings happen on most days over a long period of time, they may be signs that your child needs extra support. Meeting with your child's nurse, child-life specialist, and/or psychologist can help your child learn how to manage stress, and they can assess your child for mental health conditions such as an anxiety disorder and depression.  Your child may spend more time in the hospital and at home, during treatment. Here are ways to help your child cope with periods of isolation and time away from friends. Hospital stays: Being in the hospital can especially difficult for children. It’s a different setting, with new people and routines, large machines, and sometimes painful procedures. Bring in comfort items. Let your child choose favorite things from home, such as photos, games, and music. These items can comfort children and help them to relax.  Visit game rooms, playrooms, and teen rooms. Many hospitals have places where patients can play, relax, and spend time with other patients. These rooms often have toys, games, crafts, music, and computers. Encourage your child to take part in social events and activities that are offered at the hospital.  Isolation at home: While your child is receiving treatment, she may need to stay at home for extended periods of time, due to the side effects of cancer treatment such as fatigue, risk of infection, pain, and gastrointestinal complications, for example. Decorate your child’s room. Posters, pictures, and other decorations may brighten the room and help cheer up your child. Window markers are a fun way to decorate. Check to see if any items should be removed from your child’s room, since there are sometimes medical restrictions.  Explore new activities. If sports are off-limits, learn about other activities that can help your child stay active and have fun. Your child may also enjoy listening to music, reading, playing games, or writing. Some children with cancer discover new skills and interests they never knew they had.  Missing school: While some children with cancer are able to attend school, many need to take a leave of absence for short or long periods of time. Here are ways to get the academic support your child needs during this time: Meet with your child's doctor to learn more about how treatment may affect your child's energy level and ability to keep up with schoolwork. Ask the doctor to write a letter to your child’s teachers that describes your child’s medical situation, limitations, and how much time your child is likely to miss.  Keep your child's teachers updated. Tell your child's teachers and principal about your child's medical situation. Share the letter from your child's doctor. Learn what schoolwork your child will miss and about ways for your child to keep up, as they are able.  Learn about assistance from the hospital and your child's school. Hospitals have education coordinators or nurses who can talk with you about academic resources and assistance for your child. You will also want to ask about an individualized education plan (IEP), also called a 504 plan, for your child.  Learn more about ways to help your child cope in the Support section of our childhood cancer guide for parents. These suggestions can help you care for yourself, your children, and your family. Parents often say that their child’s diagnosis feels like a family diagnosis. Here is practical advice to help families cope and stay connected during this challenging time. Support for Your Family When a Child Has Cancer Everyone in the family needs support when a child has cancer. Get tips related to self-care, marriage, and support for siblings from oncology experts and parents. Access an audio described version of the video Relationships and partnerships are strained and under pressure when a child has cancer. However, marriages can also grow stronger during this time. Here’s what parents said helped: Keep lines of communication open: Talk about how you each deal best with stress. Make time to connect, even when time is limited.  Remember that no two people cope the same way: Couples often have different coping strategies. If your spouse or partner does not seem as distraught as you, it does not mean he or she is suffering any less than you are.  Make time: Even a quick call, text message, or handwritten note can go a long way in making your spouse’s or child’s day a better one.  Research shows what you most likely already know—that help from others strengthens and encourages your child and family. Family and friends may want to assist but might not know what you need. It may help to: Find an easy way to update family and friends: Consider posting updates and getting practical support through sites such as Caring Bridge, My Cancer Circle, MyLifeLine, or  Lotsa Helping Hands. Share only what you feel comfortable sharing.  Be specific about how people can support your family: Keep a list handy of things that others can do for your family. For example, people can cook, clean, grocery shop, or drive siblings to their activities.  Join a support group: Some groups meet in person, whereas others meet online. Many parents benefit from the experiences and information shared by other parents.  Seek professional help: If you are not sleeping well or are depressed, talk with your primary care doctor or people on your child’s health care team. Ask them to recommend a mental health specialist such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, or social worker.  It can be tempting to put your own needs on hold and focus solely on your sick child. However, it’s essential that you make time for yourself. Doing so can also give you energy to care for your child. Here are some tips to help get you started: Find ways to relax and lower stress: Some parents try something new, such as a yoga or deep-breathing class at the hospital. Others are refreshed by being outdoors, even for short periods. Whatever the method or place, find one that feels peaceful to you. Here are techniques you can use to relax, from a page that’s helpful for both patients and parents alike.  Fill waiting time: Pick a few activities that you enjoy and can do at the hospital, such as playing a game, reading, writing, or listening to music.  Stay physically active: Plan to walk, jog, go to the gym, or follow a workout app. Exercising with a friend or family member can make it easier to keep up the routine. If it’s hard to stay physically active at the hospital, try walking up and down the stairs or around the hospital or unit. Physical activity helps to lower stress and can also help you to sleep better at night.  Learn more about ways to cope and stay strong in the Support section of our childhood cancer guide for parents and in Support for Caregivers of Cancer Patients. Information for teens and children who have a sibling with cancer. As a parent, you want to be there for all your children, yet this can be challenging when a child is being treated for cancer. You may notice that siblings are having a difficult time yet struggle to address their needs. Insights and suggestions on strategies to help siblings are shared in the video above. Here are some more ways you can help siblings during this difficult time: Listen to and connect with siblings: Set aside some time every day, even if it’s just a few minutes, to spend with your other children. Check in and ask how they are doing, even if you do not have an easy solution to every challenge they may be facing. It’s important to connect with and listen to them.  Keep siblings informed and involved: Talk with your children about their sibling’s cancer and tell them what to expect during treatment. If possible, find ways to include them in hospital visits. If you are far from home, find ways to connect through video chat, text messages, and phone calls, for example.  Keep things as normal as you can: Arrange to keep siblings involved in school-related events and activities that are important to them. Ask friends and neighbors for support. Most people want to help and will appreciate being asked.  This booklet When Your Brother or Sister Has Cancer has quotes from siblings  about their experiences, checklists to help siblings get support, and a section of related organizations and resources. It can be printed or viewed as a booklet, an ePub, or a Kindle book. A hard copy of the booklet can also be ordered, for no charge. These suggestions can help you and your child to establish strong and effective relationships with your child’s health care team. Build strong partnerships
	Give and expect to receive respect from the people on your child’s health care team. Open and honest communication will also make it easier for you to ask questions, discuss options, and feel confident that your child is in good hands.  Take advantage of the many specialists who can help your child
	Work with them to help your child learn about cancer, how it will be treated, prepare for tests, manage side effects, and cope.  If you get information online, make sure the source is credible
	It’s important to get accurate information that you understand and can use to make decisions. Share what you find with the health care team to confirm that it applies to your child.  Make sure you understand what your child’s health care team tells you
	Speak up when something is confusing or unclear, especially when decisions need to be made. Ask to see pictures or videos to help understand new medical information.  Keep your child’s pediatrician updated
	Ask for updates to be sent to your child’s regular pediatrician.

Past Programs  Funding  Researcher Resources  News & Events  About DCB  Progress   Past Programs  Kai Tan, Ph.D., a CSBC investigator at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), has always been fascinated by things that are complicated. This led him from graduate studies of genetic networks in bacteria to his current work using systems approaches to understand complex biological interactions during development and disease. In this interview, Dr. Tan shares his views on systems biology, his advice for students and trainees, and his CSBC research that is identifying targets for combination therapy in a high-risk pediatric cancer. In my opinion, the unifying question for this field is to understand how the interactions of all the players in the system give rise to an observed phenotype. There are different approaches and different systems, which range from trying to understand one signaling pathway to studying an entire protein-protein interaction network of a given cell type. However, I think the key is understanding the interactions, whether they are on a smaller scale or a complex, multi-scale level. People coming from a physics or chemistry background could be thinking about dynamics of interactions in a system. Computer scientists are probably focusing on graph and binary interactions. These are just different ways to handle the central question of how interactions affect the system. When I was working on my Ph.D. thesis, I was performing studies in the area now known as genomics. It’s important to remember that genomics is not the same as systems biology. Then, I went to do a post-doc with Dr. Trey Ideker (who is currently a CSBC investigator at the University of California San Diego). He is a pioneer in the systemic analysis of molecular interactions. I think that's how I learned this conceptual framework, which is at the core of systems biology research. Get every opportunity to expose yourself to different areas and concepts! For instance, if you're a biologist or in computer science, go and read physics and chemistry journals. People always talk about creativity coming from maximum stimulation - a shock to your neurons. To be a successful and innovative researcher in systems biology, you need to expose yourself to concepts from different fields. Cancers are really complex systems with all kinds of redundancy. There are pathways to overcome treatments, genetic buffering, and so much more. Now, with single cell analysis, we can really appreciate the heterogeneity of cancer at many different levels. Moving forward, we can combine what already exists in terms of systems biology approaches, such as modeling networks, with single-cell concepts of heterogeneity. It will be interesting to observe how this integration can really push the cancer research field forward. Combination therapy is an important therapeutic strategy for many cancers, especially metastatic cancers and tumors that don’t respond to standard treatments. However, identifying a target for combination therapy is very challenging. We use an interesting computational framework called network controllability theory. It allows us to treat the gene regulatory network in a cancer as a control circuit. This theory was developed in the seventies by electrical engineers and systems scientists. Although the original framework is not new, it wasn’t applied to a biological system until very recently. From the theoretical point of view, we are also developing additional bells and whistles to allow us to accommodate noisy biological data. Another challenge we're trying to address is that, although we are currently mapping a lot of networks, cell type or disease-specific network data is really sparse. We propose to use omics assays to generate a disease-specific network as input for our computational framework. Once this network is generated, it will also be invaluable to other researchers who can use it to study cancer or as a test bed for their algorithm development. Additionally, we plan to rigorously test our computational predictions for targets of combination therapies using mouse models. B-cell leukemia is the most frequent type of pediatric cancer. Like many other cancers, B-cell leukemia is heterogeneous. There are at least 6 subtypes with different treatment responses and prognosis. With certain subtypes, patient survival is over 90% due to modern therapies. However, the Ph-like B-ALL subtype has a very high rate of relapse and the overall survival rate of kids with this type of cancer is only 60%.

Retinoblastoma Treatment  Health Professional  Research   Retinoblastoma Treatment   General Information About Retinoblastoma  Stages of Retinoblastoma  Treatment Option Overview  Treatment of Unilateral, Bilateral, and Cavitary Retinoblastoma  Treatment of Extraocular Retinoblastoma  Treatment of Progressive or Recurrent Retinoblastoma  To Learn More About Childhood Cancer  About This PDQ Summary  Retinoblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in
		  the tissues of the retina. Children with a family history of retinoblastoma should have eye exams to check for retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma occurs in heritable and nonheritable forms. A child who has heritable retinoblastoma has an increased risk of trilateral retinoblastoma and other cancers. Genetic testing can determine whether a child has the heritable or nonheritable form of retinoblastoma. Signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma  include "white pupil" and eyes that appear to be looking in different directions (crossed eyes). Tests that examine the retina are used to diagnose retinoblastoma. Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The retina is made of  nerve tissue that lines the inside wall of the  back of the eye.  It receives light and converts the light into signals that travel down the optic nerve to the brain. The brain decodes the signals so that you can see the image. EnlargeAnatomy of the eye, showing the outside and inside of the eye including the sclera, cornea, iris, ciliary body, choroid, retina, vitreous humor, and optic nerve. The vitreous humor is a gel that fills the center of the eye. Retinoblastoma may be in one eye  (unilateral) or in both eyes (bilateral). Cavitary retinoblastoma is a rare type of retinoblastoma in which cavities (hollow spaces) form within the tumor. Although retinoblastoma may occur at any age, it occurs most often in children younger than 2 years. A child with a family history of retinoblastoma should have regular eye exams beginning early in life to check for retinoblastoma, unless it is known that the child does not have the RB1 gene change. Early diagnosis of retinoblastoma may mean the child will need less intense treatment. Talk with your child’s doctor about the type of eye exam, how often eye exams are done, and at what age eye exams to check for retinoblastoma can stop. A child is thought to have the heritable (inherited) form of retinoblastoma when there is a certain mutation (change) in the RB1 gene. The mutation in the RB1 gene may be passed from the parent to the child, or it may occur in the egg or sperm before conception or soon after conception. Other factors that suggest the child may have the heritable form of retinoblastoma include the following: There is a family history of retinoblastoma. There is more than one tumor in the eye. There is a tumor in both eyes. After heritable retinoblastoma has been diagnosed and treated, new tumors may continue to form for a few years. Regular eye exams to check for new tumors are usually done every 2 to 4 months for at least 28 months. Most cases of retinoblastoma are the nonheritable form. Nonheritable retinoblastoma is not passed down from parents. This type of retinoblastoma is caused by mutations in the RB1 gene that occur by chance after a child is born. Nonheritable retinoblastoma usually occurs in one eye. A child with heritable retinoblastoma has an increased risk of a pineal tumor in the brain. When retinoblastoma and a brain tumor occur at the same time, it is called trilateral retinoblastoma. The brain tumor is usually diagnosed between 20 and 36 months of age. Regular screening using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) may be done for a child  thought to have heritable retinoblastoma or for a child with retinoblastoma in one eye and a family history of the disease. CT (computerized tomography)   scans are usually not used for routine screening in order to avoid exposing the child  to ionizing radiation. Heritable retinoblastoma also increases the child's risk of other types of cancer such as lung cancer, bladder cancer, or melanoma in later years. Regular follow-up exams are  important. It is not always clear from the family medical history whether a condition is inherited. Certain families may benefit from genetic counseling and genetic testing. Genetic counselors and other specially trained health professionals can help parents understand the following: Their family medical history. Their options for RB1 gene testing. The risk of retinoblastoma for the child and the child's brothers or sisters. The risks and benefits of learning genetic information. Genetic counselors can also help people cope with their genetic testing results, including how to discuss the results with family members. Once it is known  that the child has heritable retinoblastoma, other family members can be screened for the RB1 mutation. For one specific mutation, the risk of retinoblastoma in a sibling may depend partly on whether the mutation is inherited from the mother or from the father. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by retinoblastoma or by other conditions. Check with a doctor if your child has any of the  following: Pupil of the eye that appears white instead of red when  light shines into it. This may be seen in flash photographs of the child.EnlargeClose-up photograph showing the eyes of a child with retinoblastoma. The pupil of the eye on the left side of the photo appears white compared to the pupil of the eye on the right side of the photo. A "white pupil" may be a sign of retinoblastoma. Eyes  that appear to be looking in different directions (crossed eyes). Pain or redness in the eye. Infection around the eye. Eyeball that is larger than normal. Colored part of the eye and pupil look cloudy. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and health history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. The doctor will ask if there is a family history of retinoblastoma. Eye exam with dilated pupil: An exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (opened wider)   with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the  lens and pupil to the retina. The inside of the eye, including the retina and the optic nerve, is examined with a  light. In young children, this exam may be done under anesthesia.There are several types of eye exams that are done with the pupil dilated:Ophthalmoscopy: An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light.Fluorescein angiography: A procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood inside the eye.   An orange fluorescent  dye called fluorescein is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any blood vessels that are blocked or leaking.Electroretinography: An eye test that uses light and small electrodes to study the retina (the light-detecting part of the eye). This test measures and records  the faint electrical signals given off  by the cells in  the retina when exposed to different types and amounts of light. It can be used to assess the function of the retina during and after treatment. RB1 gene test: A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for a change in the RB1 gene. Ultrasound exam of the eye: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes.   Eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is  placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a picture of the inside of the eye and the distance from the cornea to the retina is measured. The picture, called a sonogram, shows  on the screen of the ultrasound monitor. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the eye. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). There are several types of eye exams that are done with the pupil dilated: Ophthalmoscopy: An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light. Fluorescein angiography: A procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood inside the eye.   An orange fluorescent  dye called fluorescein is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any blood vessels that are blocked or leaking. Electroretinography: An eye test that uses light and small electrodes to study the retina (the light-detecting part of the eye). This test measures and records  the faint electrical signals given off  by the cells in  the retina when exposed to different types and amounts of light. It can be used to assess the function of the retina during and after treatment. Retinoblastoma can usually be diagnosed without a  biopsy. When retinoblastoma is in one eye, it sometimes forms in the other eye. Exams of the unaffected eye are done until it is known that the retinoblastoma is the nonheritable form. The prognosis and treatment options depend on the following: Whether the cancer is in one or both eyes. The size and number of  tumors. Whether the tumor has spread to the area around the eye, to the brain, or to other parts of the body. The age of the child. How likely it is that vision can be saved in one or both eyes. Whether a second type of cancer has formed. Whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred (come back). After retinoblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out
		  if cancer cells have spread within the eye or to other parts of the body. The International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS) may be used for staging retinoblastoma. Stage 0Stage IStage IIStage IIIStage IV There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. Treatment for retinoblastoma depends on whether it is intraocular (within the eye) or extraocular (outside the eye). Intraocular retinoblastoma
Extraocular retinoblastoma
(metastatic) Treatment for retinoblastoma also depends on whether the cancer has progressed or recurred. Stage 0 Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV Intraocular retinoblastoma Extraocular retinoblastoma
(metastatic) The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the eye or
		  to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging
		  process determines whether retinoblastoma is only in the eye (intraocular) or has spread outside the eye (extraocular). It is important to know
the stage in order to plan treatment. The results of the tests and procedures used to diagnose cancer are often also used to stage the disease. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process: MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Bone scan:  A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner that also takes a picture of the body.

Areas of bone with cancer show up brighter in the picture because they take up more radioactive material than normal bone cells do.EnlargeBone scan.  A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the child's vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive material collects in the bones. As the child lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is done if the doctor thinks the cancer has spread outside of the eye.EnlargeBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope. Lumbar puncture: A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord and sometimes it is also checked for a tumor marker called ganglioside GD2. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap. There are several staging systems for retinoblastoma. The IRSS stages are based on how much cancer remains after surgery to remove the tumor and whether the cancer has spread. The tumor is in the eye only. The eye has not been removed and the tumor was treated without surgery. The tumor is in the eye only. The eye has been removed and no cancer cells remain. The tumor is in the eye only. The eye has been removed and cancer cells remain that can be seen only with a microscope. Stage III is divided into stage IIIa and stage IIIb: In stage IIIa, cancer has spread from the eye to tissues around the eye socket. In stage IIIb, cancer has spread from the eye to lymph nodes near the ear or in the neck. Stage IV is divided into stage IVa and stage IVb: In stage IVa, cancer has spread to one or more parts of the body, such as the bone or liver. In stage IVb, cancer has spread to the brain or spinal cord. It also may have spread to other parts of the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  retinoblastoma spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually retinoblastoma cells. The disease is metastatic retinoblastoma, not bone cancer. In intraocular retinoblastoma, cancer is found in  one or both eyes and may be in the retina only or may also be in other parts of the eye such as   the choroid, ciliary body,  or part of the optic nerve. Cancer has not spread to  tissues around the outside of the eye or to other parts of the body. In extraocular retinoblastoma, cancer has spread beyond the eye. It may be found in  tissues around the eye (orbital retinoblastoma), or it may have spread to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or to other parts of the body such as the liver, bone, bone marrow, or lymph nodes. Progressive retinoblastoma is cancer that continues to grow, spread or get worse. Progressive disease may be a sign that the cancer has become refractory to treatment. Recurrent retinoblastoma is cancer that has recurred (come back)  after it has been treated. The cancer may recur in the eye,  in tissues around the eye, or  in other places in the body, such as the liver, bone, bone marrow, or lymph nodes. There are different types of treatment for patients with retinoblastoma. Children with retinoblastoma should have their treatment
		  planned by a team of      health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children. Six types of standard treatment are used:CryotherapyThermotherapyChemotherapy Radiation therapyHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescueSurgery (enucleation) New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.Targeted therapy Treatment for retinoblastoma may cause side effects. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Follow-up tests may be needed. Cryotherapy Thermotherapy Chemotherapy Radiation therapy High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue Surgery (enucleation) Targeted therapy Different types of treatment are available for patients with retinoblastoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some
		  are being tested in clinical trials.
		  A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help
		  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients
		  with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the
		  standard treatment, the new
		  treatment may become the standard treatment. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. The goals of treatment are to save the child's life, to save vision and the eye, and to prevent serious side effects. Treatment will be overseen by a
		  pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes
		  in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist  works with
		  other health care providers who are experts in treating children
		  with eye cancer and who specialize
		  in certain areas of medicine. These may include a pediatric ophthalmologist (children's eye doctor) who has a lot of experience in treating retinoblastoma and the following
		  specialists: Pediatric surgeon. Radiation
			 oncologist. Pediatrician. Pediatric nurse specialist. Rehabilitation specialist. Social worker. Geneticist or genetic counselor. Cryotherapy is the use of extreme cold to destroy abnormal tissue.  A small metal probe is cooled below freezing and placed on the surface of the eye near the tumor, which freezes and kills cancer cells. Cryotherapy is usually used to treat small retinoblastoma tumors that are located toward the front of the eye. This type of treatment is also called cryosurgery. Thermotherapy is the use of  heat to destroy cancer cells.  Thermotherapy may be given using a laser beam aimed through the dilated pupil  or  onto the outside of the eyeball. Thermotherapy may be used alone for small tumors or combined with chemotherapy for larger tumors. This treatment is a type of laser therapy. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the stage of the cancer and where the cancer is in the body. There are different types of chemotherapy: Systemic chemotherapy: When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body. Systemic chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumor (chemoreduction) and avoid surgery to remove the eye. After chemoreduction, other treatments may include radiation therapy, cryotherapy, laser therapy, or regional chemotherapy. However, extraorbital disease requires intensive chemotherapy and may include consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation with or without radiation therapy.Systemic chemotherapy may also be given to kill any cancer cells that are left after the initial treatment or to kill cancer cells that are outside the eye. Treatment given after the initial treatment, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Regional chemotherapy: When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy),  an organ (such as the eye), or a body cavity, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas. Several types of regional chemotherapy are used to treat retinoblastoma.Ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy: Ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy carries anticancer drugs directly to the eye. A catheter is put into an artery that leads to the eye and the anticancer drug is given through the catheter.  After the drug is given, a small balloon may be inserted into the artery to block it and keep most of the anticancer drug trapped near the tumor. This type of chemotherapy may be given as the initial treatment when the tumor is in the eye only or when the tumor has not responded to other types of treatment. Ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy is given at special retinoblastoma treatment centers. Intravitreal chemotherapy: Intravitreal chemotherapy is the injection of anticancer drugs directly into the vitreous humor (jelly-like substance) inside of the eye. It is used to treat cancer that has spread to the vitreous humor and has not responded to treatment or has come back after treatment. Intrathecal chemotherapy: Intrathecal chemotherapy is the injection of anticancer drugs directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is used to treat cancer that has spread to the brain. Systemic chemotherapy may also be given to kill any cancer cells that are left after the initial treatment or to kill cancer cells that are outside the eye. Treatment given after the initial treatment, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy: Ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy carries anticancer drugs directly to the eye. A catheter is put into an artery that leads to the eye and the anticancer drug is given through the catheter.  After the drug is given, a small balloon may be inserted into the artery to block it and keep most of the anticancer drug trapped near the tumor. This type of chemotherapy may be given as the initial treatment when the tumor is in the eye only or when the tumor has not responded to other types of treatment. Ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy is given at special retinoblastoma treatment centers. Intravitreal chemotherapy: Intravitreal chemotherapy is the injection of anticancer drugs directly into the vitreous humor (jelly-like substance) inside of the eye. It is used to treat cancer that has spread to the vitreous humor and has not responded to treatment or has come back after treatment. Intrathecal chemotherapy: Intrathecal chemotherapy is the injection of anticancer drugs directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is used to treat cancer that has spread to the brain. See Drugs Approved for Retinoblastoma for more information. Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.  There are two types of radiation therapy: External-beam radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.  Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:Intensity-modulated radiation therapy      (IMRT):  IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of  the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.Proton beam radiation therapy: Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells.  This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy tissue near a tumor. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.  Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. This type of internal radiation therapy may include the following:Plaque radiotherapy: Radioactive seeds are attached to one side of a disk, called a plaque, and placed directly on the outside wall of the 
 eye near the tumor.  The 
side of the plaque with the seeds on it faces the eyeball, aiming  radiation at 
 the tumor. The plaque helps  protect other nearby tissue from the radiation.EnlargePlaque radiotherapy of the eye.  A type of radiation therapy used to treat eye tumors. Radioactive seeds are placed on one side of a thin piece of metal (usually gold) called a plaque.  The plaque is sewn onto the outside wall of the eye.  The seeds give off radiation which kills the cancer. The plaque is removed at the end of treatment, which usually lasts for several days. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy      (IMRT):  IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of  the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. Proton beam radiation therapy: Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells.  This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy tissue near a tumor. Plaque radiotherapy: Radioactive seeds are attached to one side of a disk, called a plaque, and placed directly on the outside wall of the 
 eye near the tumor.  The 
side of the plaque with the seeds on it faces the eyeball, aiming  radiation at 
 the tumor. The plaque helps  protect other nearby tissue from the radiation.EnlargePlaque radiotherapy of the eye.  A type of radiation therapy used to treat eye tumors. Radioactive seeds are placed on one side of a thin piece of metal (usually gold) called a plaque.  The plaque is sewn onto the outside wall of the eye.  The seeds give off radiation which kills the cancer. The plaque is removed at the end of treatment, which usually lasts for several days. Whether internal or external radiation therapy is given depends on the stage of the cancer being treated, where it is found in the body, and how the cancer responded to other treatments. High doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cell rescue is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. Extraorbital disease requires intensive chemotherapy and may include consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation with or without radiation therapy. See Drugs Approved for Retinoblastoma for more information. Enucleation is surgery to remove  the eye  and part of the optic nerve. A sample of the eye tissue that is removed will be checked under a microscope to see if there are any signs that the cancer is likely to spread to other parts of the body. This should be done by an experienced pathologist, who is familiar with retinoblastoma and other diseases of the eye. Enucleation is done if there is little or no chance that vision can be saved and when the tumor is large, did not respond to treatment, or comes back after treatment. The patient will be fitted for an artificial eye. Close follow-up is needed for 2 years or more  to check for signs of recurrence in the area around the affected eye and to check the other eye. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Oncolytic virus therapy: This treatment uses a virus that infects and breaks down cancer cells but not normal cells. An oncolytic adenovirus targeting the RB1 gene is injected into the tumor and may have anticancer effects in retinoblastoma. Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of retinoblastoma that has progressed or red. To learn more about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, visit Side Effects. Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of treatment for retinoblastoma may include the following: Physical problems such as seeing or hearing problems. If the eye is removed, there may be changes in the shape and size of the bone around the eye until an artificial eye is fitted. This is most likely to occur in children aged younger than 3 years. Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory. Second cancers (new types of cancer), such as lung and bladder cancers, osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, or melanoma. The following risk factors may increase the risk of having a second cancer: Having the heritable form of retinoblastoma. Past treatment with radiation therapy, especially before age 1 year. Having already had a previous second cancer. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. Regular follow-up by health professionals who are experts in diagnosing and treating late effects is important. See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or checkups. Some tests that were done to diagnose or stage the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). In retinoblastoma, new tumors may form for a few years after treatment. Regular eye exams are done to check for tumors in both eyes. Children with the heritable form of retinoblastoma will also have imaging tests to check whether cancer has spread to the brain. For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section. If it is likely that the eye can be saved, treatment may include the following: Systemic chemotherapy or ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy, with or without intravitreal chemotherapy, to shrink the tumor. This may be followed by one or more of the following:Cryotherapy. Thermotherapy.Plaque radiotherapy. External-beam radiation therapy for bilateral intraocular retinoblastoma that does not respond to other treatments. Cryotherapy. Thermotherapy. Plaque radiotherapy. If the tumor is large and it is not likely that the eye can be saved, treatment may include the following: Surgery (enucleation). After surgery, systemic chemotherapy may be given to lower the risk that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body. When retinoblastoma is in both eyes, the treatment for each eye may be different, depending on the size of the tumor and whether it is likely that the eye can be saved. The dose of systemic chemotherapy  is usually based on the eye that has more cancer. Patients with cavitary retinoblastoma respond well to treatment and have favorable long-term outcomes, similar to patients with noncavitary retinoblastoma. For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section. Treatment of extraocular retinoblastoma (cancer has spread to the area around the eye) may include the following: Systemic chemotherapy and external-beam radiation therapy. Enucleation. Systemic chemotherapy followed by surgery (enucleation). External-beam radiation therapy and more chemotherapy may be given after surgery. Treatment for extraocular retinoblastoma (cancer has spread to the brain) may include the following: Systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy and external-beam radiation therapy to the brain and spinal cord. Chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue with or without radiation therapy. It is not clear whether treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue helps patients with extraocular retinoblastoma live longer. For trilateral retinoblastoma (retinoblastoma and a brain tumor that occur at the same time), treatment may include the following: Systemic chemotherapy followed by surgery and high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. Systemic chemotherapy followed by surgery and external-beam radiation therapy. For retinoblastoma that has spread to other parts of the body, but not the brain, treatment may include the following: Systemic chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue and external-beam radiation therapy. Use our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. General information  about clinical trials is also available. For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section. Treatment of progressive or recurrent intraocular retinoblastoma may include the following: External-beam radiation therapy or plaque radiotherapy. Cryotherapy. Thermotherapy. Systemic chemotherapy or ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy. Intravitreal chemotherapy. Surgery (enucleation). A clinical trial of targeted therapy with an oncolytic virus  that targets the RB1 gene and is injected into the tumor.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish. PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of retinoblastoma.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board. A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

Research Articles   Research Articles  Colorectal cells grown into organoids, stem cell-derived human 'mini-organs' that are used to study human development and disease. NCI-funded researchers are working to advance our understanding of how to prevent, detect, and treat colorectal cancer. They are also looking at what factors influence screening behaviors, how to address disparities, and the rising rates of colorectal cancer in younger people. This page highlights some of the latest colorectal cancer research, including clinical advances that may soon translate into improved care, NCI-supported programs that are fueling progress, and findings from recent studies. Screening can prevent colorectal cancer through detection of precancerous growths, or polyps, which can be removed before they become cancerous. It can also allow colorectal cancers to be detected early, before they cause symptoms and when treatment may be more effective. Colorectal cancer screening tests. These include colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, stool-based tests to detect hidden blood (fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) or fecal occult blood testing (FOBT)), and virtual colonoscopy. (See Screening Tests to Detect Colorectal Cancer and Polyps for more information.) Despite the availability of effective colorectal cancer screening tests, some people choose not to get screened. Some reasons may be because of the personal nature of the procedures, a lack of recommendation by their doctor, perceived costs or lack of insurance, or the preparation involved for a colonoscopy. Researchers find four “red flag” signs that may identify colorectal cancer early in younger adults. Although not currently recommended for screening, there are new techniques under development such as: finding technologies that improve the genetic analysis of stool samples, which may reveal the presence of tumor DNA  looking at changes in the gut microbiome and trying to identify specific bacteria that could potentially help identify patients at risk for colorectal cancer  Repeat screening or follow-up. The guideline for getting a screening colonoscopy is every 10 years. However, people who have noncancerous polyps detected at colonoscopy are generally asked to return for a repeat colonoscopy earlier than that. NCI’s FORTE Colorectal Cancer Prevention Trial, is now looking at whether some people with one or two small polyps can wait 10 years before returning for another colonoscopy. By comparing two study groups, one with repeat colonoscopy after 5 years, and one with repeat colonoscopy after 10 years, researchers hope to learn whether waiting 10 years is as good at preventing colorectal cancer as follow-up exams after 5 years. For colorectal cancer screening to be effective, people need to follow up on abnormal test results. In one study, researchers found that people who had a positive at-home stool test to screen for colorectal cancer, but did not have a follow-up colonoscopy, were twice as likely to die from colorectal cancer as those who did have a follow-up colonoscopy. NCI is funding research to better understand the many factors that can contribute to why a person may not have a follow-up test and how to increase repeat screening and follow-up colonoscopy after abnormal stool tests. Researchers are also studying how the many levels of the healthcare delivery system affect the decision to get screened. Surgically removing the cancer is the most common treatment for many stages of colorectal cancer. Chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, radiofrequency ablation, and cryosurgery are other treatments that may be used to treat colorectal cancer, depending on the stage. Because of an increased risk of recurrence, differences in anatomy, and poorer prognosis, the treatment of rectal cancer may differ from that of colon cancer. Although surgery remains a common type of treatment for local and locally advanced rectal cancer, people with some stages may be treated with radiation, chemotherapy, and/or targeted therapy with or without surgery. In addition to these standard treatments for rectal cancer, researchers continue to study both new treatments, such as immunotherapies, and new combinations of existing treatments in clinical trials. One trial is comparing a standard treatment (chemoradiation followed by combination chemotherapy) with chemoradiation followed by combination chemotherapy that includes an additional chemotherapy drug. The goal is to find out whether the additional chemotherapy drug may increase the likelihood of the cancer responding and possibly avoid the need for surgery. Approximately 5% of colorectal cancer cases are due to Lynch syndrome, an inherited DNA repair disorder. People with this disorder have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer, typically before they reach the age of 50. Lynch syndrome colorectal cancer tumors have many mutations, which may make them more susceptible to immunotherapies. A genetic feature known as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) is seen in about 15% of patients with stages II and III colorectal cancer and about 5% with stage IV. MSI-H means that there are mistakes in the way the DNA is copied in cancer cells, which can make them grow out of control. The immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab (Opdivo), ipilimumab (Yervoy), and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) have all been approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in patients with Lynch syndrome and in patients with MSI-H cancers. The NCI-sponsored COMMIT study is testing the addition of atezolizumab (Tecentriq) to the combination of chemotherapy and the targeted therapy bevacizumab (Avastin), for treating patients that have defective DNA mismatch repair. The hope is that combining drugs that work in different ways will improve treatment results in patients with colorectal cancer. Another NCI-sponsored trial is studying whether atezolizumab will improve outcomes in people with earlier-stage disease (specifically, stage III colon cancer) that is deficient in DNA mismatch repair. This trial will compare combination chemotherapy with or without atezolizumab. For people with locally advanced rectal cancer who have MSI-H cancer, one trial is studying the effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab when given together with short-course radiation therapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been less effective in colorectal cancer patients without Lynch syndrome and whose cancers don't have mismatch repair deficiency. Scientists are currently testing various agents, such as chemotherapy drugs, targeted therapies and viruses, in combination with immune-based therapy to determine whether combining treatments would be effective in killing cancer cells. Using targeted therapies against genetic mutations that may drive tumor growth is another key area of research for metastatic colorectal cancer. The goal is to find agents that can block the activity of the abnormal proteins produced by these mutations. For example: The drug encorafenib (Braftovi), which targets the BRAF protein, is approved for the treatment of some patients with colorectal cancer. This drug is used in combination with cetuximab (Erbitux) in adults with metastatic colorectal cancer whose tumors have a certain mutation in the BRAF gene and who have already undergone treatment.  An NCI-supported trial showed that colorectal cancer that contains mutations in the BRAF gene responds to treatment with the drug vemurafenib (Zelboraf) in combination with cetuximab and irinotecan (Camptosar). Vermurafentib targets mutant B-Raf proteins when combined with these two drugs.  The NCI-sponsored SOLARIS trial is testing the addition of vitamin D3 to the combination of chemotherapy and bevacizumab for treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.  In January 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the combination of two targeted drugs, tucatinib (Tukysa) and trastuzumab (Herceptin) for people with advanced colorectal cancer that produces an excess amount of a protein called HER2. (3% or less of people with advanced colorectal cancer have tumors that overexpress this protein.) In the clinical trial that led to the approval, called MOUNTAINEER, more than one third of people who received the drug combination had their tumors shrink or disappear. For another third, tumors stopped growing for some time.  Liquid biopsies are a promising new approach being explored to detect, analyze, and track DNA, cells, and other substances shed from tumors into bodily fluids, such as blood and urine. Scientists are testing this method to detect colorectal cancer early, measure treatment responses, identify treatment resistance, and monitor for disease recurrence. One example is the COBRA trial, which found that testing blood for fragments of genetic material (DNA) shed by tumors, known as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), could identify patients with stage IIA colon cancer who might benefit from additional treatment with chemotherapy after surgery. An ongoing trial is studying ctDNA in people with stage II or III colon cancer. The goal is to determine whether and what type of chemotherapy will benefit patients who have had surgery for their colon cancer based on the presence or absence of ctDNA. Many NCI-funded researchers at the NIH campus, and across the United States and world, are seeking ways to address colorectal cancer more effectively. Some research is basic, exploring questions as diverse as the biological underpinnings of cancer and the social factors that affect cancer risk. And some is more clinical, seeking to translate this basic information into improving patient outcomes. The programs listed below are a small sampling of NCI’s research efforts for colorectal cancer. The NCI-supported genetic study, ENLACE, aims to learn more about colorectal cancer in people of Hispanic and Latino descent, with the ultimate goal of improving treatments for this population group. To achieve this, scientists are also testing ways to engage more people from this group in cancer research.  The Population-based Research to Optimize the Screening PRocess (PROSPR) is an NCI-supported network conducting research to better understand how to improve the entire cancer screening process (recruitment, screening, diagnosis, referral for treatment) for lung, colorectal, and cervical cancer in community healthcare settings.  Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening and Follow-Up Through Implementation Science (ACCIS) is intended to promote research in colorectal cancer screening, follow-up, referral-to-care and best practices for how multilevel interventions can be scaled-up in regions of the United States where screening rates are below national standards.  Approaches to Identify and Care for Individuals with Inherited Cancer Syndromes are studies designed to increase screening, prevention, and early treatment of people at high risk of cancer due to an inherited genetic susceptibility.  The NCI-funded Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) has established an international cohort of thousands of colorectal cancer patients, their relatives, and individuals at increased risk of colorectal and other cancers. Over 10,000 families from the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have been registered. The database includes more than 2,000 individuals with Lynch syndrome, from 781 families.  The goal of the Screen to Save Initiative, funded by NCI’s Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities, is to increase colorectal cancer screening in areas that need it most. Through community health educators, the program provides education and outreach to increase access to resources for those who may be affected by colorectal cancer.  Dissemination of a Colorectal Cancer Screening Program Across American Indian Communities in the Southern Plains and Southwest United States is an effort to increase the use of colorectal cancer screening tests in American Indians. This project supports research on system-level changes and culturally appropriate media to promote screening, with the goal of closing the gap in colorectal cancer outcomes between the American Indian population and the general US population.  NCI's Gastrointestinal (GI) SPOREs focus on translational research in the gastrointestinal system. Currently, GI SPOREs focus on cancers of the colon, rectum, esophagus, liver, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and pancreas, which account for the majority of new diagnoses.  NCI funds and oversees both early- and late-phase clinical trials to develop new treatments and improve patient care. Trials are available for colorectal cancer screening, to prevent colon and rectal cancer, and treatment for colon cancer and rectal cancer.

Rhabdoid tumor is a type of tumor that is made up of many large cells. Some rhabdoid tumors can grow in the brain, and these are called atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRT). Most often, they grow in the kidneys and other soft tissues, like the muscles attached to the bones of the skeleton. Rhaboid tumors that grow outside of the brain are called extra-cranial malignant rhabdoid tumor, malignant rhabdoid tumor, or MRT. MRTs grow and spread to other parts of the body quickly. MRT is very rare. Some studies estimate that less than one person for every one million people has this type of rare tumor. It is most common in babies between 11 and 18 months old. MRTs sometimes look like other tumors. Doctors use a few different tests to diagnose MRT. Imaging: Doctors use imaging scans such as MRI, ultrasound, and CT to get a look at where the tumor is in the body and how big it is. Biopsy: To check if the tumor is MRT, your child’s doctor will do a biopsy, taking a small sample from the tumor with a needle. An expert, called a pathologist, will study cells from the sample under the microscope to see what kind of tumor it is. They may also test the cells to see if there are changes in the gene called SMARCB1. Almost all rhabdoid tumors have changes in the SMARCB1 gene. Studies have shown that using many different types of treatments can be better at killing the tumor cells than one treatment alone. Surgery: Surgery is used to remove as much of the cancer as possible. Sometimes, doctors can remove the entire tumor in one piece. Radiation Therapy: Radiation therapy uses radiation to kill tumor cells and shrink the tumor. High Dose Chemotherapy: High dose chemotherapy uses drugs to kill the fast-growing tumor cells. This may have side effects. No, MRT does not run in families. We know that in most cases of MRT, there is a change in the DNA in a gene called SMARCB1, so it may be very important for how these tumors form. Scientists are trying to figure out how this works so they can invent new treatments. The estimate of how a disease will affect you long-term is called prognosis. Every person is different and prognosis will depend on many factors, such as: Where the tumor is in your body  If the cancer has spread to other parts of your body  How much of the tumor was taken out during surgery  If you want information on your child’s prognosis, it is important to talk to your child’s doctor. NCI also has resources to help you understand cancer prognosis. The prognosis of children with MRT is very poor. Although there are a few cases of long-term survival, most children do not live longer than a few years. Children diagnosed after the age of 2 tend to have a better prognosis than those who are diagnosed when they are younger. Keep in mind that doctors estimate MRT survival rates by how groups of children with these tumors have done in the past. Because there are so few children with MRT, these rates may not be very accurate. It is very important to work with a team of experts as soon as possible after diagnosis to improve your child’s chances of survival. You can contact MyPART for help connecting with experts in MRT.

Partnerships   Clinical Studies  Referrals  Partnerships  This research project intends to answer the one question that plagues most patients: Why did this happen to me? We are expanding the work of our successful Ependymoma Outcomes Surveys to improve our understanding of risk factors associated with the occurrence of rare central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Research has shown that certain risk factors may increase a person’s chances of developing cancer. Factors can include exposure to chemicals or other substances, as well as personal and family medical history. Participating in the Rare CNS Tumors Outcomes and Risk study will help pave the path toward improving our understanding of risk factors associated with the occurrence of rare CNS tumors. The Outcomes and Risk Study is designed for adults diagnosed with a rare CNS tumor. If you take part in this study, we will ask you to complete online surveys and submit a saliva sample that will be used for genetic testing to evaluate risk factors, and you may choose to submit medical records related to your rare CNS tumor. The Outcomes and Risk Study is designed for adults diagnosed with rare CNS tumors. We designed the instructions for participation to be as simple and straightforward as possible. Efforts like this would not be possible without the selfless contributions of patients like you. Temporarily Closed to Enrollment. Click on the link for the Rare CNS Tumors Outcomes and Risk Enrollment Form.  You will be sent a consent form through a secure email. The study coordinator will set up a time with you to go over the consent information, either over the telephone or using other NIH-approved platforms, after you have read the consent form. Once you complete the consent form and send it back to the coordinator, you will be contacted with instructions to complete the Rare CNS Tumors Outcomes Survey and the Rare CNS Tumors Risk Survey. You will be provided a unique link that you will use to complete the surveys.  Once the surveys are completed, a medical records request form will be emailed to you, if you want to submit your medical records. You will also be mailed a copy of your signed consent form for your files and a study kit to collect saliva for germline DNA. Germline DNA is the source of DNA for all cells in the body. Your blood and tissue samples contain genes that are made up of DNA, which serves as the "instruction book" for the cells that make up our bodies. Genome sequencing will determine the exact order of the base pairs (chemical letters) in your blood. Your sample(s) and survey responses will help us study how genes and suspected risk factors are associated with the occurrence of rare CNS tumors. Instructions on how to collect the sample and a self-addressed, postage-paid, padded envelope will be provided for you to return the sample to us.  Aggregate results of the surveys will be shared (anonymously on the NCI-CONNECT website and shared with our advocacy partners) and by publication in peer-reviewed journals.  Please note: Internet access is required for enrollment in the study and completion of all data collection forms. The Enrollment Form is housed at a separate and secure website called surveymonkey.com. By clicking on either enrollment forms, you will be directed to this secure third-party site. The Rare CNS tumors Risk Survey and the Rare CNS tumors Outcomes Survey are housed on a separate NIH secure server. Enrollment Form: A brief survey designed to capture demographic data. Completion time is approximately 5-10 minutes.  Rare CNS Tumors Outcomes Survey: Detailed surveys designed to capture data on treatment information and quality of life issues of rare CNS tumors patients. Participants will be contacted via email or physical mail once the completed enrollment form is received. Completion time is approximately 50 minutes for each participant. If you have any questions about this process, you are welcome to contact the study team at NCINOB_ROSTeam@mail.nih.gov.  Rare CNS Tumors Risk Survey: The survey will be completed only once by you (or with the help of a proxy if physical limitations prevent you from completing online forms) via Scribe. For example, if you have visual or motor problems that make it difficult to see the questionnaire or manually use the computer to type your responses, a proxy can help you complete the survey. Questions include demographic information, personal medical history, family medical history, and environmental exposures. This should take about 45-60 minutes. If you have any questions about this process, you are welcome to contact the study team at NCINOB_ROSTeam@mail.nih.gov.   Updated:

Meetings & Events  Dialogue on Disparities   Mission  What We Do & Future Goals  Programs & Initiatives  Contact & Staff Bios  Offices and Branches  Meetings & Events  The cancer research community is charged with a remarkable challenge. Not only do we conduct research on the underlying causes, prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of disparities in cancer, but we must ensure this research improves cancer outcomes for everyone. The truth is some population groups are not benefiting from the substantial strides in cancer research and treatment. For example, African Americans have the highest death rate and shortest survival of any racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. for most cancers. Cancer is also the number one killer of Hispanics and Latinos and Asian American women. As the director of the Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CRCHD) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), I’m committed to exploring the whole gamut of cancer health disparities (CHD) and believe it is not only important to research disparities, but it is equally critical to diversify the biomedical workforce and better align culturally sensitive interventions with diverse communities. During the summer of 2014, we held our annual Program Meetings to assess our progress and take stock to see what is working and what is not. We’ve accomplished a lot together in the past year. Our principal initiatives are driven by aims to diversify the cancer research workforce, develop and conduct studies that provide a more precise picture of the biological roots of cancer disparities, strengthen partnerships within regions, and help researchers think about their work in a broader context and ensure that the community is engaged in all aspects of the research process. But, there’s still much work to be done. At our Continuing Umbrella of Cancer Research Experiences (CURE) Professional Development Workshop, 90 of our young investigators and CURE scholars, across academic and investigator levels, had an opportunity to network and share research highlights in basic science, community-based participatory research, and clinical research. The two-day workshop is just one of the scientific training opportunities that the CURE program offers. The CURE scholars observed and participated in a mock grant review, and practiced their presentation skills during a scientific poster session. The interactive presentations and discussions at the Partnerships to Advance Cancer Health Equity (PACHE) meeting was focused on the future of the program and how members can continue to work together to build research and training capacities at underrepresented-serving institutions, as well as enhance outreach to racially and ethnically diverse communities. The participants discussed ways to grow and strengthen training opportunities in cancer and cancer health disparities research, as well as enhance professional development and increase networking among partnership-supported researchers, trainees, and program staff to help secure future scientific collaborations. Read more about the 2014 PACHE program meeting. Over 70 community-based researchers and program staff members gathered at the Community Networks Program Center (CNPC) annual program meeting to report on the progress of pilot and full research projects. Aimed at bringing cancer prevention and control strategies to underserved communities (where such efforts are desperately needed), CNPC participants openly shared innovative and effective ways to engage and reach underserved communities with cancer advances. Everyone agreed that solutions to cancer health disparities can frequently be found in the communities themselves, and that gaining the trust and buy-in of the community is essential to this kind of research. At the National Outreach Network (NON) Program Meeting, participating Community Health Educators (CHEs) pointed to more effective ways of reaching culturally diverse and at-risk communities–to motivate individuals to seek cancer prevention and screening services that can save their lives. Participating CHEs also stressed that integration within their parent institution and the communities they serve were critical to the success of their outreach efforts, and they shared ideas on how to strengthen linkages across the national, regional, and local levels so all can be unified in the fight to end CHD.

What happens if a colorectal cancer screening test finds an abnormality? What new tests are being developed for colorectal cancer screening? What is colorectal cancer? Colorectal cancer (cancer that develops in the colon and/or the rectum) is a disease in which abnormal cells in the colon or rectum divide uncontrollably, ultimately forming a malignant tumor. Parts of the colon. Drawing of the front of the abdomen that shows the four sections of the colon: the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon. Also shown are the small intestine, the cecum, and the rectum. The cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal make up the large intestine. The cecum, ascending colon, and transverse colon make up the upper, or proximal, colon; the descending colon and sigmoid colon make up the lower, or distal, colon. Most colorectal cancers begin as a growth, or lesion, in the tissue that lines the inner surface of the colon or rectum. Lesions may appear as raised polyps, or, less commonly, they may appear flat or slightly indented. Raised polyps may be attached to the inner surface of the colon or rectum with a stalk (pedunculated polyps), or they may grow along the surface without a stalk (sessile polyps). Colorectal polyps are common in people older than 50 years of age, and most do not become cancer. However, a certain type of polyp known as an adenoma is more likely to become a cancer. Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of non-skin cancer in both men (after prostate cancer and lung cancer) and women (after breast cancer and lung cancer). It is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States after lung cancer. In 2021, an estimated 149,500 people in the United States will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 52,980 people will die from it (1). Who is at risk for colorectal cancer? In the United States, colorectal cancer is most common in adults aged 65 to 74. Rates of new colorectal cancer cases are decreasing among adults aged 50 years or older due to an increase in screening and to changes in some risk factors (for example, a decline in smoking) (2). However, incidence is increasing among younger adults (2–4) for reasons that are not known. An analysis of US population-based cancer registry data from NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program for 2000 to 2014 shows that, each year over this period, the incidence of colorectal cancer increased 2.7% among 20- to 39-year-olds and 1.7% among 40- to 49-year-olds while decreasing 0.5% among 50- to 59-year-olds, 3.3% among 60- to 69-year-olds, and 3.8% among 70- to 79-year-olds (5). Although the percentage increases were higher in the younger age groups than the older age groups, fewer colorectal cancers were still diagnosed in younger people than older people (for example, for 2000 to 2014, 22.5 colorectal cancers were diagnosed per 100,000 people aged 40 to 49 years, compared with 128.6 colorectal cancers diagnosed per 100,000 people aged 60 to 69 years). The major risk factors for colorectal cancer are older age and having certain inherited conditions (such as Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis), but several other factors have also been associated with increased risk, including a family history of the disease, excessive alcohol use, obesity, being physically inactive, cigarette smoking, and, possibly, diet. In addition, people with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease) have a higher risk of colorectal cancer than people without such conditions. What methods are used to screen people for colorectal cancer? Several screening tests have been developed to help doctors find colorectal cancer before symptoms begin, when it may be more treatable. Some tests also allow adenomas and polyps to be removed before they become cancer. That is, colorectal cancer screening may be a form of cancer prevention in addition to early detection. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) considers the following methods to be acceptable screening tests for colorectal cancer: Stool tests. Both polyps and colorectal cancers can bleed, and stool tests check for tiny amounts of blood in feces (stool) that cannot be seen visually. (Blood in stool may also indicate the presence of conditions that are not cancer, such as hemorrhoids.) 
	Currently, three types of stool tests are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to screen for colorectal cancer: guaiac FOBT (gFOBT); the fecal immunochemical (or immunohistochemical) test (FIT, also known as iFOBT); and multitargeted stool DNA testing (also known as FIT-DNA). With these tests, stool samples are collected by the patient using a kit, and the samples are returned to the doctor. People who have a positive finding with these tests are advised to have a colonoscopy.
	 
	gFOBT uses a chemical to detect heme, a component of the blood protein hemoglobin. Because gFOBT can also detect heme in some foods (for example, red meat), people must avoid certain foods before having this test.
FIT uses antibodies to detect hemoglobin protein specifically (5, 6). Dietary restrictions are typically not required for FIT.
FIT-DNA detects hemoglobin, along with certain DNA biomarkers. The DNA comes from cells in the lining of the colon and rectum that are shed and collect in stool as it passes through the large intestine and rectum.
		 

	Randomized trials have shown that gFOBT, when performed every 1 to 2 years in people aged 50 to 80 years, can help reduce the number of deaths due to colorectal cancer (7, 8). Newer studies have shown that FIT can detect more colorectal cancers than gFOBT (that is, it is more sensitive) (9). If gFOBT or FIT is the only type of colorectal cancer screening test performed, experts generally recommend testing every year or two (10). 
	In one study of people who were at average risk of developing colon cancer and had no symptoms of colon problems (11), the FIT-DNA test was more sensitive than the FIT test. However, the FIT-DNA test also was more likely to identify an abnormality when none was actually present (that is, it had more false-positive results, which can lead to unnecessary colonoscopies). Experts generally suggest FIT-DNA testing at least every 3 years (6).  Sigmoidoscopy. In this test, the rectum and sigmoid colon are examined using a sigmoidoscope, a flexible lighted tube with a lens for viewing and a tool for removing tissue. This instrument is inserted through the anus into the rectum and sigmoid colon as air is pumped into the colon to expand it so the doctor can see the colon lining more clearly. During sigmoidoscopy, abnormal growths in the rectum and sigmoid colon can be removed for analysis (biopsied). The lower colon must be cleared of stool before sigmoidoscopy, but the preparation is not very extensive. People are usually not sedated for this test.
	Clinical trials have shown that having sigmoidoscopy lowers the risks of developing and dying from colorectal cancer (12–16). Experts generally recommend sigmoidoscopy every 5 or 10 years for people at average risk who have had a negative test result (10). People who are screened with sigmoidoscopy may also be tested every few years with FIT.  Colonoscopy. In this test, the rectum and entire colon are examined using a colonoscope, a flexible lighted tube with a lens for viewing and a tool for removing tissue. Like the shorter sigmoidoscope, the colonoscope is inserted through the anus into the rectum and the colon as air is pumped into the colon to expand it so the doctor can see the colon lining more clearly. During colonoscopy, any abnormal growths in the entire colon and the rectum can be removed. The preparation for colonoscopy requires a thorough cleansing of the entire colon before the test. Most patients receive some form of sedation during the test.
	A meta-analysis of six observational studies reported that screening with colonoscopy substantially reduces the risks of developing and dying from colorectal cancer (17). Experts recommend colonoscopy every 10 years for people at average risk as long as their test results are negative. Virtual colonoscopy, also called computed tomographic (CT) colonography, is a screening method that uses special x-ray equipment (a CT scanner) to produce a series of pictures of the colon and the rectum from outside the body. A computer then assembles these pictures into detailed images that can show polyps and other abnormalities. As with standard colonoscopy, a thorough cleansing of the colon is necessary before this test. If polyps or other abnormal growths are found during a virtual colonoscopy, a standard colonoscopy must usually be performed to remove them. 
	Because virtual colonoscopy also produces images of areas outside the colon and rectum it can lead to the unintentional discovery of medical findings in these areas that require additional follow-up procedures. Virtual colonoscopy may also miss small polyps (18). However, many small polyps may not be likely to become cancer and so taking them out may not be of benefit.  Other methods. Several other tests to screen for colorectal cancer exist, although these are not generally recommended. Blood-based DNA test (liquid biopsy). A blood test for an altered gene called SEPT9 is FDA approved to be used to screen adults 50 years or older at average risk for colorectal cancer who have been offered and have a history of not completing colorectal cancer screening. There is no evidence yet that this test can reduce deaths from colorectal cancer.Double-contrast barium enema (DCBE). This test is another method of visualizing the colon from outside the body. In DCBE, a series of x-ray images of the entire colon and rectum is taken after the patient is given an enema with a barium solution. The barium helps to outline the colon and the rectum on the images. DCBE is rarely used for colorectal cancer screening; however, it may be used for people who cannot undergo standard colonoscopy—for example, because they are at particular risk for complications.Single-specimen gFOBT done in a doctor's office. Doctors sometimes perform a single-specimen gFOBT on a stool sample collected during a digital rectal examination as part of a routine physical examination. However, this approach has not been shown to be an effective way to screen for colorectal cancer (19).  gFOBT uses a chemical to detect heme, a component of the blood protein hemoglobin. Because gFOBT can also detect heme in some foods (for example, red meat), people must avoid certain foods before having this test.  FIT uses antibodies to detect hemoglobin protein specifically (5, 6). Dietary restrictions are typically not required for FIT.  FIT-DNA detects hemoglobin, along with certain DNA biomarkers. The DNA comes from cells in the lining of the colon and rectum that are shed and collect in stool as it passes through the large intestine and rectum.  What do colorectal cancer screening guidelines say about who should have colorectal cancer screening? New study suggests screening in people over age 75 lessens their risk of dying from this cancer. Expert medical groups, including the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (6), strongly recommend screening for colorectal cancer. Although some details of the recommendations vary, most groups now generally recommend that people at average risk of colorectal cancer get screened at regular intervals beginning at age 45 or 50 (6, 10, 20–22). The expert medical groups generally recommend that screening continue to age 75; for those aged 76 to 85 years, the decision to screen is based on the individual’s life expectancy, health conditions, and prior screening results. People who are at increased risk of colorectal cancer because of a family history of colorectal cancer or documented advanced polyps or because they have inflammatory bowel disease or certain inherited conditions (such as Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis) may be advised to start screening earlier and/or have more frequent screening. How can people and their health care providers decide which colorectal cancer screening test(s) to use? It is important to have colorectal cancer screening. Different tests have different advantages and disadvantages, and people should talk with their health care provider about which test is best for them. An individual's decision about which test to have may depend on: the person’s age, medical history, family history, and general health  potential harms of the test  the preparation required for the test  whether sedation may be needed for the test  the follow-up care needed after the test  the convenience of the test  the cost of the test and the availability of insurance coverage  The table below summarizes key features of the different colorectal screening tests that people may want to consider when choosing a test. Follow-up colonoscopy will likely be needed if test is positive  Abnormal tissue can be removed during exam  Very small risk of tearing or perforation of the lining of the colon  Not widely available in United States (23)  Abnormal tissue can be removed during exam  Small risk of tearing or perforation of the lining of the colon  Follow-up colonoscopy will likely be needed if test is positive  Not widely available and may not be covered by insurance  Can find abnormalities outside the colon that may need follow-up  Involves exposure to small amount of radiation  Does health insurance pay for colorectal cancer screening? Colorectal cancer screening is a preventive service that the Health Insurance Marketplace and many other health plans are required to cover. Medicare covers several colorectal cancer screening tests for its beneficiaries. However, Medicare and some insurance companies currently do not pay for the costs of virtual colonoscopy. Specific information about Medicare benefits for colorectal cancer screening is available on the Medicare website. A colonoscopy to follow up on a screening test with a positive result, such as an abnormal stool test or even a lesion detected on a screening colonoscopy, is considered to be a diagnostic exam and may not be covered (or not covered as fully as a screening colonoscopy). Some insurers consider a screening colonoscopy that reveals a polyp that must be removed to be a diagnostic exam and charge accordingly. People should check with their health insurance provider to determine their colorectal cancer screening coverage and what their out-of-pocket expenses may be if the test finds an abnormality that needs to be followed up. What happens if a colorectal cancer screening test finds an abnormality? If a screening test finds an abnormality (a lesion or tumor), additional tests may be needed. These tests most often include a colonoscopy if it has not already been done, such as in the case of stool blood testing. If an abnormality is found during sigmoidoscopy, a biopsy or polypectomy may be performed during the test, and a follow-up colonoscopy may be recommended. If an abnormality is found during a standard colonoscopy, a biopsy or polypectomy may be performed during the test to determine whether cancer is present. If an abnormality is detected during virtual colonoscopy, the patient will be referred for a standard colonoscopy. What new tests are being developed for colorectal cancer screening? Among new approaches to colorectal cancer screening that are being explored are ways to improve visualization of the colon. One technique is capsule colonoscopy (also called capsule endoscopy), in which a person swallows a pill-like capsule that contains a tiny wireless camera. The camera takes pictures of the inside of the digestive tract and sends them to a small recorder that is worn on the patient’s waist or shoulder. The pictures are then viewed on a computer by the doctor to check for signs of disease. The capsule passes out of the body during a bowel movement. Cleansing of the colon is still necessary before this test. This method is currently approved for patients with an incomplete colonoscopy and for detection of colon polyps in patients with evidence of lower GI bleeding but not as a stand-alone screening test. One new approach to colorectal cancer screening is to look for cells released by colorectal polyps and tumors into the bloodstream (24). These so-called circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are rare, however. Researchers have developed an ultrasensitive antibody-linked CTC detection technology to capture colorectal epithelial cells associated with colorectal tumors and adenomas in blood samples (25). In a proof-of-concept study, this blood-based CTC test was able to distinguish between patients with colorectal adenomas or cancer and people without cancer (26). Researchers have also identified small molecules, called metabolites, in urine that may signal the presence of colorectal polyps and tumors (27, 28). In a clinical study, a metabolomic-based urine test was better able to identify patients with adenomas than stool-based tests (29). Researchers are also trying to improve the sensitivity of stool-based screening for detecting advanced adenomatous polyps, which can potentially become colorectal cancer, by testing for the presence of multiple biomarkers. For example, measuring three protein biomarkers in stool—hemoglobin, calprotectin, and serpin family F member 2—improved the ability of FIT to detect advanced lesions (including colorectal cancer) by 35% without reducing its specificity (30). Information about ongoing clinical trials that are studying methods for colorectal cancer screening can be found in NCI’s clinical trials database.

USC Norris’s vision is to reduce the burden of cancer for all people. The center’s location in the fourth most diverse city in the United States provides an opportunity and a mandate to lead in research that addresses the cancer-related needs and cancer disparities among diverse communities and special populations. To realize this vision, USC Norris members are organized into five multidisciplinary research programs spanning from basic science to translational and clinical science and population science. These highly collaborative programs of laboratory, clinical, and population-based research drive scientific discoveries and foster translation to the clinic and community. USC Norris’s cancer training programs are part of the fabric of these efforts, creating a diverse pipeline for the next generation of cancer scientists and clinicians, while its Office of Community Outreach and Engagement is the vehicle by which they understand, engage, and serve the needs of the underserved communities in Los Angeles county and beyond. USC Norris members are organized into five transdisciplinary research programs: Tumor Microenvironment, Genomic and Epigenomic Regulation, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Cancer Epidemiology, and Cancer Control Research. Through Disease-Specific Research Affinity Groups, scientists across the continuum of cancer research collaborate with Clinical Disease Teams to apply new knowledge to address important cancer problems and ultimately to change the paradigm of cancer prevention and cancer care. Selected transformative achievements include the following. Basic Science: USC Norris has recently: developed a novel treatment for patients with precervical cancer based on laboratory research  discovered a major role for activated natural killer cells in combination with certain antibodies  validated two novel approaches to aid the development of new cellular therapies for blood cancers, and development of a new cell therapy–based platform technology that is as effective  as the Food and Drug Administration approved treatment for B-cell lymphoma, but with limited toxicity  discovered that DNA methylation inhibitors kill cancer cells by evoking an antiviral response and validation of antiviral response markers to predict leukemia patient response to these treatments  analyzed how the protein GRP78 escapes to the cancer cell surface to drive cancer cell survival, leading to a novel drug development platform.  Translational and Clinical Sciences: Key recent translational discoveries include: discovery of novel immunological mechanisms of EphB4/EphrinB2 signaling leading to phase 1 and 2 trials  advancement of the Artemis study as a novel therapeutic target through NCI NeXT with lead compound optimization for acute myelogenous leukemia  development of a novel combination of epigenetic inhibitors and immunotherapies for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers  validation of novel circulating biomarker methods including liquid biopsy RNA studies for monitoring prostate cancer clinical outcomes and cell free DNA methylation assays for early detection of occult cancer following adjuvant treatment in breast cancer  molecular classification of colon cancer including the discovery of novel mutations as a predictive and prognostic biomarker.  Population Science: Leveraging the NCI-funded Cancer Surveillance Program and Multi-Ethnic Cohort, population scientists have made impactful discoveries to reduce cancer disparities: identified novel genomic and environmental risk factors for prostate cancer, breast cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in different racial/ethnic groups  developed a multiethnic polygenic risk score for aggressive prostate cancer that is being translated to a clinical trial  established elevated risk of pancreatic cancer among African Americans and Latinos with late-onset diabetes  linked e-cigarette use with initiation of combustible tobacco products in teens and documented the respiratory effects of e-cigarette use  developed and disseminated novel school-based skin cancer prevention and HPV vaccination interventions among underserved communities.  Cancer Disparities: The catchment area of Los Angeles County includes a diverse population defined by race/ethnicity, as well as age, immigration status, acculturation, socioeconomic status, language, and access to health services. USC Norris leverages longitudinal data collected over 46 years from the NCI-funded Cancer Surveillance Program as well as expertise in spatial sciences/geographic information system mapping to monitor and assess progress in reducing disparities in the catchment area. Given strengths in basic and population-based disparities in pediatric cancers, adolescent and young adult, and adult cancers, they examine disparities within a lifespan approach. USC Norris is also developing a Cancer Disparities Index to identify and monitor the cancer burden and identify contributors to cancer disparities in the catchment area, increase engagement of underserved individuals and populations in cancer disparities research, and broadly disseminate tools for a national impact on cancer disparities. Drug Development: Basic and translational research that leads to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in cancer development and progression fosters discovery and validation of novel targets and pathways by USC Norris investigators. USC Norris leaders identify and prioritize the most promising targets/pathways and drug candidates for testing in early preclinical and clinical models through a systematic process. Cross-functional teams of basic and translational/clinical scientists are advancing early-stage clinical trials with companion biomarkers, based upon these discoveries by USC Norris investigators. Through a major gift to create the Rosalie and Harold Rae Brown Center for Cancer Drug Discovery at USC Norris, they are addressing a critical unmet need in oncology that could lead to more effective and less toxic therapies. Initial projects are sharply focused on cancers that disproportionately affect members of the community for whom there are dramatic ethnic and racial disparities. Liquid Biopsies: USC Norris’s precision cancer efforts tailor treatment based upon each patient’s molecular tumor profile, but such profiles are sometimes difficult to generate from tumor biopsies because of access to the tumor and patient safety. Liquid biopsies offer an attractive alternative. This precision medicine approach utilizes sophisticated noninvasive blood samples to track and analyze patients’ tumors over time and with treatment. To address these critical needs, they founded the Liquid Biopsy Research Core at USC Norris in 2015, a state-of-the-art, multiplatform facility for the capture and analysis of all liquid biopsy components. Through serial liquid biopsies in patients with cancer, they study tumor cell evolution with treatment, enabling more rapid treatment adaptations to address treatment resistance and improve clinical outcomes. * This profile was provided by USC Norris.

 used in the development of the screening summaries.  Evaluating screening requires weighing risks and benefits.  Monetary cost and cost-effectiveness are not considered when evaluating the evidence.   Levels of
evidence are assigned when evaluating screening tests. In general, the benefit of cancer screening derives from detecting cancer in earlier and more treatable stages, and thereby, reducing mortality from cancer. In addition, for some cancer types and screening modalities, such as endoscopic screening for colorectal cancer and Papanicolaou (Pap) smears for cervical cancer, screening can also prevent the occurrence of cancer by identifying and removing cancer precursors. Screening may also reduce cancer morbidity when the treatment for earlier-stage cancer is associated with fewer side effects than the treatment for advanced cancers. Known harms from screening include the following:[1] The possibility of serious test-related complications, which may be immediate (e.g., perforation with colonoscopy) or delayed (e.g., potential carcinogenesis from radiation exposure). A false-positive screening test result, which may cause anxiety and lead to additional invasive diagnostic procedures. Overdiagnosis, which occurs when screening procedures detect cancers that would never become clinically apparent in the absence of screening. Overtreatment resulting from overdiagnosis. Because screening tests themselves are generally noninvasive, immediate harms from the test are typically minor. Colonoscopy is an exception in that it is an invasive test. It also functions as a diagnostic follow-up examination for other colorectal cancer screening modalities, such as a fecal occult blood (FOB) test. Commonly used screening tests, such as mammography for breast cancer and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer, have false-positive rates per screen in the range of 5% to 10%; with repeat screening, cumulative false-positive rates for these tests are substantially higher.[2-4] Follow-up invasive diagnostic procedures, such as a prostate biopsy, are associated with low but non-negligible risks of complications. For screening tests such as colonoscopy or Pap smears where precursor lesions, in addition to invasive cancer, are targets of the screen, the definition of a false positive is modified from simply a positive screen in an individual without cancer. For example, for cervical cancer screening, a positive Pap smear with an eventual diagnosis of high-grade intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) would not be considered a false positive, since HSIL is a target lesion. Overdiagnosis occurs when screening procedures detect cancers that would never become clinically apparent in the absence of screening. It is a special concern because identification of the cancer does not benefit the individual, while the side effects of diagnostic procedures and cancer treatment may cause significant harm.  The overall harm of overdiagnosis is related to both the frequency of its occurrence, as well as to the downstream consequences of subsequent treatment. For example, in prostate cancer screening with PSA, there is a high rate of overdiagnosed disease and the harms of curative treatment, including impotence and urinary incontinence, are relatively common, serious, and long-lasting. Therefore, overdiagnosis is a major source of harms in PSA screening.[5] Some of the harms of overdiagnosis may be mitigated by strategies, such as active surveillance in prostate cancer, that attempt to defer immediate treatment in favor of following patients for any signs of worsening prognosis. In general, overdiagnosis is more common in older individuals and those with otherwise limited life expectancy since the slowly growing lesions associated with overdiagnosed cancers have less time to become clinically apparent in such persons. Therefore, attempts have been made to discourage screening beyond certain age ranges; for example, most recommendations for mammography screening exclude women aged 75 or older and those with less than 10 years of life expectancy.[6] In developing the cancer screening summaries, the PDQ Screening and Prevention
Editorial Board uses the following definitions: Screening is a means of detecting disease early in asymptomatic people. Positive results of examinations, tests, or procedures may not be diagnostic but instead identify people who warrant further evaluation. Some positive screening tests require additional procedures, such as biopsies of the indicated organ. These may rule out cancer or confirm the diagnosis of cancer. The PDQ does not issue clinical practice guidelines.  Many public health organizations present guidelines for health care and screening activities. Their quality varies widely.  Some rely on systematic reviews of evidence of variable quality. Some are influenced by the professional, financial, and intellectual interests of guideline authors and funders. These may conflict with the primary interest—the overall well-being of the patient.[7-9] The highest quality guidelines as assessed by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) are those based on the best systematic reviews as evaluated using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR).

BMJ 346: f3830, 2013. [PUBMED Abstract] The cancer screening summaries are based on various levels of published
scientific evidence and collective clinical experience.  The highest level of
evidence is taken as mortality reduction in controlled, randomized clinical
trials.  The results of clinical studies, case-control studies, cohort studies,
and other information are also considered in formulating the summaries.  In
addition, the incidence of cancer, stage distribution, treatment, and mortality
rates are considered.  The summaries are subject to modification as new
evidence becomes available. There are at least two requirements for screening to be efficacious: The test or procedure must be able to detect some cancers earlier than if
the cancer were detected as a result of the development of symptoms. Treatment initiated earlier as a consequence of
screening must result in an improved outcome for at least some patients. These requirements are necessary but not sufficient to prove the efficacy of
screening, which requires a decrease in cause-specific mortality.  A cautionary tale is a Japanese screening program for childhood neuroblastoma
that detected malignancy in ten times as many infants as in unscreened populations. But, a randomized trial showed that it did not yield any improvement in cause-specific mortality.[1]  Other neuroblastoma screening projects confirmed the result.[2-4] Yamamoto K, Hayashi Y, Hanada R, et al.: Mass screening and age-specific incidence of neuroblastoma in Saitama Prefecture, Japan.

J Natl Cancer Inst 97 (15): 1118-24, 2005. [PUBMED Abstract] Direct or assisted visual observation is the most widely available examination
for the detection of cancer.  It is useful in identifying suspicious lesions in
the skin, retina, lip, mouth, external genitalia, and cervix. The second most available detection procedure is palpation   to detect  lumps, nodules, or tumors in the breast, mouth, salivary
glands, thyroid, subcutaneous tissues, anus, rectum, prostate, testes, ovaries
and uterus, and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, axilla, or groin. Internal cancers require procedures and tests such as endoscopy, x-rays,
magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound.  Laboratory tests, such as the Pap
smear or the FOB test have been employed for the detection of
specific cancers. Screening test performance is usually measured in terms of the following: Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test given that the person has cancer. Specificity is the probability of a negative test given that the person does not have cancer. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that the person has cancer given a positive test. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that the person does not have cancer given a negative test. PPV and NPV are related to sensitivity and specificity by Bayes rule, where prior probability is prevalence of disease in the population being screened. PPV and, to a lesser extent, NPV are affected by the prevalence of disease in the population being screened. For a given sensitivity and specificity, the lower the prevalence, the lower the PPV and the higher the NPV. The concepts of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV are complicated for blood tests that aim to detect many types of cancers from a single blood sample. These test are called multi-cancer detection (MCD) assays or multi-cancer early detection (MCED) assays. These concepts are addressed in the next section. Cancer is rare when considering all cancers collectively and not just those that have existing screening tests with sufficient evidence of benefit. People having a multi-cancer detection (MCD) screening test may not have detectable disease at the time of screening and, therefore, will not benefit from early detection by these assays. Performance characteristics of MCD assays, along with the resulting cascade of care, are not fully understood, and therefore, the opportunity for harms is much greater with these MCD assays within the framework of what we know about cancer screening. No MCD assay has been properly evaluated to show a mortality reduction in randomized clinical trials. Indeed, no such trials have been published. No MCD assay has been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, some MCD assays are being marketed as laboratory developed tests (LDTs). These are assays that are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. Marketing is allowed under federal regulations, known as Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Customers may be persuaded by the concept that earlier detection is good. It may be good, but there are also negative aspects. Potential negative aspects include overdiagnosis and false positives. For example, a test that detects cancer and indicates that it is most likely to be lung cancer is correct in a sense if the patient has cancer. But it is regarded to be a false positive unless the patient has lung cancer. These negative aspects may be  more concerning and more complicated with MCD assays than with screening tests for specific tumor types. The benefits and harms of MCD assays are impossible to determine in the absence of randomized clinical trials that have mortality as an end point. Cancer risk increases with advancing age, but some individuals have higher cancer risk, including the following:[1] Those with a personal or a strong family history of cancer, or those with inherited  genetic mutations and polymorphisms associated with specific cancers. Those who have been exposed to environmental or occupational carcinogens (asbestos, uranium miners). Personal behaviors related to cancer risk (smoking, alcohol consumption, sun exposure). Those who have been exposed to therapeutic radiation (especially if it occurred during childhood or adolescence). In general, the balance of benefits to harms is more favorable in higher risk individuals since they have a greater probability of benefiting from the screening while typically having a similar likelihood of experiencing the harms. Recommendations for screening, including the age to start and in some cases whether to screen at all, may differ by risk group. For example, lung cancer screening is recommended only for those with a substantial smoking history, and colorectal cancer screening is recommended to start at an earlier age for those with a family history of the disease. van Es N, Le Gal G, Otten HM, et al.: Screening for Occult Cancer in Patients With Unprovoked Venous Thromboembolism: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Individual Patient Data. Ann Intern Med 167 (6): 410-417, 2017. [PUBMED Abstract] For more information about the recurrence of specific types of cancer, see the PDQ summaries on Adult Treatment. For nearly all cancers, treatment options and survival are related to stage, characterized by the anatomical extent of disease, as defined by tumor size, invasion of lymph nodes, and distant metastases. It is assumed that  detection of cancer at an earlier stage yields better outcomes. However, the biologic cellular characteristics of cancer, such as grade, hormone sensitivity, and gene overexpression are also recognized as important predictors of cancer behavior. For example, high-grade cancer may be fast growing and quick to metastasize regardless of stage at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, detection of these cancers when they are small may not improve outcome. Randomized controlled trials are most definitive in determining screening benefits. Improvements in cancer survival over time are difficult to interpret, even when based on data from tumor registries, such as the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program that include all cases in a given population.  They may reflect the benefits of early detection or
improved treatment or both, but they may also result from lead-time bias and
overdiagnosis, both of which occur commonly with screening. Lead-time bias results
in longer estimated survival of  people with screen-identified cancers because the survival calculation includes the time preceding what would have been the clinical diagnosis of the cancer in the absence of screening. Overdiagnosis results from finding cancers that would never have become
manifest clinically. By definition, these tumors have 100% cancer-specific survival.  For example,
autopsy series of older men show a high percentage of occult early prostate carcinomas.[1]  The
increased discovery of these cancers through screening, or as incidental findings of tests performed for other purposes (e.g., computed tomography scans), increases the number of cases, gives the appearance of a stage shift, and results in improved survival and/or cure rates, without affecting cause-specific mortality in the population.  Examples of cancers with increased incidence, in recent decades, caused primarily by a rise in incidentally detected cases include renal and thyroid cancers.[2] An analysis of data
reported by the SEER Program between 1950 and 1996 for 20 major cancers found little correlation between changes in
5-year survival rates and changes in mortality rates.[3]  Thus, improvements in 5-year survival rates are largely due to earlier
diagnosis and to overdiagnosis.  Reductions in incidence rates
for late-stage tumors represent a better measure of decreased cancer mortality due to screening than do 5-year survival trends. Relative survival compares the observed all-cause survival of a cohort of cancer patients with the expected all-cause survival of a comparable (age-, sex-, and race-matched) population. The relative survival rates of patients with early-stage cancer may be inflated artifactually by a screening test because people who choose to be screened are often more health conscious than the general population, engaging in a range of healthy lifestyle behaviors in addition to screening.  For example, a report of SEER data showed a 10-year relative survival rate of more than 100% in patients with early-stage prostate, thyroid, and breast cancers, and ductal carcinoma in situ and melanoma.  These five tumors are frequently diagnosed by screening in the United States.[4] This phenomenon is sometimes termed healthy screenee bias.

JAMA Intern Med 180 (3): 461-463, 2020. [PUBMED Abstract] Findings from studies employing various study designs are used to support a given summary.  The
strongest design is the 
randomized controlled trial, although it is impractical to conduct
such a trial addressing every question in the field of screening.  For
each summary of evidence statement, the associated  strength of study designs is
listed.  There are five study designs that are generally used in judging the evidence. In order of strength of design, the five levels are as follows: Evidence obtained from  randomized
controlled trials. Evidence obtained from  nonrandomized controlled
trials. Evidence obtained from  cohort or case-control
studies. Evidence obtained from ecological and descriptive studies (e.g., international patterns studies, time series). Opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience, descriptive
studies, or reports of expert committees. Experimental trials are designed to correct for or eliminate the following biases: selection,
lead-time, length, and healthy volunteer.  The
highest level of evidence and greatest benefit would be mortality
reduction in a randomized controlled trial.  Such evidence is not available for many situations because of the sample size, expense, and duration required. Case-control and cohort studies provide indirect evidence for the effectiveness
of screening, but they can be limited by selection bias and healthy volunteer bias. For example, individuals who undergo screening have been shown to have lower mortality from causes unrelated to that screening than do those who did not undergo screening, likely caused by better overall health behavior profiles. Thus, observed differences in survival or mortality by screening history could be caused by these other factors and not the actual screening.[1] New screening modalities may identify more cancers but must be evaluated to determine whether their adoption produces a decrease in cancer-specific mortality versus an increase in lead time bias and overdiagnosis. While randomized trials can answer this question, they may be cost-prohibitive and impractical.[2] Ecological studies can demonstrate association between screening and improvement in cancer stage and survival, with the adoption of cervical cancer screening as an excellent example.[3]  Ecological studies are also valuable to assess the benefits of breast cancer screening, beyond the information gathered in randomized controlled studies, which were conducted over relatively short durations and in an era preceding major developments in cancer treatment. Descriptive uncontrolled studies on the basis of the experience of individual
physicians, hospitals, and non–population-based registries may yield useful
information.  The performance characteristics of various
detection tests, such as sensitivity, specificity, and PPVs are generally first reported in such descriptive studies.  The first
evidence that screening may be successful is an increase in the incidence of
early cancers and a decreased incidence of late-stage metastatic cancers
(stage shift); later, a reduction in deaths may occur.  These descriptive
studies do not establish efficacy because of the absence of an appropriate
control group and because they do not address the question whether early initiation of treatment affects patient outcomes (for more information about the Japanese neuroblastoma screening program, see the Potential Benefits and Harms section). The opinions of authorities may be useful, but may suffer the same weaknesses described earlier.

Another approach to formulating data about cancer screening is modeling. Models can generate information about cancer screening in circumstances where empiric evidence does not exist.  A number of probabilistic and computer simulation models have been developed to do the following: Analyze trends in cancer detection and compare these trends with those reported in national or regional databases. Investigate the cost-effectiveness of various screening strategies. Estimate overdiagnosis resulting from screening. Simulation modeling from the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) program is a major effort in this area.  Models have been developed to investigate the impact of screening for various cancers, as per the following examples: Changes in prostate cancer treatment, improvements in disease management after primary therapy, and screening are all factors in the observed decline in prostate cancer mortality.[1] The benefits and harms of eight breast cancer screening strategies are described,  including age differences at the start of screening (40, 45, or 50 years) and screening intervals (annual, biennial, or hybrid).[2] The benefits and harms of computed tomography lung cancer screening are examined, comparing 576 different scenarios with varying eligibility criteria (age, pack-years of smoking, years since quitting), screening intervals (1, 2, or 3 years), and the ages of starting (45, 50, 55, or 60 years) and stopping (75, 80, or 85 years) screening.[3] However, caution is necessary in interpreting model findings.  Models are only as good as the assumptions upon which they are based, particularly those assumptions about the natural history of the target disease.  Many models are complex, especially regarding the interaction of components and the generation of results, and multiple modeling efforts applied to the same screening scenario often give a wide range of quantitative results.   In addition, models often produce results that are extrapolations beyond the range of the data input to the models.

Unbiased and balanced information about the potential benefits and harms of cancer prevention, screening, and treatment plays an important role in the informed decision-making process by the patient. In a nationwide survey of informed decision-making during patient-provider discussions about colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer screening, patients considered themselves informed but often were not knowledgeable about the risks and benefits of screening. Patients reported that they were usually not asked about their preferences for cancer screening. Although more than 90% of the discussions addressed the advantages of screening, 30% or fewer addressed the disadvantages of screening.[1] For many cancer screening decisions, shared decision-making is suggested, whereby the provider helps the patient make an informed, values-based choice from among two or more medically reasonable alternatives.[2,3] This is especially important when screening presents potential harms and limited benefits. There are three components of shared decision-making:[4] The provider shares screening options with evidence-based information about benefits, harms, and uncertainties. The patient shares preferences with the provider, who helps the patient evaluate these options and preferences and make a decision. The provider assists with recording and implementing the patient’s preferences. Patient decision aids can be useful, as they encourage patients to interpret evidence in the context of their own goals and concerns and to make decisions with their physicians. Decision aids are available in leaflets, booklets, videos, and websites, and they may include patient stories. The International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration has developed a method for evaluating the quality of decision aids.[5] A Cochrane review of 115 randomized controlled trials of shared decision-making supported by decision aids indicated that, in general, decision aids improve patient knowledge about options and risks; reduce decisional conflict related to feeling uninformed or unclear about personal values; and stimulate patients to take more active roles in decision-making. In some cases, decision aids have also been noted to reduce the number of patients choosing major elective invasive surgery over more conservative options, and in fewer patients choosing cancer screening. The effect of using decision aids may lengthen or shorten the duration of the consultation.[6] After using a decision aid that included information about breast cancer overdetection, more women met the threshold for adequate overall knowledge about screening benefits and risks. Women whose decision aids included information about overdetection were less enthusiastic about screening and were less likely to participate.[7] Hoffman RM, Lewis CL, Pignone MP, et al.: Decision-making processes for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer screening: the DECISIONS survey.

randomized clinical trials of cancer screening, assumes that the cause of death can be
accurately determined and that the screening and subsequent treatments have
negligible effects on other causes of death.    By contrast, all-cause
mortality depends only on the date and accurate ascertainment of death. Because cancer deaths generally comprise only a small fraction of all deaths in a screening trial, the statistical power to detect a significant reduction in all-cause mortality in any single trial, or even in some meta-analyses, is typically low.  Nevertheless, all-cause mortality should be
considered in conjunction with disease-specific mortality to reduce the
possibility that a major effect from screening is hidden by
misclassification in cause of death.
The National Lung Screening Trial of low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening did demonstrate a significant reduction in all-cause mortality and a meta-analysis of flexible sigmoidoscopy trials also showed a significant all-cause mortality benefit.[1,2] In contrast, meta-analyses of mammography screening trials have failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in all-cause mortality.[3] Aberle DR, Adams AM, Berg CD, et al.: Reduced lung-cancer mortality with low-dose computed tomographic screening.

Ann Intern Med 164 (4): 244-55, 2016. [PUBMED Abstract] Several measures of risk are used in cancer research.  Absolute risk or absolute rate
measures the actual cancer risk or rate in a population or subgroup (e.g., U.S.
population, or White or Black individuals).    For example, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program reports risk and rate of cancer in specific
geographic areas of the United States. Rates are often adjusted (e.g., age-adjusted rates)  to allow a more accurate comparison of rates
over time or among groups.  The purpose of the adjustment is to make the groups
more alike with respect to important characteristics that may affect the
conclusions.  For example, when the SEER Program compares cancer rates over
time in the United States, the rates are adjusted to one age distribution because cancer rates are usually higher in older age
groups. Relative risk (RR) compares the risk of developing cancer among those who have
a particular characteristic or exposure with those who do not.  RR
is expressed as a ratio of risks or rates.  If the RR is one, the risk of both groups is the same; if the RR is greater than one, the exposure or
characteristic is associated with a higher cancer risk; if the
RR is less than  one, it is associated with a lower cancer
risk.  RR is often used in clinical trials of cancer prevention and
screening to estimate the reduction in cancer risk or risk of death,
respectively. An odds ratio (OR) is often used as an estimate of the RR.  It, too,
indicates whether there is an association between an exposure or characteristic
and cancer.  It compares the odds of an exposure or characteristic among cancer
cases with the odds among a comparison group without cancer. Uncertainty in an estimated OR (or RR) is sometimes presented as a confidence interval (CI), which represents the range of values for the OR (or RR) that is plausible based on the observed study data. If the CI range contains 1, it indicates that the observed data would not be unusual if the two groups truly do not differ in their odds (or risk) of experiencing the event. Risk or rate difference (or excess risk) compares the actual cancer risk or
rate among at least two groups of people, based on an important characteristic or
exposure, by subtracting the risks or rates from one another (e.g., subtracting
lung cancer rates among nonsmokers from that of cigarette smokers estimates the
excess risk of lung cancer due to smoking).  This can be used in public health
to estimate the number of cancer cases that could be avoided if an exposure
were reduced or eliminated in the population. Population-attributable risk measures the proportion of cancers that can be
attributed to a particular exposure or characteristic.  It combines information
about the RR of cancer associated with a particular exposure and the
prevalence of that exposure in the population, and estimates the proportion of
cancer cases in a population that could be avoided if an exposure were reduced
or eliminated. The number needed to screen (NNS) is a metric of screening efficiency defined as the number of people that must participate in
a screening program for  one death to be prevented over a defined time interval.
NNS estimates are typically derived from screening trial data. For screening modalities that can prevent cancer, as well as detect it earlier, such as endoscopic screening for colorectal cancer, an NNS to prevent one incident cancer is also a useful metric. Average life-years saved estimates the number of years of life that an intervention
saves, on average, for an individual who receives the intervention.  This
reflects mortality reduction and life extension (or avoidance of
premature deaths). When overdiagnosis occurs with screening, absolute and relative measures of risk calculated from studies with participants whose disease was screen-detected must be carefully interpreted. If the chance of diagnosis as a result of screening (either due to screening itself or diagnostic workup of a positive screen) is positively correlated with a given factor, risk measures will be inflated relative to those calculated from unscreened populations. The degree of inflation depends on prevalence of screening and the degree of correlation. As screening is adopted in population settings, trend data for risk will be affected similarly.[1] Many of the groundbreaking observational studies in cancer etiology were performed before cancer screening was widely adopted. Given the extensive uptake of screening for certain cancers, recently conducted observational etiologic studies include many participants whose disease was detected through screening. This may skew the results of these trials. For example, assume that men with blue eyes are more likely to participate in prostate-specific antigen screening and more willing to undergo prostate biopsy. Despite the absence of a biologic association between blue eyes and prostate cancer, more cancers will be detected in blue-eyed men because they are screened. Since many prostate cancers can be safely left undiagnosed and untreated, many of these cancers in blue-eyed men represent overdiagnosis. When overdiagnosis occurs due to screening, and when screening behavior or willingness to seek diagnostic evaluation is correlated with risk factors, relative risk measures generated from these studies may be over-stated and results may be misleading.

		  soft tissues of the body. Soft tissue sarcoma  occurs in  children and adults. Having certain diseases and inherited disorders can increase the risk of childhood soft tissue sarcoma. The most common sign of childhood soft tissue sarcoma is a painless lump or swelling in soft tissues of the body. Diagnostic tests are used to diagnose childhood soft tissue sarcoma. If tests show there may be a soft tissue sarcoma, a biopsy is done. There are many different types of soft tissue sarcomas. Fat tissue tumorsBone and cartilage tumorsFibrous (connective) tissue tumors Skeletal muscle tumorsSmooth muscle tumorsSo-called fibrohistiocytic tumorsNerve sheath tumorsPericytic (Perivascular) TumorsTumors of unknown cell originBlood vessel tumors Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Fat tissue tumors Bone and cartilage tumors Fibrous (connective) tissue tumors Skeletal muscle tumors Smooth muscle tumors So-called fibrohistiocytic tumors Nerve sheath tumors Pericytic (Perivascular) Tumors Tumors of unknown cell origin Blood vessel tumors Soft tissues of the body connect, support, and surround other body parts and organs. The soft tissue include the following: Fat. A mix of bone and cartilage. Fibrous tissue. Muscles. Nerves. Tendons (bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones). Synovial tissues (tissues around joints). Blood vessels. Lymph vessels. Soft tissue sarcoma may be found   anywhere in the body. In children, the tumors form most often in the arms, legs, chest, or abdomen.EnlargeSoft tissue sarcoma forms in the soft tissues of the body, including the muscles, tendons, ligaments, cartilage,  fat, blood vessels, lymph vessels, nerves, and tissues around joints. Soft tissue sarcoma in children may respond differently to treatment, and may have a better prognosis than soft tissue sarcoma in adults. (See  the PDQ summary on Soft Tissue Sarcoma for information on treatment in adults.) Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child’s doctor if you think your child may be at risk. Risk factors for childhood soft tissue sarcoma include having the following inherited disorders: Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). RB1 gene changes. SMARCB1 (INI1) gene changes. Neurofibromatosis type 1    (NF1). Werner syndrome. Tuberous sclerosis. Adenosine deaminase-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency. Other risk factors include the following: Past treatment with radiation therapy. Having  AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and  Epstein-Barr virus infection at the same time. A sarcoma may appear as a painless lump under the skin, often on an arm, a leg, the chest, or the abdomen.   There may be no other signs or symptoms at first. As the sarcoma gets bigger and presses on nearby organs, nerves, muscles, or blood vessels, it may cause signs or symptoms, such as pain or weakness. Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms. Check with your child’s doctor if your child has any of these problems. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and health history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. X-rays:  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body onto film, making pictures of areas inside the body. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the chest, abdomen, arms, or legs. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).EnlargeMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest or abdomen, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.EnlargeComputed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. The type of biopsy depends, in part, on the size of the mass and whether it is close to the surface of the skin or deeper in the tissue. One of the following types of biopsies is usually used: Core needle biopsy: The removal of tissue using a wide needle. Multiple tissue samples are taken. This procedure may be guided using ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. Incisional biopsy: The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue. Excisional biopsy: The removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesn’t look normal.  A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. An excisional biopsy may be used to completely remove smaller tumors that are near the surface of the skin. This type of biopsy is rarely used because cancer cells may remain after the biopsy. If cancer cells remain, the cancer may come back or it may spread to other parts of the body. An MRI of the tumor is done before the excisional biopsy. This is done to show where the original tumor formed and may be used to guide future surgery or radiation therapy. An MRI of the tumor is done before the excisional biopsy. This is done to show where the original tumor formed and may be used to guide future surgery or radiation therapy. If possible, the surgeon who will remove any tumor that is found should be involved in planning the biopsy. The placement of needles or incisions for the biopsy can affect  whether the whole tumor can be removed during later surgery. To plan the best treatment, the sample of tissue removed during the biopsy must be large enough to find out the type of soft tissue sarcoma and do other laboratory tests. Tissue samples will be taken from the  primary tumor, lymph nodes, and other areas that may have cancer cells. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells and to 

find out the type and grade of the tumor. The grade of a tumor depends on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cells are dividing. High-grade and mid-grade tumors usually grow and spread more quickly than low-grade tumors. Because soft tissue sarcoma can be hard to diagnose, the tissue sample should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing soft tissue sarcoma. One or more of the following laboratory tests may be done to study the tissue samples: Molecular test: A laboratory test to check for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules in a sample of tissue, blood, or other body fluid. A molecular test may be done with other procedures, such as biopsies, to help diagnose some types of cancer. Molecular tests check for certain gene or chromosome changes that occur in some soft tissue sarcomas. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) test: A laboratory test in which the amount of a genetic substance called mRNA made by a specific gene is measured. An enzyme called reverse transcriptase is used to convert a specific piece of RNA into a matching piece of DNA, which can be amplified (made in large numbers) by another enzyme called DNA polymerase. The amplified DNA copies help tell whether a specific mRNA is being made by a gene. RT–PCR can be used to check the activation of certain genes that may indicate the presence of cancer cells. This test may be used to look for certain changes in a gene or chromosome, which may help diagnose cancer. Cytogenetic analysis: A laboratory test in which the chromosomes of cells in a sample of tumor tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a type of cytogenetic analysis. Immunocytochemistry: A laboratory test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of a patient’s cells. The antibodies are usually linked to an enzyme or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to the antigen in the sample of the patient’s cells, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of soft tissue sarcoma. Light and electron microscopy: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells. The cells of each type of sarcoma look different under a microscope. The soft tissue tumors are grouped  based on the type of soft tissue cell where  they first formed. This summary is about the following types of soft tissue sarcoma: Liposarcoma. This is a cancer of the fat cells. Liposarcoma usually forms in the fat layer just under the skin. In children and   adolescents, liposarcoma is often low grade (likely to grow and spread slowly). There are several different types of liposarcoma, including: Myxoid liposarcoma. This is usually a low-grade cancer that responds well to treatment. Pleomorphic liposarcoma. This  is usually a high-grade cancer that is less likely to respond well to treatment. Bone and cartilage tumors are a mix of bone cells and cartilage cells. Bone and cartilage tumors include the following types: Extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. This type of bone and cartilage tumor often affects young adults and occurs in the head and neck. It is usually high grade (likely to grow quickly) and may spread to other parts of the body. It may also come back many years after treatment. Extraskeletal osteosarcoma. This type of bone and cartilage tumor is very rare in children and adolescents. It is likely to come back after treatment and may spread to the lungs. Fibrous (connective) tissue tumors include the following types: Desmoid-type fibromatosis (also called desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis). This fibrous tissue tumor is low grade (likely to grow slowly). It may come back in nearby tissues but usually does not spread to distant parts of the body. Sometimes desmoid-type fibromatosis can stop growing for a long time. Rarely, the tumor may disappear without treatment.Desmoid tumors sometimes occur in children with changes in the APC gene.    Changes in this gene may also cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FAP is    an inherited condition (passed on from parents to offspring) in which many polyps (growths on mucous membranes) form on the inside walls of the colon and rectum.     Genetic counseling (a discussion with a trained professional about inherited diseases and options for gene testing) may be needed. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. This is a tumor of the deep layers of the skin that most often forms in the trunk, arms, or legs. The cells of this tumor have a certain genetic change called a translocation (part of the COL1A1 gene switches places with part of the PDGFRB gene). To diagnose dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans usually does not spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body. Inflammatory  myofibroblastic tumor. This cancer is made up of muscle cells, connective tissue cells, and certain immune cells. It occurs in children and adolescents. It most often forms in the soft tissue, lungs, spleen, and breast. It frequently comes back after treatment but rarely spreads to distant parts of the body. A certain genetic change has been  found in about half of these tumors. Fibrosarcoma.There are two types of fibrosarcoma in children and adolescents:Infantile fibrosarcoma (also called congenital fibrosarcoma). This type of fibrosarcoma usually occurs in children   aged 1 year and younger and may be seen in a prenatal ultrasound exam.  This tumor is fast growing and is often large at diagnosis. It rarely spreads to distant parts of the body. The cells of this tumor usually have a  certain genetic change called a translocation (part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome). To diagnose infantile fibrosarcoma, the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change. A similar tumor has been seen in older children, but it does not have the translocation that is often seen in younger children.Adult fibrosarcoma.  This is the same type of fibrosarcoma found in adults.  The cells of this tumor do not have   the genetic change found in infantile fibrosarcoma. (See the PDQ summary on Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment for more information.) Myxofibrosarcoma. This is  a rare fibrous tissue  tumor that occurs less often in children than in adults. Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. This is a slow-growing tumor that forms deep in the arms or legs and mostly affects young and middle-aged adults.  The tumor may come back many years after treatment and spread to the lungs and the lining of  the chest wall. Lifelong follow-up is needed. Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. This is a rare fibrous tissue tumor that grows quickly. It can come back  and spread to other parts of the body years after treatment. Long-term follow-up is needed. Desmoid tumors sometimes occur in children with changes in the APC gene.    Changes in this gene may also cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FAP is    an inherited condition (passed on from parents to offspring) in which many polyps (growths on mucous membranes) form on the inside walls of the colon and rectum.     Genetic counseling (a discussion with a trained professional about inherited diseases and options for gene testing) may be needed. There are two types of fibrosarcoma in children and adolescents: Infantile fibrosarcoma (also called congenital fibrosarcoma). This type of fibrosarcoma usually occurs in children   aged 1 year and younger and may be seen in a prenatal ultrasound exam.  This tumor is fast growing and is often large at diagnosis. It rarely spreads to distant parts of the body. The cells of this tumor usually have a  certain genetic change called a translocation (part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome). To diagnose infantile fibrosarcoma, the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change. A similar tumor has been seen in older children, but it does not have the translocation that is often seen in younger children. Adult fibrosarcoma.  This is the same type of fibrosarcoma found in adults.  The cells of this tumor do not have   the genetic change found in infantile fibrosarcoma. (See the PDQ summary on Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment for more information.) Skeletal muscle is attached to bones and helps the body move. Rhabdomyosarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common childhood soft tissue sarcoma in children 14 years and younger. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma Treatment for more
information.) Smooth muscle lines the inside of blood vessels and hollow internal organs such as the stomach, intestines, bladder, and uterus. Leiomyosarcoma. This smooth muscle tumor has been linked with Epstein-Barr virus in children who also have HIV or AIDS.  Leiomyosarcoma may also form as a second cancer in survivors of inherited retinoblastoma, sometimes many years after the initial treatment for retinoblastoma. Plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor.  This is a rare tumor that usually affects children and young adults. The tumor usually starts as a painless growth on or just under the skin on the arm, hand, or wrist. It may rarely spread to nearby lymph nodes or to the lungs. The nerve sheath is made up of protective layers of myelin that cover nerve cells that are not part of the brain or spinal cord. Nerve sheath tumors include the following types: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.  Some children who have a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor have a rare genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). This tumor may be low grade or high grade. Malignant triton tumor. These are very fast-growing tumors that occur most often in children with NF1. Ectomesenchymoma. This is a fast-growing tumor that occurs mainly in children. Ectomesenchymomas may form in the eye socket, abdomen, arms, or legs. Pericytic tumors form in cells that wrap around blood vessels. Pericytic tumors include the following types: Myopericytoma. Infantile hemangiopericytoma is a type of myopericytoma. Children younger than 1 year at the time of diagnosis may have a better prognosis. In patients older than 1 year, infantile hemangiopericytoma is more likely to spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes and lungs. Infantile myofibromatosis. Infantile myofibromatosis is another type of myopericytoma. It is a fibrous tumor that often forms in the first 2 years of life. There may be one nodule under the skin, usually in the head and neck area (myofibroma), or several nodules in skin, muscle, or bone (myofibromatosis). In patients with infantile myofibromatosis, cancer may also spread to organs. These tumors may  go away without treatment. Tumors of unknown cell origin (the type of cell the tumor first formed in is not known) include the following types: Synovial sarcoma. Synovial sarcoma is a common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents. It usually forms in the tissues around the joints in the arms or legs, but may also form in the trunk, head, or neck. The cells of this tumor usually have a  certain genetic change called a translocation (part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome). Larger tumors have a greater risk of spreading to other parts of the body, including the lungs. Children younger than 10 years whose tumor is 5 centimeters or smaller  and has formed in the arms or legs have a better prognosis. Epithelioid sarcoma. This is a rare sarcoma that usually starts deep in soft tissue as a slow growing, firm lump and may spread to the  lymph nodes. If cancer formed in the arms, legs, or buttocks, a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done to check for cancer in the lymph nodes. Alveolar soft part sarcoma. This is a  rare tumor of the soft supporting tissue that connects and surrounds the organs and other tissues.  It most commonly forms in the arms and legs but can occur in the tissues of the mouth, jaws, and face. It may grow slowly and often spreads to other parts of the body.     Alveolar soft part sarcoma may have a better prognosis when the tumor is 5 centimeters or smaller or when the tumor is completely removed by surgery. The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation (part of  the ASSPL gene switches places with part of the TFE3 gene). To diagnose alveolar soft part sarcoma, the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change. Clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue. This is a slow-growing soft tissue tumor that begins in a tendon (tough, fibrous, cord-like tissue that connects muscle to bone or to another part of the body).  Clear cell sarcoma most commonly occurs in deep tissue of the foot, heel, and ankle. It may spread to nearby lymph nodes. The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation (part of the EWSR1 gene switches places with part of the ATF1 or CREB1 gene). To diagnose clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue, the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change. Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma. This type of soft tissue sarcoma may occur in children and adolescents. Over time, it tends to spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes and lungs. The tumor may come back many years after treatment. Extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma. See the PDQ summary on Ewing Sarcoma Treatment for information. Desmoplastic small round cell tumor. This tumor most often forms  in the peritoneum in the abdomen,  pelvis, and/or the peritoneum into the scrotum, but it may form in the kidney or other solid organs. Dozens of small tumors may occur in the peritoneum. Desmoplastic small round cell tumor may also spread to the lungs and other parts of the body. The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation (part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome). To diagnose desmoplastic small round cell tumor, the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change. Extra-renal (extracranial) rhabdoid tumor. This fast-growing tumor forms in soft tissues such as the liver and bladder.  It usually occurs in young children, including newborns, but it can occur in older children and adults.  Rhabdoid tumors may be linked to a change in a tumor suppressor gene called SMARCB1. This type of gene makes a protein that helps control cell growth. Changes in the SMARCB1 gene may be inherited. Genetic counseling (a discussion with a trained professional about inherited diseases and a  possible need for gene testing) may be needed. Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas). Benign PEComas may occur  in children with an inherited condition called tuberous sclerosis. They occur in the stomach, intestines, lungs, and genitourinary organs. PEComas grow slowly and most are not likely to spread. Undifferentiated/unclassified sarcoma. These tumors usually occur in the bones or the muscles that are attached to bones and that help the body move. Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma/malignant fibrous histiocytoma (high-grade).  This type of soft tissue tumor may form in parts of the body where patients have received radiation therapy in the past, or as a second cancer in children with retinoblastoma. The tumor usually forms in the arms or legs  and may spread to other  parts of the body. (See the PDQ summary on Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone Treatment for information about malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone.) Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma/malignant fibrous histiocytoma (high-grade).  This type of soft tissue tumor may form in parts of the body where patients have received radiation therapy in the past, or as a second cancer in children with retinoblastoma. The tumor usually forms in the arms or legs  and may spread to other  parts of the body. (See the PDQ summary on Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone Treatment for information about malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone.) Blood vessel tumors include the following types: Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas can occur in children, but are most common in adults between 30 and 50 years. They usually occur in the liver, lung, or in the bone. They may be fast growing or slow growing. In about a third of cases, the tumor spreads to other parts of the body very quickly. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Vascular Tumors Treatment  for more information.) Angiosarcoma of the soft tissue. Angiosarcoma of the soft tissue is a fast-growing tumor that forms in blood vessels or lymph vessels in any part of the body. 
Most angiosarcomas are in or near the skin. Those in deeper soft tissue can form in the liver, spleen, or lung. These tumors are very rare in children. Children sometimes have more than one tumor in the skin and/or liver.
Rarely, infantile hemangioma may become angiosarcoma of the soft tissue. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Vascular Tumors Treatment  for more information.) See the following PDQ summaries for information about types of soft tissue sarcoma not included in this summary: Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma Treatment Ewing Sarcoma Treatment Osteosarcoma Treatment Childhood Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Treatment The prognosis and treatment options  depend on the following: The part of the body where the tumor first formed. The size and grade of the tumor. The type of soft tissue sarcoma. How deep the tumor is under the skin. Whether the tumor has spread to other places in the body and where it has spread. The amount of tumor remaining after surgery to remove it. Whether radiation therapy was used to treat the tumor. Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back). After childhood soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. Sometimes childhood soft tissue sarcoma continues to grow or comes back after treatment. The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the soft tissue or to other
parts of the body is called staging. There is no standard staging system for childhood soft tissue sarcoma. To plan treatment, it is important to know
the type of soft tissue sarcoma, whether the tumor can be removed by surgery, and whether cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The following procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread: Sentinel lymph node biopsy: The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node in a group of lymph nodes to receive lymphatic drainage from the primary tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor.  A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor.  The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes.  The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed.   A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.  If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes. This procedure is used for epithelioid and clear cell sarcoma. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. PET scan: A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. This procedure is also called positron emission tomography (PET) scan. PET-CT scan: A procedure that combines the pictures from a PET scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  soft tissue sarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are soft tissue sarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, not lung cancer. Progressive childhood soft tissue sarcoma is cancer that continues to grow, spread, or get worse. Progressive disease may be a sign that the cancer has become refractory to treatment. Recurrent  childhood soft tissue sarcoma  is cancer that has recurred (come back) after treatment. The cancer may come back in the same place or in other parts of the body. There are different types of treatment for  patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma. Children with childhood soft tissue sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children. Seven  types of standard treatment are used:SurgeryRadiation therapyChemotherapyObservationTargeted therapyImmunotherapyOther Drug Therapy New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.Gene therapy Treatment for childhood soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Follow-up tests may be needed. Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Observation Targeted therapy Immunotherapy Other Drug Therapy Gene therapy Different types of treatments are available for  patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.  A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment. Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with soft tissue sarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include a pediatric surgeon with special training in the removal of soft tissue sarcomas.  The following specialists may also be included: Pediatrician. Radiation oncologist. Pediatric hematologist. Pediatric nurse specialist. Rehabilitation specialist. Psychologist. Social worker. Child-life specialist. Surgery to completely remove the soft tissue sarcoma is done when possible.  If the tumor is very large, radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given first, to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery.  This is called neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy. The following types of surgery may be used: Wide local excision: Removal of the tumor  along with some normal tissue around it. Amputation: Surgery to remove all or part of the arm or leg with cancer. Lymphadenectomy: Removal of the lymph nodes with cancer. Mohs surgery: A surgical procedure used to treat cancer in the skin. Individual layers of cancer tissue are removed and checked under a microscope one at a time until all cancer tissue has been removed. This type of surgery is used to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. It is also called Mohs micrographic surgery. Hepatectomy: Surgery to remove all or part of the liver. A second surgery may be needed to: Remove any remaining cancer cells. Check the area around where the tumor was removed for cancer cells and then remove more tissue if needed. If cancer is in the liver, a hepatectomy and liver transplant may be done (the liver is removed and replaced with a healthy one from a donor). After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.  There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. This type of radiation therapy may include the following:Stereotactic body radiation therapy:  Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue. This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy is a  type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of external radiation therapy causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy:  Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue. This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy. Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy is a  type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of external radiation therapy causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue. Whether the radiation therapy is given before or after surgery to remove the cancer depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated, if any cancer cells remain after surgery, and the expected side effects of treatment. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat childhood soft tissue sarcoma. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a type of treatment used during surgery that is being studied for desmoplastic small round cell tumor. After the surgeon has removed as much tumor tissue as possible, warmed chemotherapy is sent directly into the peritoneal cavity. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of soft tissue sarcoma being treated. Most types of soft tissue sarcoma do not respond to treatment with chemotherapy. See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information. Observation is closely monitoring a patient’s condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Observation may be done when: Complete removal of the tumor is not possible. No other treatments are available. The tumor is not likely to damage any vital organs. Observation may be used to treat desmoid-type fibromatosis, infantile fibrosarcoma, PEComa, or epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Targeted therapy is a                type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Kinase inhibitors block an enzyme called kinase (a type of protein). There are different types of kinases in the body that have different actions.ALK inhibitors may stop the cancer from growing and spreading. Crizotinib may be used to treat inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, infantile fibrosarcoma, and clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue.Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) block signals needed for tumors to grow. Imatinib is used to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Pazopanib may be  used to treat desmoid-type fibromatosis, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and some types of recurrent and progressive soft tissue sarcoma. Sorafenib may be used to treat desmoid-type fibromatosis and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Sunitinib may be used to treat alveolar soft part sarcoma. Larotrectinib is used to treat infantile fibrosarcoma. Ceritinib is used to treat inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Axitinib may be used to treat some types of progressive soft tissue sarcoma, including alveolar soft part sarcoma. mTOR inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that stops the protein that helps cells divide and survive.  mTOR inhibitors are being used to treat recurrent desmoplastic small round cell tumors, PEComas, and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and are being studied to treat malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Sirolimus and temsirolimus are types of mTOR inhibitor therapy. ALK inhibitors may stop the cancer from growing and spreading. Crizotinib may be used to treat inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, infantile fibrosarcoma, and clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) block signals needed for tumors to grow. Imatinib is used to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Pazopanib may be  used to treat desmoid-type fibromatosis, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and some types of recurrent and progressive soft tissue sarcoma. Sorafenib may be used to treat desmoid-type fibromatosis and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Sunitinib may be used to treat alveolar soft part sarcoma. Larotrectinib is used to treat infantile fibrosarcoma. Ceritinib is used to treat inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Axitinib may be used to treat some types of progressive soft tissue sarcoma, including alveolar soft part sarcoma. New types of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being studied such as: Entrectinib and selitrectinib for infantile fibrosarcoma. Trametinib for epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Other types of targeted therapy are being studied in clinical trials, including the following: Angiogenesis inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that prevent the growth of new blood vessels needed for tumors to grow. Angiogenesis inhibitors, such as cediranib, sunitinib, and thalidomide are being studied to treat alveolar soft part sarcoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Bevacizumab is being used to treat angiosarcoma. Histone methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that work inside cancer cells and block signals needed for tumors to grow. HMT inhibitors, such as tazemetostat, are being studied for the treatment of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, epithelioid sarcoma, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, and extrarenal (extracranial) rhabdoid tumor. Heat-shock protein inhibitors block certain proteins that protect tumor cells and help them grow.  Ganetespib is a heat shock protein inhibitor being studied in combination with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors that cannot be removed by surgery. NOTCH pathway inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that works inside the cancer cells and blocks signals needed for tumors to grow. NOTCH pathway inhibitors are being studied for the treatment of desmoid-type fibromatosis. Gamma-secretase inhibitors, such as nirogacestat, are a type of NOTCH pathway inhibitors. See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information. Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patient’s immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of biologic therapy. Interferon and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy are types of immunotherapy. Interferon  interferes with the division of tumor cells and can slow tumor growth. It is used to treat epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: Some types of immune cells, such as T cells, and some cancer cells have certain proteins, called checkpoint proteins, on their surface that keep immune responses in check. When cancer cells have large amounts of these proteins, they will not be attacked and killed by T cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors block these proteins and the ability of T cells to kill cancer cells is increased.There are two types of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy:CTLA-4 inhibitor therapy: CTLA-4 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body’s immune responses in check. When CTLA-4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. CTLA-4 inhibitors attach to CTLA-4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells. Ipilimumab is a type of CTLA-4 inhibitor that is being studied to treat angiosarcoma.EnlargeImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as B7-1/B7-2 on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and CTLA-4 on T cells, help keep the body’s immune responses in check. When the T-cell receptor (TCR) binds to antigen and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the APC and CD28 binds to B7-1/B7-2 on the APC, the T cell can be activated. However, the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 keeps the T cells in the inactive state so they are not able to kill tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) allows the T cells to be active and to kill tumor cells (right panel).PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor therapy: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body’s immune responses in check. PD-L1 is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other.  This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells. Pembrolizumab is a type of PD-1 inhibitor that is used to treat progressive and recurrent soft tissue sarcoma. Nivolumab is a type of PD-1 inhibitor that is being studied to treat angiosarcoma. Atezolizumab is a type of PD-L1 inhibitor that is being studied to treat alveolar soft part sarcoma.EnlargeImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).Immunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer.

This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer. Steroid therapy has antitumor effects in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working. Antiestrogens (drugs that block estrogen), such as tamoxifen, may be used to treat desmoid-type fibromatosis. Prasterone is being studied for the treatment of synovial sarcoma. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are drugs (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen) that are commonly used to decrease fever, swelling, pain, and redness. In the treatment of desmoid-type fibromatosis, an NSAID called sulindac  may be used to help block the growth of cancer cells. This summary section describes treatments that are being 
         studied in 
    clinical trials.  
         It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Gene therapy is being studied for childhood synovial sarcoma that has recurred, spread, or cannot be removed by surgery. Some of the patient's T cells (a type of white blood cell) are removed and the genes in the cells are changed in a laboratory (genetically engineered) so that they will attack specific cancer cells. They are then given back to the patient by infusion. To learn more about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, visit Side Effects. Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects.  Late effects of cancer treatment may include: Physical problems. Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory. Second cancers (new types of cancer). Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information.) For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or checkups. Some tests that were done to diagnose or stage the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish. PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood soft tissue sarcoma.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board. A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

the first definitions included certain opportunistic infections, Kaposi
sarcoma, and central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas.    
In 1984, a multicenter
study described the clinical spectrum of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) in the
populations at risk of AIDS.[1]  The incidence of NHL has increased in a course almost parallel
 to that of the AIDS epidemic and accounts for 2% to 3% of newly diagnosed AIDS
cases.[2] Since the introduction of  highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the mid-1990s, the incidence of lymphomas has decreased, and outcomes have improved.[3] Higher CD4-positive T-lymphocyte (CD4) counts in the HAART era have been associated with a shift in histological diagnoses. The shift is away from primary effusion lymphoma and primary CNS lymphoma, which occur with the lowest CD4 counts, and toward histologies that occur at higher CD4 counts, such as Burkitt lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).[4-6] In contrast to less-frequent incidences of all the lymphoproliferative disorders in the HAART era, the incidence rate of anal cancer has not changed.[7] Pathologically, AIDS-related lymphomas comprise a narrow spectrum of
histologic types consisting almost exclusively of B-cell tumors of aggressive
type.  These include the following: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (including B-cell immunoblastic lymphoma). Small
noncleaved lymphoma, either Burkitt or Burkitt-like. The HIV-associated lymphomas
can be categorized into the following: Aggressive B-cell lymphoma (see above). Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL). Primary effusion lymphoma. Plasmablastic multicentric Castleman disease. HL. Multiple reviews  of HL occurring in patients
at risk of AIDS have been done;[8,9]  however, HL is still
not part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition of AIDS because  no clear
demonstration of its increased incidence in conjunction with HIV has been shown, as is the
case for aggressive NHL.  The CDC, in conjunction with the
San Francisco Department of Public Health, has reported a cohort study in which
HIV-infected men had an excess risk that was attributable to the HIV infection
in 19.3 cases of HL per 100,000 person-years and 224.9 cases of
NHL per 100,000 person-years.  Although this report found an excess incidence
of HL in HIV-infected homosexual men, additional epidemiologic studies will be needed before the CDC will reconsider
HL as an HIV-associated malignancy.[10] HIV-associated HL presents in an aggressive fashion, often with
extranodal or bone marrow involvement.[8,9,11]  A distinctive feature of
HIV-associated HL is the lesser frequency of mediastinal
adenopathy compared with non–HIV-associated HL.  Most patients in
these series had either mixed cellularity or lymphocyte-depleted HL, expression of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated proteins in Reed-Sternberg cells, B symptoms, and a median CD4 lymphocyte count of 300/dL or
lower.[12]  
In a retrospective multicenter review of 62 patients, those receiving HAART with chemotherapy had a 74% 2-year overall survival (OS) rate  versus a 30% OS rate for those not receiving HAART (P < .001).[13][Level of evidence C1] Among 201 patients with classical HL and HIV positivity, the 2- to 5-year OS rate of 88% to 90% after treatment with ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine), or similar regimens, and HAART, was not significantly different from the OS rate of HIV-negative patients with newly diagnosed HL in two uncontrolled comparisons.[14,15][Level of evidence C3] These studies confirm that patients with HL who were treated with standard regimens and HAART have outcomes that are similar to those of the uninfected population.[16] Furthermore,  immune function recovers over the course of 6 to 9 months after completion of chemotherapy.[15] Primary effusion lymphoma has been associated with Kaposi
sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)/human herpes virus type 8 (HHV8).[17,18] 
Primary effusion lymphoma presents as a liquid phase spreading along serous membranes in the absence of masses or adenopathy.[17] In addition to HHV8, many cases are also associated with EBV.  Extension of lymphoma from the effusion to underlying tissue may occur. A series of 20 patients, including 19 treated with modified infusional etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide and prednisone (modEPOCH), had a 3-year cancer-specific survival rate of 47% and a median OS of 22 months.[19][Level of evidence C3] The plasmablastic type of multicentric Castleman disease is also associated with a coinfection of KSHV/HHV8 and HIV.[20] Patients typically present with fever, night sweats, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly.  Patients may progress to primary effusion lymphoma or to plasmablastic or anaplastic large cell lymphoma.  Anecdotal responses to the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab alone (along with HAART), have been reported.[21-24][Level of evidence C3] For a prospective cohort of 84 patients treated with rituximab for HIV and HHV8 multicentric Castleman disease, the 5-year rate of relapse-free survival  was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72%–92%), and all patients responded again to rituximab at relapse.[24][Level of evidence C2] An international database of 48,000 HIV-seropositive individuals from the
United States, Europe, and Australia found a 42% decline in the incidence of 
NHLs from 1997 to 1999 compared with the same incidences in 1992 to 1996, both for
PCNSL and for systemic lymphoma.[25]  The introduction of HAART is the proposed explanation for this decline.[26]  The diagnosis of AIDS precedes the onset of
NHL in approximately 50% of the patients; however,   in the other half of the patients, the
diagnosis of AIDS is made at the time of the diagnosis of NHL and HIV positivity.[3]  The geographic distribution of these lymphomas
is also similar to the geographic spread of AIDS.  Unlike KS,
which has a predilection for homosexual men and appears to be on the decline in
incidence, all risk groups appear to have an excess number of NHLs; these risk groups include intravenous drug users and children of
HIV-positive individuals. In general, the clinical setting and response to treatment of patients with
AIDS-related lymphoma is very different from that of the non-HIV patients with
lymphoma.  The HIV-infected individual with aggressive lymphoma usually
presents with advanced-stage disease that is frequently extranodal.[27] Common extranodal sites include the following: Bone marrow. Liver. Meninges. Gastrointestinal tract. Very unusual sites are also characteristic and include the following: Anus. Heart. Bile duct. Gingiva. Muscles. The clinical course is
more aggressive, and the disease is both more extensive and less responsive to
chemotherapy.  Immunodeficiency and cytopenias, common in these patients at the
time of initial presentation, are exacerbated by the administration of
chemotherapy.  Treatment of the malignancy increases the risk of
opportunistic infections, which further compromise the delivery of
adequate treatment. Prognoses of patients with AIDS-related lymphoma have been associated with the following:[28] Stage (i.e., extent of disease, extranodal involvement, lactate dehydrogenase level, and bone marrow involvement). Age. Severity of the underlying immunodeficiency (measured by CD4 lymphocyte count
in peripheral blood). Performance status. Prior AIDS diagnosis (i.e., history of opportunistic infection or KS). Patients with AIDS-related
PCNSL appear to have more severe underlying HIV-related disease
than do patients with systemic lymphoma.  In one report, this severity was
evidenced by patients with PCNSL who had a higher incidence of 
previously diagnosed  AIDS (73% vs. 37%), lower median number of CD4 lymphocytes
(30/dL vs. 189/dL), and a worse median survival time (2.5 months vs. 6.0
months).[29]  This report also showed that patients with poor risk factors—defined as Karnofsky Performance Status score lower than 70%, history of previously diagnosed  AIDS, and bone marrow involvement—had a median survival time of 4.0
months compared with patients in a good prognosis group who had none of these risk factors,
and who had a median survival time of 11.3 months. In another report (NIAID-ACTG-142), prognostic
factors were evaluated in a group of 192 patients with newly diagnosed
AIDS-related lymphoma who were randomly assigned to receive either low-dose
methotrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
dexamethasone (m-BACOD) or standard-dose m-BACOD with granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor.[30]  No differences existed between these two 
treatments in terms of efficacy for disease-free survival, median survival, or
risk ratio for death.[30][Level of evidence A1]  On multivariate analysis,
factors associated with decreased survival included age older than 35 years,
history of intravenous drug use, stage III or stage IV disease, and CD4 counts lower than 100 cells/mm3.  The
International Prognostic Index may also be predictive for survival.[31-33]
In a multicenter cohort study of 203 patients, in a multivariable Cox model, response to HAART was independently associated with prolonged survival (relative hazard, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16–0.62).[34][Level of evidence C2] Ziegler JL, Beckstead JA, Volberding PA, et al.: Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 90 homosexual men.

histologic types consisting almost exclusively of B-cell tumors of aggressive
type.  These include the following: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (B-cell immunoblastic lymphoma). Small
noncleaved lymphoma, either Burkitt or Burkitt-like. AIDS-related lymphomas, though usually of B-cell origin as demonstrated by
immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement studies, have also been shown to
be oligoclonal, polyclonal, and  monoclonal in origin.  Although HIV
does not appear to have a direct etiologic role, HIV infection does lead to an
altered immunologic milieu.  HIV generally infects T lymphocytes with the  loss of
regulation function that leads to hypergammaglobulinemia and polyclonal B-cell
hyperplasia.  B cells are not the targets of HIV infection.  Instead,
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is thought to be at least a cofactor in the etiology
of some of these lymphomas.  The EBV genome has been detected in most patients with AIDS-related lymphomas; molecular analysis suggests
that the cells were infected before clonal proliferation began.[1]  The rare  primary effusion lymphoma consistently
harbors human herpes virus type 8 and frequently contains EBV.[2]  HIV-related T-cell
lymphomas have also been identified and appear to be associated with EBV
infection.[3] Thorley-Lawson DA, Gross A: Persistence of the Epstein-Barr virus and the origins of associated lymphomas.

non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who do not have AIDS, most patients with AIDS-related lymphomas have far-advanced
disease. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has adopted the Lugano classification to evaluate and stage lymphoma.[1] The Lugano classification system replaces the Ann Arbor classification system, which was adopted in 1971 at the Ann Arbor Conference,[2] with some modifications 18 years later from the Cotswolds meeting.[3,4] Occasionally, specialized staging systems are used.  The physician should be
aware of the system used in a specific report. The E designation  is used when extranodal lymphoid malignancies arise in
tissues separate from, but near, the major lymphatic aggregates.  Stage IV
refers to disease that is diffusely spread throughout an extranodal site, such
as the liver.  If pathologic proof of involvement of one  or more extralymphatic
sites has been documented, the symbol for the site of involvement, followed by
a plus sign (+), is listed. Current practice assigns a clinical stage (CS) based on the findings of the
clinical evaluation and a pathologic stage (PS) based on the findings made as a
result of invasive procedures beyond the initial biopsy. For example, on percutaneous biopsy, a patient with inguinal adenopathy and a
positive lymphangiogram without systemic symptoms might be found to have
involvement of the liver and bone marrow.  The precise stage of such a patient
would be CS IIA, PS IVA(H+)(M+). A number of other factors that are not included in the above staging system are
important for the staging and prognosis of patients with NHL.   These factors
include the following: Age. Performance status (PS). Tumor size. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values. The number of extranodal sites. Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

appropriate for the stage and histologic subset of malignant lymphoma with the
limitations imposed by HIV infection.[1]  In
addition to antitumor therapy, essential components of an optimal non-Hodgkin
lymphoma treatment strategy include the following:[2,3] Highly active antiretroviral therapy. Prophylaxis for
opportunistic infections. Rapid recognition and treatment of intercurrent
infections. Patients with HIV positivity and underlying immunodeficiency
have poor bone marrow reserve, which compromises the potential for drug dose
intensity.  Intercurrent opportunistic infection is a risk that may
also lead to a decrease in drug delivery.  Furthermore, chemotherapy itself
compromises the immune system and increases the likelihood of opportunistic
infection. Levine AM: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related lymphoma: clinical aspects.

Blood 134 (17): 1385-1394, 2019. [PUBMED Abstract] Current Clinical Trials The treatment of AIDS-related lymphomas involves overcoming several problems.  These are all
aggressive lymphomas, which by definition are diffuse large cell/immunoblastic
lymphoma or small noncleaved cell lymphoma (Burkitt lymphoma).  These lymphomas frequently involve
the bone marrow and central nervous system (CNS) and, therefore, are usually in an
advanced stage.  In addition, the immunodeficiency of AIDS and the leukopenia
that is commonly seen with HIV infection makes the use of immunosuppressive
chemotherapy challenging. The introduction of highly active  antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a marked reduction in opportunistic infections, prolonged survival with HIV infection, and a median overall survival (OS) for patients with AIDS-related lymphoma that is  comparable with the outcome in  the nonimmunosuppressed population.[1-7][Level of evidence C3] The use of HAART has also allowed standard-dose and even intensive chemotherapy regimens to be given with reasonable safety to patients with AIDS-related lymphomas, which is comparable with the outcome in non-HIV patients.[1-10] Several prospective nonrandomized trials and pooled individual data from 19 prospective trials that included  1,546 patients show that the addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy improves the complete response rate, progression-free survival, and OS.[3-6][Level of evidence C3] Several other prospective nonrandomized trials and the pooled individual data from the same 1,546 patients also show that infusional EPOCH (infusional etoposide, infusional vincristine, infusional doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and  prednisone) produced better outcomes than did CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) (OS, hazard ratio, 0.33;  P = .03).[3,6,7][Level of evidence C3]  Concurrent use of HAART with the infusional EPOCH regimen is controversial; one group advocated for HAART after completion of chemotherapy,[7] while others allowed concurrent therapy.[6] For patients with Burkitt lymphoma, dose-modified regimens such as R-CODOX (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, methotrexate, cytarabine and rituximab)-M/IVAC (ifosfamide, etoposide, and high-dose cytarabine) or R-EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, and doxorubicin in combination with rituximab) have shown good results with concurrent or sequential HAART.[7,11,12] Patients at risk of subsequent CNS involvement
include those with bone marrow involvement or those with EBV
identified in the primary tumor or in the cerebrospinal fluid (i.e., by polymerase
chain reaction).[13,14]  Intrathecal chemotherapy is usually considered for 
patients who are at higher risk of CNS involvement. Highly selected patients with resistant or relapsed lymphoma after first-line chemotherapy and with continued responsiveness to HAART underwent second-line chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy and autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation.  Long-term survivors have been reported anecdotally for these highly selected patients who relapsed.[15-18][Level of evidence C3] Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

AIDS-related lymphomas, primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma   (PCNSL) is an aggressive B-cell neoplasm, either
diffuse large B-cell or diffuse immunoblastic non-Hodgkin lymphoma (a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma).  AIDS-related PCNSL has
been reported to have a 100% association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).[1]  These patients usually
have evidence of low CD4-positive T lymphocyte counts, high HIV viral load, severe debilitation, and
focal neurologic symptoms such as seizures, changes in mental status, and
paralysis. Computed tomographic scans show contrast-enhancing mass lesions that may not
always be distinguished from other CNS diseases, such as toxoplasmosis, that
occur in patients with AIDS.[2]  Magnetic resonance imaging studies using gadolinium
contrast may be a more useful initial diagnostic tool in differentiating
lymphoma from cerebral toxoplasmosis or progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy.  Lymphoma tends to present with large lesions, which are
enhanced by gadolinium.  In cerebral toxoplasmosis, ring enhancement is very
common, lesions tend to be smaller, and multiple lesions are seen.[3-5]  Use of
positron emission scanning has demonstrated an improved ability to distinguish
PCNSL from toxoplasmosis.[6,7]  PCNSL
has an increased uptake while toxoplasmosis lesions are metabolically inactive. 
Antibodies against toxoplasmosis may also be very useful because most cerebral toxoplasmosis occurs as a consequence of reactivity of a
previous infection.  If the immunoglobulin G titer is less than 1:4, the disease is unlikely
to be toxoplasmotic.  A lumbar puncture may be useful to detect  as many as 23%
of patients with malignant cells in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 
Evaluating the CSF for EBV DNA may be a useful lymphoma-specific tool because EBV
is present in all patients with PCNSL.  Despite  the many evaluations,
however, most patients with PCNSL require a pathological
diagnosis.[8-10]  Diagnosis is made by biopsy.  Sometimes, a biopsy is
attempted only after failure of antibiotics for toxoplasmosis, which will
produce clinical and radiographic improvement within 1 to 3 weeks in patients
with cerebral toxoplasmosis.[11] Radiation therapy alone has usually been used in this group of patients.  With
doses in the range of 35 Gy to 40 Gy, median duration of survival has been only
72 to 119 days.[2,12,13]  Survival is longer in younger patients with better
performance status and the absence of opportunistic infection.[14]  In the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, a median survival of 18 months has been seen with radiation therapy alone.[15] An anecdotal report using HAART and high-dose methotrexate for patients with AIDS-related PCNSL showed a median survival that had not been reached with a median follow-up of 27 months.[16] Most patients
respond to treatment by showing partial improvement in neurologic symptoms. 
Autopsies have revealed that these patients die of opportunistic infections as
well as tumor progression.  Treatment of these patients is also complicated by
other AIDS-related CNS infections, including subacute AIDS encephalitis,
cytomegalovirus encephalitis, and toxoplasmosis encephalitis.  Spontaneous
remissions have been reported after HAART.[17] Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  2014  TCGA study improves understanding of genetic drivers of thyroid cancer   News Releases   Posted:
October 23, 2014  240-760-6600 A comprehensive analysis of the genomes of nearly 500 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) – the most common form of thyroid cancer – has provided new insights into the roles of frequently mutated cancer genes and other genomic alterations that drive disease development. The findings also may help improve diagnosis and treatment. Investigators with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network identified new molecular subtypes that will help clinicians determine which tumors are more aggressive and which are more likely to respond to certain treatments. Their findings confirmed that PTCs are driven primarily by mutations in one of two cancer-associated genes: BRAF (specifically a mutation known as V600E) or RAS. The work also detailed many differences between the two genetic types, particularly in signaling pathways that promote tumor development and growth. The researchers developed a scoring system to reflect gene expression in the two PTC types, allowing  them to characterize tumors and determine both the pathway a tumor uses to send signals and its relative aggressiveness. Where a tumor lies on a scale – called its thyroid differentiation score – can have important treatment implications because different tumor signaling properties can mean the cancer responds differently to particular therapies. The study also showed that BRAF-driven tumors have a broader range of genetic complexity than previously thought, with distinct subtypes. The results suggest a need for a new classification system that more accurately reflects underlying genetic characteristics of the cancer. The researchers, led by Thomas Giordano, M.D., Ph.D., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Gad Getz, Ph.D., Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, reported their results online October 23, 2014, in Cell. Thyroid cancer is the fastest growing cancer in the United States, with more than 20,000 new PTC cases each year. Most thyroid cancers are slow-growing and treatable with surgery, hormone therapy and radioactive iodine. TCGA is a collaboration jointly supported and managed by the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute, both parts of the National Institutes of Health.

Stories of Discovery


Milestones in Cancer Research and Discovery   Annual Report to the Nation  Research Advances by Cancer Type  Stories of Discovery  Milestones in Cancer Research and Discovery  More information about the Annual Report to the Nation, including key findings and associated charts, graphs, and social media tools, is available on the SEER site. Part 1 of the latest Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer was released on October 27, 2022. In addition to providing rates of new cases and deaths for the most common cancers in the United States, this year’s report also examines trends in pancreatic cancer and its subtypes in detail. Among the findings of the report: Overall cancer death rates continued to fall among men, women, children, and adolescents and young adults in every major racial and ethnic group in the United States from 2015 to 2019.  Overall cancer incidence rates remained stable for men and children but increased for women and adolescents and young adults from 2014 to 2018.  From 2001 to 2018, incidence rates of pancreatic cancer increased by 1% per year among both men and women.  From 2001 to 2019, death rates from pancreatic cancer increased by 0.2% per year for both sexes.  From 2001 to 2018, incidence rates of two common subtypes of pancreatic cancer, neuroendocrine tumors and adenocarcinomas, increased in both men and women, while unspecified subtypes and other pancreatic tumors decreased.  Part 2 of the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer was released September 27, 2023. This report examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on new cases and deaths from certain cancers. Among the findings of the report: New diagnoses of six major cancer types in the United States fell abruptly in early 2020, but by July 2020, diagnoses of all cancer types except prostate cancer had returned to pre-pandemic levels.  Electronic pathology reports also declined steeply in early 2020 before returning to pre-pandemic levels.  New cases of early-stage cancers fell more sharply than new cases of advanced cancers.  Asian or Pacific Islander populations had greater declines in new cases of all cancer types except for pancreatic cancer, compared with white, Black, and American Indian or Alaska Native populations.   Annual Report to the Nation: Cancer deaths continue downward trend; modest improvements in survival for pancreatic cancer  Annual Report to the Nation Part 2: New cancer diagnoses fell abruptly early in the COVID-19 pandemic  Cancer Statistics  Archive of Annual Reports to the Nation   Updated:

Events & Webinars   About CCDI  CCDI Progress  Community Stories  Data Ecosystem  Events & Webinars  Smita believes data sharing is crucial for addressing childhood cancer disparities and improving outcomes. Distinguished Professor in Pediatrics  Director, Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship  And Gay and Bew White Endowed Chair in Pediatric Oncology, University of Alabama, Birmingham  Identifying and understanding what challenges patients face during care is a driving motivation for Dr. Smita Bhatia’s (she/her) work in childhood cancer. One issue is how often children take their anticancer medication, with lower rates appearing in underrepresented minority groups. In one clinical trial, Smita’s team developed an approach where a child’s doctor texts a reminder about taking a medication to the child and their parent. After the child takes the medication, both child and parent text back confirming the dose taken. The hope is that direct reminders make it easier to adhere to treatment and improve rates at which children across all populations take their medication. Looking ahead, Smita hopes that “increased sharing and access to real-world data,” like the methods, outcomes, and lessons learned from her recent work, “will lead to quicker and more powerful discoveries that can be applied to patient care.”  Posted:

Although adenoma implies a benign process, all varieties of tracheobronchial tumors occasionally  display malignant behavior. Most primary lung tumors are malignant. In a review of 383 primary pulmonary neoplasms in children,  76% were malignant and 24% were benign.[3] The following histological types have been identified (see Figure 1):[4-10] Carcinoid tumor (neuroendocrine tumor of the bronchus). Carcinoid tumors account for 80% to 85% of all tracheobronchial tumors in children.[4-8]; [11][Level of evidence C1] It is the most common tracheobronchial tumor. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma. A slow-growing vascular polypoid mass of the airway that is the second most common (10%) pediatric tracheobronchial tumor. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. These low-grade tumors account for 1% of pediatric tracheobronchial tumors, are commonly located in the upper trachea, and rarely metastasize.  Intrabronchial (pulmonary) inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors are incredibly rare compared with other sites of disease. For more information, see Childhood Pulmonary Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumors Treatment. Rhabdomyosarcoma. Granular cell tumors. Malignant transformation has not been documented in pediatric patients. EnlargeFigure 1.  The most representative primary tracheobronchial tumors are described with their more frequent location.

Prognosis is dependent on both histology and stage.[1] The presenting symptoms of a tracheobronchial tumor are usually caused by an incomplete tracheobronchial obstruction and include the following: Cough. Recurrent pneumonitis. Hemoptysis. Because of difficulties in diagnosis, symptoms are frequently present for months. Occasionally, children with wheezing are treated for asthma, and diagnosis can be delayed for as long as 4 to 5 years.[2] Metastatic lesions are reported in approximately 6% of carcinoid tumors, and recurrences are reported in 2% of cases. Atypical carcinoid tumors are rare but more aggressive, and 50% of these patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis.[1,3] One study reported a single child with a carcinoid tumor and metastatic disease who developed the classic carcinoid syndrome.[4]  Octreotide nuclear scans may demonstrate uptake of
radioactivity by the tumor or lymph nodes, suggesting metastatic spread. Lal DR, Clark I, Shalkow J, et al.: Primary epithelial lung malignancies in the pediatric population.

Cancer 51 (3): 492-7, 1983. [PUBMED Abstract] The management of tracheobronchial tumors  is somewhat controversial because tracheobronchial tumors are usually visible endoscopically. Biopsy of these lesions may be hazardous because of the risk of hemorrhage. New endoscopic techniques have allowed biopsy to be performed more safely.[1,2] However, endoscopic resection is not recommended except in highly selected cases.[2-4] Bronchography or computed tomography may be helpful to determine the degree of bronchiectasis distal to the obstruction since the degree of pulmonary destruction may influence surgical therapy.[5] Roby BB, Drehner D, Sidman JD: Pediatric tracheal and endobronchial tumors: an institutional experience.

Treatment options for tracheobronchial tumors, according to histological type, are as follows: The treatment of choice is surgical resection with lymph node sampling.  The overall survival rate is 95% for these patients.[4,5] The recommended treatment is open surgical resection and lymph node sampling. Endoscopic resection is not recommended.[6,7] The treatment of choice is surgery.  However, if the tumor is ALK mutation positive, treatment with crizotinib may be effective.[7-10] Surgery is not indicated. This tumor is very responsive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, even with lymph node metastasis.[7] For more information, see Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma Treatment. Surgical resection is based on morbidity risk.[7,11,12] For information about other neuroendocrine carcinoid tumors, see Pediatric Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors Treatment.

For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the ClinicalTrials.gov website. Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has been slowly increasing since 1975.[1]    Referral to medical centers with multidisciplinary teams of cancer specialists experienced in treating cancers that occur in childhood and adolescence should be considered. This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following health care professionals and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
that will achieve optimal survival and quality of life: Primary care physicians. Pediatric surgeons. Radiation
oncologists. Pediatric medical oncologists/hematologists. Rehabilitation
specialists. Pediatric nurse specialists. Social workers. Child-life professionals. Psychologists. For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on Supportive and Palliative Care. The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of pediatric patients
with cancer.[2]  At
these pediatric cancer centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy.  Most of the progress made in identifying curative
therapy for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[3-5]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For specific information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[6] The U.S. Rare Diseases Act of 2002 defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare. The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[7,8] Also, the designation of a pediatric rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows: A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than 2 cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than 2 cases per 1 million people were also included  in the very rare group because there is a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[9] The Children's Oncology Group (COG) defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers, colorectal cancers, etc.).[10]  These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[4] Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years. Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years. These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the low number of patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the lack of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.

Even very young children can sense when something is wrong. They will see that you don't feel well, are away from home more often, or can't spend as much time with them as you used to. Children as young as 18 months old begin to notice what's going on around them. It's important to be honest. Telling the truth is better than letting them imagine the worst. Give your kids time to ask questions and express their feelings. Nothing your child did, thought, or said caused you to get cancer.  Just because you have cancer doesn't mean you'll die from it. In fact, many people live with cancer for a long time.  Your child can't make you well. But there are ways he or she can make you feel better.  Scientists are finding many new ways to treat cancer.  Your child is not alone. Other children have parents who have cancer.  It's okay to be upset, angry, or scared.  Your child can't do anything to change the fact that you have cancer.  Family members may act differently because they're worried about you.  You will make sure that your children are taken care of, no matter what happens to you.  They can help you by doing nice things like washing dishes, cleaning their room, or even drawing you a picture.  They should still go to school and take part in sports and other fun activities.  They can talk to other adults for support, such as teachers, family members, and religious or spiritual leaders.  Children can react to cancer in many different ways. For example, they may: Be confused, scared, lonely, or overwhelmed  Feel guilty and think that something they did or said caused your cancer  Feel angry when they are asked to be quiet or to do more chores around the house  Miss the amount of attention they're used to getting  Regress and behave as they did when they were much younger  Get into trouble at school or at home  Be clingy and afraid to leave the house  Learn what can help children and teens who have a family member with cancer. If you have a teenager, know that they're at a time in their lives when they're trying to break away and be independent from their parents. Try to get them to talk about their feelings and ask questions. Tell them as much as they want to know about your cancer. Ask them for their opinions and, if possible, let them help you make decisions. Teens may want to talk with other people in their lives. Friends can be a great source of support for them, especially those who also have a serious illness in their family. Other family members, teachers, coaches, and spiritual leaders can also help. Encourage your teenage children to talk about their fears and feelings with people they trust. For more information about support for teens, you may find it helpful to share this e-book When Your Parent Has Cancer: A Guide for Teens with them. If you have adult children, your relationship with them may change now that you have cancer. You may: Ask them to help with making health care decisions, paying bills, or taking care of the house  Ask them to explain medical information  Need them to go to the doctor with you or pick up medicines  Rely on them for emotional support  Feel awkward when they help with your physical care  For some parents, it may be hard to ask for comfort and care from their grown children. But it's important to talk about cancer with your family members, even if they get upset or worry about you. Try to include them when talking about your treatment. Let them know the choices you would like them to make about your care, in case you're too sick to make the choices yourself. (See Advance Directives.) Recognize that it may be hard for your children to have this talk and that, like you, they're trying to adjust to your illness. For more details and age-related tips on talking to kids, your family and friends may find it helpful to read the NCI booklet, When Someone You Love Is Being Treated for Cancer.  Updated:

Past Programs  Funding  Researcher Resources  News & Events  About DCB  Progress   Past Programs  Juan Fuxman Bass, a CSBC investigator at Boston University, studied biology as an undergraduate and graduate student at the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina. Now, he uses systems approaches to investigate the role of gene regulatory networks in cancer. In this interview he discusses his career journey, challenges in cancer systems biology, and his CSBC research focused on breast cancer. During my graduate studies, I felt like math and computational work were missing from my research. For my postdoc, I wanted to switch from immunology to systems biology, since I knew that the future of research was in integrating high-throughput experimentation with mathematical modeling. However, getting a postdoc interview was challenging because I had no experience in systems biology. I sent out a lot of applications, and eventually had an interview with Dr. Marian Walhout. It was an instant fit and she offered me the position over the phone. I accepted right away, and that was the best decision that I could have made. She was and she still is an excellent mentor. She helped me learn about the field of systems biology and how to develop a scientific career in the U.S. Switching fields for my postdoc was hard, because I had to learn everything from scratch. But it was also very rewarding. It gave me the opportunity to learn new experimental approaches and new ways of tackling biological questions. One challenge is identifying the right datasets and modeling approaches which will be informative of the cell state and provide accurate predictions for therapeutics. These datasets may not necessarily be the ones that are easy to obtain, and this is going to require the development of new tools. The other challenge is that we need to generate accurate models that consider the tumor microenvironment and immune cells in a patient-specific manner. There are many groups that are starting to tackle these challenges. It’s also important to remember that every challenge represents an opportunity to develop new tools and mathematical frameworks. Now, a lot of the new technologies that can address these challenges are coming from cutting-edge investigators of the CSBC and the Physical Sciences – Oncology Network. One of the ultimate goals of cancer systems biology is to generate models of tumorigenesis by identifying all the perturbing interactions between molecules in cancer cells. The central hypothesis of our grant is that perturbations emerging from cancer-specific gene isoforms (in other words, different versions or forms of a normal gene) are going to be crucial for cancer development. Most studies have focused on genome alterations, such as mutations, amplifications, deletions, and large chromosome changes in cancer cells, which are often considered to be the primary event of cancer progression. However, cancer-specific isoforms have also been shown to be important in tumorigenesis. Changes in the isoforms of transcription factors, which are the proteins that are responsible for turning on and off gene expression in different cells and conditions, have been shown to play a major role in cancer progression and metastasis. Yet the extent to which differences in transcription factor isoforms between normal and cancer tissues lead to altered gene expression in cancer remains unclear. Hundreds of transcription factor isoforms have been identified in cancer samples, but the vast majority remain uncharacterized at the functional level. This means that we don’t know which gene they will affect, and whether it will be turning gene expression on or off. In this project, we are working on an initial step towards this long-term goal by characterizing the effect of a large number of transcription factor isoforms in breast cancer. We aim to combine mathematical modeling with high-throughput experimental strategies at the level of molecular interactions to predict cancer drivers and suppressors. The lessons learned from these studies will provide a framework to design novel therapeutics. Identifying cancer-specific interactions and perturbations provides an opportunity to design therapeutics that can either wire back normal interactions that were rewired in cancer or perturb the system in a way that will bring it into a state like a normal cell. Without having a map of what interacts with what, it’s very hard to develop a mathematical model to predict responses. This predictive modeling enables the design of therapeutic interventions that target cancer-specific interactions Boston University Profile of Juan Fuxman Bass  Juan Fuxman Bass Lab Website  If you would like to reproduce some or all of this content, see Reuse of NCI Information for guidance about copyright and permissions.

Research Articles   Research Articles  Combining two drugs that target the HER2 protein, trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and pertuzumab (Perjeta™), with chemotherapy is a new treatment option for women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, according to final results from a large phase III clinical trial that were presented September 28, 2014. The initial results of the trial, dubbed CLEOPATRA, were presented on December 7, 2011, at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) and published the same day in the New England Journal of Medicine. Those results showed that combining both HER2-targeting agents with the chemotherapy drug docetaxel as initial treatment led to a 6-month improvement in progression-free survival compared with treatment with trastuzumab and docetaxel. Although both drugs target the HER2 protein on the surface of cancer cells, they do so in different ways. Laboratory studies have indicated that the drugs may have a synergistic effect on HER2-positive tumors, which, the trial investigators explained, are “addicted” to HER2 signaling. More than 800 women were enrolled in the randomized trial; half received all three drugs, and half received trastuzumab and docetaxel, a standard first-line treatment for women with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, plus a placebo. Median progression-free survival was 18.5 months in the three-drug arm and 12.4 months in the two-drug-plus-placebo arm. More women who received the three-drug combination experienced substantial shrinkage of their tumors than women who received the standard treatment. Trastuzumab has been associated with significant cardiac side effects in some women, but no increase in such side effects was seen in women in the trial who received both HER2-targeted drugs. The initial analysis showed a trend toward better overall survival in women treated with both HER2-targeting agents than in women treated with trastuzumab, but the study had not gone on long enough for the survival data to be definitive. The study investigators presented the final results of the trial at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2014 Congress in Madrid. After a median follow-up of 50 months, the women treated with both HER2-targeted agents lived 15.7 months longer than those treated with trastuzumab, with a median overall survival of 56.5 months versus 40.8 months, respectively. The final results were also published in NEJM on February 19, 2015. “The survival improvement of nearly 16 months … is unprecedented among studies of metastatic breast cancer,” said the study’s lead author, Sandra Swain, M.D., of Medstar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, DC. Patients in the trastuzumab-docetaxal group whose disease progressed were allowed to cross over to the pertuzumab-trastuzumab-docetaxel group, but the overall survival analysis was not adjusted for this crossover, Dr. Swain explained. “As such, this is a very conservative final analysis of survival.” The Food and Drug Administration approved pertuzumab on June 8, 2012, for use in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel to treat women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. This approval was based on the earlier progression-free survival results.  Updated:

Research   Patient  Health Professional  Research  Interim results from an international, randomized phase III trial suggest that the addition of a drug called carfilzomib (Kyprolis®) to a standard treatment improves outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma whose cancer has relapsed. Participants in the study who received carfilzomib plus lenalidomide (Revlimid®) and dexamethasone lived a median of 8.7 months longer without the disease getting worse than patients who received lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone. New England Journal of Medicine, December 6, 2014 (See the journal abstract.) Although survival rates have improved for patients with multiple myeloma, relapse is common, and new treatments are needed. In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration approved carfilzomib for the treatment of multiple myeloma that had worsened during or after treatment with bortezomib (Velcade®) and immunomodulatory therapy. Carfilzomib, which is given intravenously, is a type of drug called a proteasome inhibitor. Recent early-stage clinical trials have suggested that the addition of carfilzomib to a standard therapy for multiple myeloma—the combination of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone—may benefit some patients whose disease has relapsed or no longer responds to treatment. In the trials, the side effects of the three-drug combination were consistent with the known toxic effects of these agents. In a phase III clinical trial, researchers randomly assigned 792 patients with relapsed multiple myeloma to receive carfilzomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (carfilzomib group) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (control group). The patients were from North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Patients in each group received treatments in 28-day cycles until they withdrew consent, their disease progressed, or they experienced unacceptable toxic effects. Patients in the carfilzomib group continued to receive lenaolidomide and dexamethasone but stopped receiving carfilzomib after 18 cycles because data on the long-term safety of carfilzomib were not yet available when the study was initiated. The study’s primary end point was progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, the rate of overall response (partial response or better), duration of response, health-related quality of life, and safety. Keith Stewart, M.B., Ch.B., of the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, AZ, was the first author of the study, which was sponsored by the maker of carfilzomib, Onyx Pharmaceuticals. Median progression-free survival was 26.3 months in the carfilzomib group, compared with 17.6 months in the control group. The overall response rate—the percentage of patients whose cancers shrank or disappeared after treatment—was higher in the carfilzomib group than in the control group (87.1 percent versus 66.7 percent), including a complete response in 31.8 percent and 9.3 percent of patients in the two groups, respectively. Patients in the carfilzomib group reported a number of common adverse events at a higher rate than did patients in the control group, including diarrhea, cough, fever, and hypertension. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were reported in 83.7 percent and 80.7 percent of patients in the carfilzomab and control groups, respectively. The duration of treatment was longer in the carfilzomib group than in the control group (median, 88 weeks versus 57 weeks). Serious adverse events, including cardiac events, were reported more frequently during the first 18 cycles of treatment than in later cycles. Patients in the carfilzomib group remained in remission longer and reported superior health-related quality of life (according to the QLQ-C30 Global Health Status and Quality of Life scale) than those in the control group during the first 18 cycles of treatment. The median overall survival had not been reached in either group at the time of publication, although there was a statistical trend favoring the carfilzomib group. Additional results beyond this interim analysis will be needed to assess overall survival. As planned by the study designers, the trial did not collect data on the safety and efficacy of carfilzomib after 18 cycles. The complete response rate among the carfilzomib group “is particularly encouraging because studies have shown an association between more robust responses and improved survival in patients with multiple myeloma,” the study authors wrote. “Overall, I think this is a very important study,” said Mark Roschewski, M.D., of the Lymphoid Malignancies Branch in NCI’s Center for Cancer Research, who was not involved in the study. “We have enjoyed an onslaught of novel therapies in myeloma over the last 10 years, but the majority of clinical decisions are guided by phase II study results. The strength of the current study is the design as a randomized phase III controlled trial, which is needed to understand the best way to approach patients with multiple myeloma.” The current study offered a true comparison of the efficacy with the toxicity in a similar patient population. “I was pleasantly surprised to see that the level of toxicity did not seem to be increased significantly, and the complete response rate was much higher with the three-drug regimen,” Dr. Roschewski pointed out. “In my opinion, a complete response rate of over 30 percent in a group of patients that had been previously treated with novel agents in most cases is quite impressive.” Although it is unclear from the study results which patients benefit the most from the three-drug regimen and there was not a benefit with respect to overall survival, Dr. Roschewski concluded: “Given the favorable toxicity profile relative to the two-drug regimen, I think the three-drug regimen should be strongly considered in most patients.”  Posted:

Using TCGA   Program History  TCGA Cancers Selected for Study  Publications by TCGA  Using TCGA  What are head and neck cancers? Most head and neck cancers begin in the moist, mucus membranes lining the inside of the mouth, nose and throat. These membranes are made up of squamous cells and the head and neck cancers that grow in these cells are called squamous cell carcinomas. These cancers most often affect people over the age of 50 and the rates in men are more than twice as high as the rates in women.1 In 2010, about 36,000 Americans are estimated to have been diagnosed with head and neck cancers and an estimated 7,880 were expected have died of squamous cell carcinomas. Known risks for developing head and neck cancers are smoking and heavy drinking. Additional information on head and neck cancers. What have TCGA researchers learned about head and neck cancers? Head and neck cancers associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) and tobacco-smoking are molecularly distinct.

	The integration of HPV, a virus harboring oncoproteins E6 and E7 that cause HPV positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, is linked to increased somatic copy number variants.
HPV-positive tumors are also characterized by:
		Shortened or deleted TRAF3, a gene that codes for a protein that helps regulate the body’s immune response
Amplification of E2F1, a gene encoding a member of the E2F transcription factor family that is involved in cell cycle regulation
Mutations in PIK3CA

HPV-negative tumors contained novel co-amplifications of 11q13 and 11q22, an event that likely promotes the interaction of BIRC2 and FADD, genes that together work to inhibit cell death.
Smoking-related tumors featured TP53 mutations, CDKN2A inactivation, and frequent copy number alterations.  Molecular characteristics may help clinicians improve the specificity of the diagnosis and treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.
	Cell cycle proteins are altered in differently in HPV-positive and HPV-negative cancers, suggesting that treating these cancers should be treated according to their subtype.

Nelson, M.D., Ph.D., Director Baltimore,       Maryland Main: 410-955-5222 Visit Website Since its opening in 1973, the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University has led the world in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer and new ways to treat it. The strength of the center’s research and treatment programs was recognized early by NCI, who designated it as one of the first comprehensive cancer centers and recognizes it as a Center of Excellence. The center partnered with Allegheny Health Network in 2014. This collaboration fosters clinical accomplishments, medical education, and a broad range of cancer research initiatives. The Kimmel Cancer Center’s goals are to: decrease cancer incidence and deaths and improve the quality of life for those who have cancer,  excel in cutting-edge basic, translational, and clinical research and in the application of fundamental knowledge to prevent and cure cancer and to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer,  safely and compassionately provide the full range of evidence-based, preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, supportive, and patient-focused services to cancer patients and their families, and  lead cancer education of health professionals, scientists, patients and their families, and the community at large.  The Kimmel Cancer Center spans 35 departments and five schools across Johns Hopkins University. At the center of that growth is the center’s research component. How its investigators conduct research and translate those results aims directly at the core of the center’s mission: improved patient care. Investigators at the Kimmel Cancer Center focus on understanding how cancers grow and spread, new drug development, novel quantitative approaches to studying cancer and improving patient care, and dedicated research initiatives connected to proton therapy for adults and children. The center has established a Convergence Institute that unites the immense talent across Johns Hopkins to advance research for all cancers, with a specific focus on ensuring that these discoveries reach minorities and other underserved populations. Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy: In 1989, researchers at the Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute developed GVAX, the first therapeutic cancer vaccine. The institute has gone on to pioneer other leading therapies saving lives today and is working on the most promising therapies of tomorrow.  Blood and Bone Marrow Cancers: The Kimmel Cancer Center is a leader in the field of blood and bone marrow cancer treatment. In 1968, Johns Hopkins performed one of the first successful bone marrow transplants using an HLA-matched sibling donor. About a decade later, researchers at the center developed 4-HC, a drug that made self-donated bone marrow transplants possible.  Community Engagement: Kimmel Cancer Center’s Community Outreach and Engagement program works with community partners to ensure that all Maryland citizens have equal access to cancer prevention, treatment, and survivorship services. These partners help the center identify research priorities and help link communities to the Kimmel Cancer Center’s education and outreach efforts.  *This profile was provided by the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Symptoms can be caused by the location of the tumor or from the tumor pressing on brain tissue or the spinal cord and nerves. Brain and spine tumor signs and symptoms also can occur gradually over days or months or they can happen suddenly. Brain tumor symptoms may include: Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting  Seizures  Vision, hearing, and speech problems  Loss of appetite  Frequent nausea and vomiting  Changes in personality, mood, ability to focus, or behavior  Loss of balance and trouble walking  Weakness  Unusual sleepiness or change in activity level  Ependymoma Survivor and Caregivers’ Journey Spinal cord tumor symptoms may include: Back pain or pain that spreads from the back towards the arms or legs  A change in bowel habits or trouble urinating  Weakness or numbness in the arms or legs  Trouble walking  Dr. Edjah Nduom treats and studies rare brain and spine cancers. He shares his knowledge to help patients find specialized care for their tumor type. You should call your doctor if you have any symptoms that worry you. Your doctor will examine you, ask you questions, and perform a series of tests. The most common test to find out if you have a brain or spine tumor is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It takes detailed pictures of all parts of your brain or spine. If your test results show a tumor, it is important for you to find a doctor specially trained to treat your brain or spine tumor. You also want to find a doctor you can trust and feel comfortable with. The expertise of your doctor will also help you get an accurate diagnosis, so he or she can plan your treatment and coordinate your care with a better chance of success. To get an accurate diagnosis of your tumor type, you will need a biopsy. A biopsy is a surgical procedure to remove a piece of tumor tissue. The tumor tissue is usually removed during surgery to remove as much of your brain or spine tumor as possible to treat your cancer and relieve symptoms. And it is critical to find a neurosurgeon with extensive experience to perform your surgery. A neuropathologist will examine the tumor tissue to provide a diagnosis of your tumor type. NCI-CONNECT provides consultations for patients with rare central nervous system tumors free of charge. Your treating doctor or neuro-oncologist will use your diagnosis of your tumor to determine the best course of treatment after surgery. Treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapies or a clinical trial.

Rowley Professor of Cancer Research, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, The Ohio State University College of Medicine “For people struggling to make ends meet, the last thing on their minds is health care,” said Electra Paskett, who has devoted her 30-year career to addressing cancer disparities experienced by underserved groups in the United States. “The question we want to answer is how to reach them,” she said. Electra’s efforts to address cancer disparities through science and community partnerships, which NCI has supported over the last two decades, have led to important improvements in cancer screening and care in rural and low-income populations where cancer rates have remained stubbornly high. Populations in the Ohio Appalachian region and inner-city African Americans, in particular, have benefited from her studies. In the Appalachian areas of Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, the rates of lung, cervical, and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality are higher than anywhere else in the United States. “It’s all about figuring out why,” said Electra. To identify the causes of these disparities and develop ways to reduce them, she conducts research to develop and test interventions. Her approach includes partnership building with local clinicians and public health officials and, most importantly, with members of the community. “The people who live there in those communities know what strategies work best for them,” explained Electra. This community-based participatory research approach means she often takes road trips into the heart of Appalachian country. In these less-populous areas, she meets with locals, listens to their stories, and asks for their perspectives on how to address their higher-than-average cancer incidence and mortality rates. With their assistance, Electra has successfully pinpointed public health flaws and gaps. Her research has tested such initiatives as working with local churches to promote healthy eating and exercise, conducting outreach to parents and clinicians to improve rates of HPV vaccinations among adolescent girls, and implementing mammogram vans to make breast cancer screening more accessible. By working with communities and implementing culturally sensitive strategies, Electra has found that people will be more proactive about their health needs and even adopt healthier behaviors, such as regular cancer screenings, when appropriate programs and incentives are put into place.

Treatment by Stage  Childhood Stomach Cancer  Coping & Treatment Issues  Health Professional  Research   Treatment by Stage  Different types of treatments are available for stomach cancer. You and your cancer care team will work together to decide your treatment plan, which may include more than one type of treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as the stage of the cancer, your overall health, and your preferences. Your plan will include information about your cancer, the goals of treatment, your treatment options and the possible side effects, and the expected length of treatment. Talking with your cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect will be helpful. You’ll want to learn what you need to do before treatment begins, how you’ll feel while going through it, and what kind of help you will need. To learn more, see Questions to Ask Your Doctor about Your Treatment. For treatment by stage, see Stomach Cancer Treatment by Stage.  Endoscopic mucosal resection  Surgery  Radiation therapy  Chemotherapy  Targeted therapy  Immunotherapy  Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)  Clinical trials  Follow-up testing  Endoscopic mucosal resection Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Targeted therapy Immunotherapy Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) Clinical trials Follow-up testing Endoscopic mucosal resection Endoscopic mucosal resection is a procedure that uses an endoscope to remove carcinoma in situ and early-stage cancer from the lining of the digestive tract. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens and tools to remove tissue. Surgery Surgery is a common treatment for stomach cancer. The type of surgery depends on where the cancer is located. Other treatments may be given in addition to surgery: Treatment given before surgery is called preoperative therapy or neoadjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy may be given before surgery to shrink the tumor and reduce the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery. Chemoradiation given before surgery, to shrink the tumor, is being studied.  Treatment given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen, some patients may be given chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both to kill any cancer cells that are left.  Surgery, when used to treat cancer, is a procedure in which a surgeon removes cancer from your body. Learn the different ways that surgery is used against cancer and what you can expect before, during, and after surgery. Gastrectomy, the removal of part or all of the stomach, is the main surgery for stomach cancer: Subtotal gastrectomy is the removal of the part of the stomach that contains cancer, nearby lymph nodes, and parts of other tissues and organs near the tumor. The spleen may also be removed.  Total gastrectomy is the removal of the entire stomach, nearby lymph nodes, and parts of the esophagus, small intestine, and other tissues near the tumor. The spleen may also be removed. Then the surgeon attaches the esophagus to the small intestine so the patient can continue to eat and swallow.  Endoluminal stent placement may be done when the tumor blocks the passage into or out of the stomach. In this procedure, the surgeon places a stent (a thin, expandable tube) from the esophagus to the stomach or from the stomach to the small intestine to allow the patient to eat normally. Endoluminal laser therapy is a procedure in which an endoscope (a thin, lighted tube) with a laser attached is used as a knife to open a gastrointestinal blockage. Gastrojejunostomy is the removal of the part of the stomach with cancer that is blocking the opening into the small intestine. Then the surgeon connects the stomach to the jejunum (a part of the small intestine) to allow food and medicine to pass from the stomach into the small intestine. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. Stomach cancer is sometimes treated with external radiation therapy. This type of radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Learn more about External Beam Radiation Therapy for Cancer and Radiation Therapy Side Effects. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy (also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemotherapy for stomach cancer is usually systemic, meaning it is injected into a vein or given by mouth. When given this way, the drugs enter the bloodstream to reach cancer cells throughout the body. Chemotherapy drugs used to treat stomach cancer include capecitabine  cisplatin  docetaxel  doxorubicin  epirubicin  fluorouracil (5-FU)  irinotecan  leucovorin  oxaliplatin  paclitaxel  trifluridine/tipiracil  To learn more about how chemotherapy works, how it is given, common side effects, and more, see Chemotherapy to Treat Cancer and Chemotherapy and You: Support for People With Cancer. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Your doctor may suggest biomarker tests to help predict your response to certain targeted therapy drugs. Learn more about Biomarker Testing for Cancer. Targeted therapies used to treat stomach cancer include ramucirumab  regorafenib  trastuzumab  trastuzumab deruxtecan  Learn more about Targeted Therapy to Treat Cancer. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy helps a person’s immune system fight cancer. Your doctor may suggest biomarker tests to help predict your response to certain immunotherapy drugs. Learn more about Biomarker Testing for Cancer. Immunotherapy drugs used to treat stomach cancer include nivolumab  pembrolizumab  These drugs work in more than one way to kill cancer cells. They are also considered targeted therapy because they target specific changes or substances in cancer cells. Learn more about Immunotherapy to Treat Cancer and Immunotherapy Side Effects. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) Regional chemotherapy is a method of placing chemotherapy directly into an organ or a body cavity, such as the abdomen, to mainly affect cancer cells in those areas. A type of regional chemotherapy called hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, or hot chemotherapy, is being studied to treat stomach cancer and may be offered at certain treatment centers. After the surgeon has removed as much of the cancer as possible during surgery, a chemotherapy drug, such as mitomycin or cisplatin, is warmed and pumped directly into the peritoneal cavity through a thin tube for about 2 hours. The surgeon then drains the chemotherapy from the abdomen and rinses the abdomen before closing the incision. Clinical trials A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be an option. Use our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done.

Human papillomavirus infection may increase the risk of developing penile cancer. Signs of penile cancer include sores, discharge, and bleeding. Tests that examine the penis are used to diagnose penile cancer. Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The penis is a rod-shaped male reproductive organ that passes sperm and urine from the body. It contains two types  of erectile tissue (spongy tissue with blood vessels that fill with blood to make an erection): Corpora cavernosa: The two columns of erectile tissue that form most of the penis. Corpus spongiosum: The single column of erectile tissue that forms a small portion of the penis. The corpus spongiosum surrounds the urethra (the tube through which urine and sperm pass from the body). The erectile tissue is wrapped in connective tissue and covered with skin. The glans (head of the penis) is covered with loose skin called the foreskin. EnlargeAnatomy of the penis. The parts of the penis are the base, shaft, glans, and foreskin. The tissues that make up the penis include the dorsal nerve, blood vessels, connective tissue, and erectile tissue (corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum). The urethra passes from the bladder to the tip of the penis. Anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop penile cancer, and it will develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for penile cancer 
         include the following: Being uncircumcised. Circumcision may help prevent infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). A circumcision is an operation in which the doctor removes part or all of the foreskin from the penis. Many boys are circumcised shortly after birth. Men who were not circumcised at birth may have a higher risk of developing penile cancer. Being age 60 or older. Having phimosis (a condition in which the foreskin of the penis cannot be pulled back over the glans). Having poor personal hygiene. Having many sexual partners. Using tobacco products. These and other signs may be caused by penile cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following: Redness, irritation, or a sore on the penis. A lump on the penis. In addition to asking about your personal and family health history and doing a physical exam, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures: Physical exam of the penis: An exam in which the doctor checks the penis for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue sample is removed during one of the following procedures: Incisional biopsy: The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue that doesn't look normal.Excisional biopsy: The removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesn’t look normal. Incisional biopsy: The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue that doesn't look normal. Excisional biopsy: The removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesn’t look normal. The prognosis and treatment options depend on the following: The stage of the cancer. The location and size of the tumor. Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back). After penile cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the penis or to other parts of the body. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. The following stages are used for penile cancer: Stage 0Stage IStage IIStage IIIStage IV Penile cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated. Stage 0 Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the penis or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process: CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the pelvis, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. When this procedure is done at the same time as a CT scan, it is called a PET/CT scan. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Ultrasound exam:  A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue sample is removed during one of the following procedures: Sentinel lymph node biopsy: The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node in a group of lymph nodes to receive lymphatic drainage from the primary tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor.  A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor.  The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes.  The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed.   A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.  If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes.Lymph node dissection: A procedure to remove one or more lymph nodes in the groin during surgery. A sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called a lymphadenectomy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy: The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node in a group of lymph nodes to receive lymphatic drainage from the primary tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor.  A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor.  The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes.  The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed.   A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.  If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes. Lymph node dissection: A procedure to remove one or more lymph nodes in the groin during surgery. A sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called a lymphadenectomy. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  penile cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually penile cancer cells. The disease is metastatic penile cancer, not lung cancer. Stage 0 is divided into stages 0is and 0a. In stage 0is, abnormal cells are found on the surface of the skin of the penis. These abnormal cells form growths that may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0is is also called carcinoma in situ or penile intraepithelial neoplasia. In stage 0a, squamous cell cancer that does not spread is found on the surface of the skin of the penis or on the underneath surface of the foreskin of the penis. Stage 0a is also called noninvasive localized squamous cell carcinoma. In stage I, cancer has formed and spread to tissue just under the skin of the penis. Cancer has not spread to lymph vessels, blood vessels, or nerves. The cancer cells look more like normal cells under a microscope. Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB. In stage IIA, cancer has spread: to tissue just under the skin of the penis. Cancer has spread to lymph vessels, blood vessels, and/or nerves; or to tissue just under the skin of the penis. Under a microscope, the cancer cells look very abnormal or the cells are sarcomatoid; or into the corpus spongiosum (spongy erectile tissue in the shaft and glans that fills with blood to make an erection). In stage IIB, cancer has spread: through the layer of connective tissue that surrounds the corpus cavernosum and into the corpus cavernosum (spongy erectile tissue that runs along the shaft of the penis). Stage III is divided into stages IIIA and stage IIIB. Cancer is found in the penis. In stage IIIA, cancer has spread to 1 or 2 lymph nodes on one side of the groin. In stage IIIB, cancer has spread to 3 or more lymph nodes on one side of the groin or to lymph nodes on both sides of the groin. In stage IV, cancer has spread: to tissues near the penis, such as the scrotum, prostate, or pubic bone, and may have spread to lymph nodes in the groin or pelvis; or to one or more lymph nodes in the pelvis, or cancer has spread through the outer covering of the lymph nodes to nearby tissue; or to lymph nodes outside the pelvis or to other parts of the body, such as the lung, liver, or bone. The cancer may come back in the penis or in other parts of the body. There are different types of treatment for patients with penile cancer. The following types of treatment are used:SurgeryRadiation therapyChemotherapyImmunotherapy New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.RadiosensitizersSentinel lymph node biopsy followed by surgery Treatment for penile cancer may cause side effects. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Follow-up tests may be needed. Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Immunotherapy Radiosensitizers Sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by surgery Different types of treatments are available for patients with penile cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.    A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Surgery is the most common treatment for all stages of penile cancer. A doctor may remove the cancer using one of the following operations: Mohs microsurgery: A procedure in which the tumor is cut from the skin in thin layers. During the  surgery, the edges of the tumor and each layer of tumor removed are viewed through a microscope to check for cancer cells. Layers continue to be removed until no more cancer cells are seen. This type of surgery removes as little normal tissue as possible and is often used to remove cancer on the skin. 


It is also called Mohs surgery.EnlargeMohs surgery. A surgical procedure to remove a visible lesion on the skin in several steps. First, a thin layer of cancerous tissue is removed. Then, a second thin layer of tissue is removed and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells. More layers are removed one at a time until the tissue viewed under a microscope shows no remaining cancer. This type of surgery is used to remove as little normal tissue as possible. Laser surgery: A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface lesion such as a tumor. Cryosurgery:  A treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy. Circumcision: Surgery to remove part or all of the foreskin of the penis. Wide local excision: Surgery to remove only the cancer and some normal tissue around it. Amputation of the penis:  Surgery to remove part or all of the penis. If part of the penis is removed, it is a partial penectomy. If all of the penis is removed, it is a total penectomy. Lymph nodes in the groin may be taken out during surgery. After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.  External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat penile cancer. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly onto the skin (topical chemotherapy), the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).  The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Topical chemotherapy may be used  to treat stage 0 penile cancer. See Drugs Approved for Penile Cancer for more information. Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.   Topical  immunotherapy with imiquimod may be used  to treat stage 0 penile cancer. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers helps kill more tumor cells. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node in a group of lymph nodes to receive lymphatic drainage from the primary tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor.  A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor.  The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes.  The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed.   A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.  If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes. After the sentinel lymph node biopsy, the surgeon removes the cancer. For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, visit our Side Effects page. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. As you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or checkups. Some tests that were done to diagnose or stage the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish. PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of penile cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board. A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

Director, Biopathology Center, Nationwide Children’s Hospital Biobanking is where everything comes together, says Dr. Nilsa Ramirez (she/her). Information about a patient’s clinical evaluation and laboratory data from their samples are connected and stored—or banked—with the samples in one place. “If you look at clinical and lab data together,” said Nilsa, “you can generate more information that leads to greater discoveries.” Her center houses specimens for several members of NCI’s National Clinical Trials Network and validates CCDI Molecular Characterization Initiative samples. With childhood cancer data, she hopes to see a future where the analysis of even a tiny sample of tissue, such as a tumor biopsy, is maximized. Ultimately, she says, all these data collected can guide pathologists like her in doing more with smaller samples. Outside of the lab, Nilsa reads biographies and when the weather is nice, she can be seen with her husband on his Harley motorcycle.  Posted:

Research Articles   Research Articles  Summary Results from an international phase III trial show that sorafenib (Nexavar®) may benefit  patients with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer that is no longer responding to treatment with radioactive iodine. Patients who were treated with sorafenib lived longer without their cancers getting worse than patients who received a placebo. Source The Lancet, April 24, 2014. (See the journal abstract.) Background Approximately 95 percent of thyroid cancers are classified as either the papillary or the follicular type, both of which arise from follicular cells of the thyroid. The cells of these tumors are well differentiated (that is, they appear similar to normal thyroid cells) and tend to grow more slowly than cells of the rarer, more aggressive medullary and anaplastic types of thyroid cancer. Both papillary and follicular thyroid cancers are considered highly treatable; they respond well to standard treatment, which includes surgery and radioactive iodine therapy. A small percentage of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, however, develop metastatic disease that does not respond to treatment with radioactive iodine (refractory disease). The treatment options for patients who develop radioactive iodine-refractory metastatic disease are very limited. No therapy has been shown to extend the survival of these patients; only 10 to 20 percent of patients with radioactive iodine-refractory metastatic disease are still alive 10 years after diagnosis. Laboratory studies have identified several changes in tumor cells that are associated with the development and progression of thyroid cancer. These include mutations in the BRAF and RAS genes that lead to chronic activation of their protein products (cell growth-promoting kinases), and increased production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that stimulates the development of new blood vessels needed to support tumor growth, and its receptors, the VEGFRs. Sorafenib, a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat some patients with kidney and liver cancer, inhibits the activities of the VEGFR and B-RAF proteins. Moreover, several early-phase clinical trials suggested that sorafenib may be effective in treating patients with radioactive iodine-refractory metastatic thyroid cancer. The Study The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled DECISION trial enrolled 417 patients with radioactive iodine-refractory locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer that had progressed in the prior 14 months. This international trial included patients with papillary, follicular, and poorly differentiated disease from Europe, Asia, and the United States. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 400 mg of sorafenib taken orally twice daily or a placebo. Patients assigned to the placebo group whose disease progressed during the trial could "cross over" and receive sorafenib. The primary endpoint of the trial was the length of time patients lived after starting treatment without their disease getting worse (progression-free survival), as assessed by independent review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival and objective response rate. The trial was led by Marcia Brose, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Pennsylvania Abramson Cancer Center. Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals and Onyx Pharmaceuticals funded the trial. Results Progression-free survival was statistically significantly longer in patients treated with sorafenib than in those who received a placebo: 10.8 months versus 5.8 months. This benefit in progression-free survival was observed regardless of patient age, the extent of disease, or the sites of metastases. None of the patients had a complete response. The objective response rate—the percentage of patients whose tumors had measurable reductions in size following treatment—was 12 percent in the sorafenib group and less than 1 percent in the placebo group. Overall survival did not differ between the patients treated with sorafenib and those who received a placebo. Among patients with no objective response, nearly 42 percent in the sorafenib group had stable disease for at least 6 months after beginning treatment, compared with 33 percent of those in the placebo group. Approximately 70 percent of patients in the trial’s placebo group crossed over and began receiving sorafenib when their cancer began to progress. Information on BRAF and RAS mutations in the patients' tumor tissue was available for 61 percent of all patients in the trial (126 patients in the sorafenib group and 130 patients in the placebo group). Mutations in these genes were not associated with longer progression-free survival in patients treated with sorafenib. Nearly all of the patients treated with sorafenib experienced side effects. The side effects were mainly low-grade and included hand-foot skin reactions, diarrhea, skin rash, fatigue, and hair loss. Nevertheless, nearly two-thirds of patients in the sorafenib group had their treatment temporarily halted or the drug dose reduced, and nearly 19 percent stopped treatment altogether because of side effects. Approximately 37 percent of the patients in the sorafenib group and 26 percent of the patients in the placebo group had a serious adverse event. Serious adverse events in the sorafenib group included the development of a second primary cancer, difficulty breathing, and pleural effusion. One death, caused by a heart attack, was also attributed to sorafenib. On November 22, 2013, the FDA approved sorafenib for the treatment of patients with radioactive iodine-refractory metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer based on results from the DECISION trial. Limitations Having a new FDA-approved drug for patients with radioactive iodine-refractory metastatic thyroid cancer "is good news for patients," said Electron Kebebew, M.D., an expert on endocrine cancers at NCI's Center for Cancer Research. But, he noted, sorafenib can have substantial side effects and, in some patients with radioactive iodine-refractory metastatic thyroid cancer, the disease progresses slowly and immediate treatment may not be necessary. To help guide clinical decision making, he suggested, "it would have been good to know how rapidly the disease progressed in these patients, and whether those with the most rapidly progressive disease were more likely to respond to treatment given that there were no complete responses and only 12 percent had a partial response." Although it is important to delay disease progression, Dr. Kebebew continued, it is unclear whether sorafenib improves overall survival. "That's important information to patients and clinicians," he said. Comments The results of the DECISION trial "establish a new standard of care for progressive radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer," wrote Sigurdis Haraldsdottir, M.D., and Manisha Shah, M.D., of the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, in an accompanying comment in The Lancet. Because so many patients in the placebo group crossed over and began receiving sorafenib, they continued, the "absence of a benefit in overall survival is not surprising." Overall, Drs. Haraldsdottir and Shah noted, the side effects seen in the DECISION trial were consistent with those experienced with sorafenib in other clinical trials. "[C]linicians should be aware of the class effects" of drugs like sorafenib that target multiple kinases, they cautioned. These effects can include "rare serious toxicities such as bleeding, thromboembolism, bowel perforation, and left ventricle dysfunction," Drs. Haraldsdottir and Shah explained. "Close monitoring, early recognition, and management of adverse events are therefore essential when patients are being treated with sorafenib." Finding the right balance between treatment and side effects is required when using sorafenib in these patients, Dr. Kebebew stressed. "You have to find a threshold," he said, "because when you’re looking at a drug with this side-effect profile, you may want to delay using it until the disease is progressing rapidly."  Posted:

Past Programs  Funding  Researcher Resources  News & Events  About DCB  Progress   Past Programs  CSBC Investigator Andrea Bild, Ph.D., is a Professor in the Division of Molecular Pharmacology at City of Hope Medical Center. She is an avid hiker who has trekked up mountains in Utah and Colorado to admire the beauty of nature. Similarly, as a scientist and cancer researcher, she has set out on a journey to understand the complex landscape of cancer. In college at the University of Florida, she volunteered in a lab that studied immune cell signaling. This experience led her to pursue a Ph.D. in Pharmacology at the University of Colorado focused on oncogenic signaling in breast cancer. Although computational tools for sophisticated data analysis were just emerging during her time as a graduate student, Andrea recognized the potential of these informatics technologies for the exploration of tumors. Thus, as an independent investigator, she developed approaches to analyze vast amounts of data to identify coordinated patterns of oncogenic signaling. In this interview, she shares her perspectives on cancer systems biology, tumor heterogeneity, and computational tools for cancer research. Scientists get to work on challenging, complex puzzles that have the potential to help people, and we get to work with great colleagues. During my undergraduate studies, I considered other fields, such as zoology and organic chemistry; however, I landed on cancer biology due to the positive experience in my volunteer research with signal transduction and my desire to help cancer patients. Cross-train with other disciplines. Go to tumor board meetings with clinicians to learn their perspective on patient treatment and engage with the mathematics community to understand how they like to approach scientific problems. By working across disciplines effectively, you can accomplish broader goals. With single cell technologies, we now can define exactly what level of heterogeneity we need to address in complex cancers, such as breast and ovarian cancer, for the development of effective treatment strategies. It’s important to understand tumor heterogeneity to effectively treat cancer cells that survive cancer therapy and continue to grow. Currently, clinicians are not treating different subclones or the diversity of a tumor. Having a more comprehensive understanding of tumors and treating the heterogeneity could lead to better patient outcomes. We use systems biology since it allows us to study the diverse ecosystem and complexity of a tumor. By utilizing these approaches, we can understand genomic profiles of individual tumor cells, use computational algorithms to characterize the diversity of each subclone within a tumor, and build models for predictive treatment. I always work with mathematicians and statisticians to develop computational tools for cancer biology. My role is to help identify unmet needs related to tumor heterogeneity data. My research team is creating tools, like an integration projection model and new mathematical approaches, to understand large, single-cell genomic data sets, cell phenotypes, and subclones in tumors. With Dr. Evan Johnson, we helped to develop ASSIGN (Adaptive Signature Selection and InteGratioN) and GSOA (Gene Set Omic Analysis), which analyze complex data and make sense of signaling pathways. Also, some of our predictive models allow us to make assessments on the efficacy of clinical cancer therapies. Cells in treatment-resistant tumors may have common vulnerabilities. We found that common phenotypes, such as a mesenchymal phenotype, emerge in tumors that stop responding to chemotherapy. Thus, drugs targeting pathways of cellular mesenchymal states, like AXL or cancer stem cell signaling inhibitors, may prevent or reverse this drug resistant phenotype from developing in tumor cells. Targeting a phenotype versus a single mutation or gene target may improve our ability to match drug to tumor. Once we have an actionable finding, for example a treatment regimen that our data indicates will benefit patients, we engage the medical oncologists that are a part of our scientific team. These collaborators will write up and enact a clinical trial protocol based on our collaborative research. Our research group continues to be part of the process, and performs correlative science experiments with the clinical trial. Our team has worked together for over a decade, and we are looking forward to developing phenotype-targeting trials that help cancer patients.

General Information About Esophageal Cancer  Esophageal Cancer Prevention  About This PDQ Summary  Cancer prevention is action taken to lower the chance of getting 
         cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer 
         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower 
         the number of deaths caused by cancer. To prevent new cancers from starting, scientists look at risk 
         factors and protective factors. Anything that increases your 
         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; 
         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is 
         called a cancer protective factor. Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. 
         For example, both smoking and inheriting certain genes are 
         risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be 
         avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy diet may be protective 
         factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and 
         increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does 
         not mean that you will not get cancer. Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied. Esophageal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)
		  cells form in the tissues of the esophagus. Esophageal cancer is found more often in men. The esophagus is the hollow, muscular tube that moves food and
		  liquid from the throat to the stomach. The wall of the esophagus is made up of several layers of tissue,
		  including mucous membrane (inner lining), muscle, and connective tissue. Esophageal cancer
		  starts in the inner lining of the esophagus and spreads outward through the
		  other layers as it grows.EnlargeThe esophagus and stomach are part of the upper gastrointestinal (digestive) system. The two most common types of esophageal cancer are named for the
		  type of cells that become malignant (cancerous): Squamous cell carcinoma: Cancer that forms in the thin, flat cells lining the inside of the esophagus. This cancer is most often found
			 in the upper and middle part of the esophagus but can occur anywhere along the esophagus. This is also called epidermoid
			 carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma: Cancer that begins in
			 glandular cells.
			 Glandular cells in the lining of the esophagus produce and release fluids such
			 as mucus. Adenocarcinoma usually  starts in the lower part of the esophagus, near
			 the stomach. See the following PDQ summaries  for more information about esophageal cancer: Esophageal Cancer Screening Esophageal Cancer Treatment (Adult) Rates of esophageal cancer and deaths from esophageal cancer have decreased slightly over recent years. Men are about three times more likely than women to develop esophageal cancer. The chance of developing esophageal cancer increases with age. White men develop esophageal cancer at higher rates than Black men in all age groups. In comparison, rates are higher in Black women through 69 years and higher in White women aged 70 years and older. Deaths from esophageal cancer  are higher for White men compared with Black men at all ages, while deaths are higher in Black women than in White women. In the United States, the rates  of  adenocarcinoma of the esophagus have increased in the last 20 years. It is now more common  than  squamous  cell carcinoma of the esophagus. The rates of squamous  cell carcinoma of the esophagus are decreasing, but remain much higher in Black men than in White men. Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer. The following risk factors increase 
         the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus:Smoking and alcohol use The following protective factors may 
         decrease the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus: Avoiding tobacco and alcohol useChemoprevention with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs The following risk factors increase 
         the risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus:Gastric reflux The following protective factors may 
         decrease the risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Chemoprevention with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsRadiofrequency ablation of the esophagus Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways 
    to prevent cancer. New ways to prevent esophageal cancer are being studied in clinical 
     trials. Smoking and alcohol use Avoiding tobacco and alcohol use Chemoprevention with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs Gastric reflux Chemoprevention with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs Radiofrequency ablation of the esophagus Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, having overweight, and not getting enough exercise.  Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer. The risk factors and protective factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus are not the same. Studies have shown that the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is increased in people who smoke or drink a lot. Studies have shown that  the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is lower in people who do not use tobacco and alcohol. Chemoprevention is the use of drugs, vitamins, or other agents to try to reduce the risk of cancer. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  include aspirin and other drugs that reduce swelling and pain. Some studies have shown that the use of NSAIDs  

 may lower the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. However, the use of NSAIDs increases the risk of heart attack, heart failure, stroke,  bleeding in the stomach and intestines, and kidney      damage. Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is strongly linked to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), especially when the GERD lasts a long time and severe symptoms occur daily. GERD is a condition in which the contents of the stomach, including stomach acid, flow up  into the lower part of the esophagus. This  irritates the inside of the esophagus, and over time, may affect the cells lining the lower part of the esophagus. This condition is called Barrett esophagus. Over time, the affected cells are replaced with abnormal cells, which may later become adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Obesity in combination with GERD may further increase the risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. The use of medicines that relax the lower sphincter muscle of the esophagus may  increase  the likelihood of developing GERD. When the lower sphincter muscle is relaxed, stomach acid may flow up into the lower part of the esophagus. It is not known if surgery or other medical treatment to stop gastric reflux lowers the risk of  adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Clinical trials are being done to see if surgery or medical treatments can prevent Barrett esophagus. Chemoprevention is the use of drugs, vitamins, or other agents to try to reduce the risk of cancer.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) include aspirin and other drugs that reduce swelling and pain. Some studies have shown that the use of NSAIDs  

 may lower the risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. However, the use  of NSAIDs increases the risk of heart attack, heart failure, stroke,  bleeding in the stomach and intestines, and kidney      damage. Patients with Barrett esophagus who have abnormal cells in the lower esophagus may be treated with radiofrequency ablation. This procedure  uses radio waves to heat and destroy abnormal cells, which may become cancer. Risks of using radiofrequency ablation include narrowing of the esophagus and bleeding in the esophagus, stomach, or intestines. One study of patients who have Barrett esophagus and abnormal cells in the esophagus compared patients who received radiofrequency ablation with patients who did not. Patients who received radiofrequency ablation were less likely to be diagnosed with esophageal cancer. More study is needed in order to know whether radiofrequency ablation decreases the risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus in  patients with these conditions. Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to 
         lower the risk of  certain types of cancer. Some 
         cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who 
         have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. 
         Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had 
         cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type 
         or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. 
         Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known 
         to have any risk factors for cancer. The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to 
         find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These 
         may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting 
         smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or 
         food supplements. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage.

T!tle : ComboMATCH will test new combinations of cancer drugs - NCI

d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  NCI’s ComboMATCH initiative will test new drug combinations guided by tumor biology   News Releases   Posted:
June 1, 2023  240-760-6600 ComboMATCH will test combinations of drugs that target specific cancer mutations. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has launched a large precision medicine cancer initiative to test the effectiveness of treating adults and children with new drug combinations that target specific tumor alterations. Known as the Combination Therapy Platform Trial with Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (ComboMATCH), the initiative is the largest of its kind to test combinations of cancer drugs guided by tumor biology. The endeavor aims to identify promising treatments that can advance to larger, more definitive clinical trials outside of ComboMATCH. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health. ComboMATCH comprises numerous phase 2 treatment trials that will each evaluate a drug combination—usually either two targeted drugs or a targeted drug plus a chemotherapy drug. Some trials will include patients with specific changes in their cancer cells, no matter where the cancer arose in the body, whereas others will enroll patients with specific cancer types. “The majority of treatments that patients get nowadays are not genomically determined,” said James H. Doroshow, M.D., director of NCI’s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. “With ComboMATCH, we’re trying to show that genomic abnormalities can be used to determine the most effective treatment combinations for patients.” ComboMATCH (NCT05564377) is a cross-group collaboration among NCI and all five U.S. clinical trial groups within NCI’s National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). ComboMATCH is a successor to NCI-MATCH, NCI’s groundbreaking precision medicine clinical trial. In NCI-MATCH, people were assigned to treatment based on genetic changes in their tumor rather than their type of cancer. For the most part, NCI-MATCH evaluated single drugs targeting the mutation thought to be driving the growth of a patient’s tumor. However, many patients quickly developed resistance to these single drugs. “With ComboMATCH, we’re hoping that by attacking both the genetic driver and the mechanisms of resistance, we will obtain more durable clinical responses and more benefit to patients,” said Jeffrey Moscow, M.D., of the Investigational Drug Branch in NCI’s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis and a co-leader of ComboMATCH. The combinations will include both U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and investigational agents contributed by pharmaceutical companies. Hundreds of thousands of potential drug combinations exist, so one challenge has been to narrow down and prioritize the most promising ones. The overarching ComboMATCH coordination effort is led by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group. All five U.S. NCTN groups, which include the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, Children’s Oncology Group, ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, NRG Oncology, and SWOG Cancer Research Network, will lead ComboMATCH treatment trials. “An important strength of the study is that the combinations being evaluated in ComboMATCH will be based on preclinical data showing that indeed the combination is better than either agent alone, as well as safety data from phase 1 studies,” said James Ford, M.D., of Stanford University School of Medicine, a co-leader of ComboMATCH and lead investigator on the coordination effort by ECOG-ACRIN. "There will be agreement among all the NCTN trial group representatives to evaluate each combination.” There are several ways in which patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors will be identified for possible participation in ComboMATCH. In recent years, genomic testing of tumors has become a standard part of care for people with many cancer types. A doctor at any of the community hospitals and cancer centers participating in ComboMATCH can refer their patient for additional eligibility screening if the patient’s test results show that they have a particular alteration being investigated in one of the treatment trials. Any one of the nearly 35 designated commercial and academic labs that are conducting genomic testing as part of standard of care can also identify patients who might be eligible for a ComboMATCH trial. Patients who are matched to a trial will be asked to provide a pretreatment tumor biopsy specimen for genomic profiling. This will enable ComboMATCH investigators to later probe other questions, such as why some treatments worked and others didn’t. Three ComboMATCH trials are already open for enrollment: A study testing the use of fulvestrant (Faslodex) and binimetinib (Mektovi) in patients with an NF1 mutation in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer that has spread (NCT05554354)  A study testing the use of selumetinib (Koselugo) and olaparib (Lynparza) or selumetinib alone in women with a RAS mutation who have endometrial or ovarian cancer that has come back or persists despite treatment (NCT05554328)  A study of chemotherapy plus ipatasertib in patients with AKT mutations who have solid tumors that have spread (NCT05554380)  Six additional trials will be available in the coming months, with more to be added over time. Overall, NCI plans for ComboMATCH to include about 2,000 patients, but that number could grow. Unlike NCI-MATCH, which did not include children, but rather had a separate parallel trial called PediatricMATCH, some ComboMATCH trials will include children with cancer. NCI will be launching two additional precision medicine cancer treatment trials. ImmunoMATCH has started with a pilot study to determine how prospective characterization of the immune status of a tumor can be used to improve the response to targeted treatments using immunotherapy, with plans to expand into larger studies in the future. MyeloMATCH will test treatments based on genetic changes in the cancer cells of people with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.

THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE, PART OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, HAS LAUNCHED A LARGE PRECISION MEDICINE CANCER INITIATIVE TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TREATING ADULTS AND CHILDREN WITH NEW DRUG COMBINATIONS THAT TARGET SPECIFIC CANCEROUS TUMOR ALTERATIONS. KNOWN AS THE COMBINATION THERAPY PLATFORM TRIAL WITH MOLECULAR ANALYSIS FOR THERAPY CHOICE – OR COMBOMATCH FOR SHORT -- THE INITIATIVE IS THE LARGEST OF ITS KIND TO TEST COMBINATIONS OF CANCER DRUGS GUIDED BY TUMOR BIOLOGY. DR. JEFFREY MOSCOW IN THE N-C-I’S DIVISION OF CANCER TREATMENT AND DIAGNOSIS SAYS THAT THE ENDEAVOR AIMS TO IDENTIFY PROMISING TREATMENTS THAT CAN ADVANCE TO LARGER, MORE DEFINITIVE CLINICAL TRIALS OUTSIDE OF COMBOMATCH: DR. MOSCOW SOUNDBITE:
“THE MAJORITY OF TREATMENTS THAT PATIENTS GET NOWADAYS ARE NOT GENOMICALLY DETERMINED – OR IN OTHER WORDS TAILORED TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL TUMOR D-N-A. WE’RE TRYING TO SHOW THAT GENOMIC ABNORMALITIES CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT COMBINATIONS FOR PATIENTS. WITH COMBOMATCH, WE’RE HOPING THAT BY ATTACKING BOTH THE GENETIC DRIVER AND THE MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCE, WE WILL OBTAIN MORE DURABLE CLINICAL RESPONSES AND MORE BENEFIT TO PATIENTS.” TAGLINE/OUTRO:
DR. MOSCOW NOTES THAT THREE COMBOMATCH TRIALS ARE ALREADY OPEN FOR ENROLLMENT, AND SIX MORE WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE COMING MONTHS. OVERALL, N-C-I PLANS FOR COMBOMATCH TO INCLUDE ABOUT 2,000 PATIENTS, BUT THAT NUMBER COULD GROW.

There are several types of malignant ovarian tumors. Having Ollier disease or certain syndromes may increase the risk of ovarian cancer. Signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer include pain, swelling, or a lump in the abdomen. Tests that examine the ovaries are used to help diagnose ovarian  cancer. The ovaries are a pair of organs in the female reproductive system. They are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped organ where a fetus grows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond in an adult woman. The ovaries produce eggs and female hormones (chemicals that control the way certain cells or organs function). Most ovarian tumors in children are benign (not cancer). They occur most often in females aged 15 to 19 years. The types of malignant ovarian tumors include the following: Germ cell tumors: Tumors that start in egg cells in females. These are the most common ovarian tumors in girls. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors Treatment for more information on ovarian germ cell  tumors.) Epithelial tumors: Tumors that start in the tissue covering the ovary. These are the second most common ovarian tumors in girls. 
Ovarian epithelial cancer is usually found at an early stage in children and is easier to treat than in adult patients. Stromal tumors: Tumors that begin in stromal cells, which make up  tissues that surround and support the ovaries. Juvenile granulosa cell tumors and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors are two types of stromal tumors. Small cell carcinoma of the ovary: Cancer that begins in the ovary and may have spread to the abdomen, pelvis, or other parts of the body. This type of ovarian cancer is fast growing and has a poor prognosis. This summary is about ovarian non-germ cell tumors (epithelial tumors, stromal tumors, and small cell carcinoma of the ovary). Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child’s doctor if you think your child may be at risk. The risk of ovarian cancer is increased by having one of the following conditions: Ollier disease (a disorder that causes abnormal growth of cartilage at the end of long bones). Maffucci syndrome (a disorder that causes abnormal growth of cartilage at the end of long bones  and of blood vessels in the skin). Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (a disorder that causes polyps to form in the intestines and dark spots to form on the mouth and fingers). Familial pleuropulmonary blastoma syndrome (a disorder that may cause cystic nephroma, lung cysts, thyroid problems, and cancers of the lung, kidney, ovary, and soft tissue). DICER1 syndrome (a disorder that may cause a goiter, polyps in the colon,  and tumors of the ovary, cervix, testicle, kidney, brain, eye, and lining of the lung). These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by ovarian cancer or by other conditions. Check with your child’s doctor if your child has any of the following: Pain  or swelling in the abdomen. A lump in the abdomen. Constipation. Painful or missed menstrual periods. Unusual vaginal bleeding. Male sex traits, such as body hair or a deep voice. Early signs of puberty. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and health history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the pelvis or abdomen, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.EnlargeComputed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet and radio waves to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the pelvis or abdomen.  The pictures are made by a computer.  This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).EnlargeMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs in the abdomen or pelvis and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. Biopsy: The tissue removed during surgery is viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Serum tumor marker test: A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), CEA, CA-125, and others are used to diagnose ovarian cancer. During surgery to remove the tumor, fluid in the abdomen will be checked for signs of cancer. The process used to find out if cancer has spread from the ovary to nearby areas or to other parts of the body is called staging. There is no standard system for staging childhood ovarian cancer. The results of tests and procedures done to diagnose ovarian cancer are used to help make decisions about treatment. Sometimes childhood ovarian cancer recurs (comes back) after treatment. There are different types of treatment for children and adolescents with ovarian cancer. Children and adolescents with ovarian cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer. Five types of standard treatment are used for ovarian cancer.SurgeryRadiation therapyChemotherapyHigh-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescueTargeted therapy Treatment for childhood ovarian cancer may cause side effects. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Follow-up tests may be needed. Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue Targeted therapy Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.  A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment. Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health professionals who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. This may include the following specialists and others: Pediatrician. Pediatric surgeon. Gynecologist. Pediatric nurse specialist. Rehabilitation specialist. Social worker. Psychologist. Surgery is used to remove the cancer in the ovary. Surgery may also be used to remove the cancer and the  ovary or the cancer and the ovary and  fallopian tube. Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.     When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can affect cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). High doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cell rescue is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy and radiation therapy do. Histone methyltransferase inhibitors: This type of targeted therapy slows down the cancer cell's ability to grow and divide. Tazemetostat is used to treat ovarian cancer. Targeted therapy is also being studied for the treatment of childhood ovarian cancer that has recurred (come back). To learn more about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, visit Side Effects. Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Physical problems, such as problems with fertility, are a late effect of treatment. Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments.  See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or checkups. Some tests that were done to diagnose or stage the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). For more information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section. Treatment of newly diagnosed benign ovarian tumors in children may include the following: Surgery. For more information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section. Treatment of newly diagnosed ovarian epithelial cancer in children may include the following: Surgery. Radiation therapy. Chemotherapy.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish. PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood ovarian cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board. A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website. For more information, call the Cancer Information Service (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237). PDQ is a registered trademark. The content of PDQ documents can be used freely as text. It cannot be identified as an NCI PDQ cancer information summary unless the whole summary is shown and it is updated regularly.

Radon is a radioactive gas that is released from the normal decay of the elements uranium, thorium, and radium in rocks and soil. The invisible, odorless gas seeps up through the ground and diffuses into the air. In a few areas, depending on local geology, radon dissolves into ground water and can be released into the air when the water is used. Radon gas usually exists at very low levels outdoors, but the gas can accumulate in areas without adequate ventilation, such as underground mines. Radon is present in nearly all air, so everyone breathes in radon every day, usually at very low levels. Radon can enter homes through cracks in floors, walls, or foundations, and collect indoors. It can also be released from building materials or from water obtained from wells that contain radon. Radon levels may be higher in homes that are well insulated, tightly sealed, and/or built on soil rich in the elements uranium, thorium, and radium. Basements and first floors typically have the highest radon levels because of their closeness to the ground. Workers employed in uranium, hard rock, and phosphate mining potentially are exposed to radon at high concentrations. Uranium miners generally are believed to have the highest exposures. Radon was identified as a health problem when scientists noted that underground uranium miners who were exposed to it died of lung cancer at high rates. Experimental studies in animals confirmed the results of the miner studies by showing higher rates of lung tumors among rodents exposed to high levels of radon. There has been a suggestion of an increased risk of leukemia associated with radon exposure in adults and children; the evidence, however, is not conclusive. Check the radon levels in your home regularly.

The award duration must be for at least 3 years with a minimum of $150,000 direct costs per year. Grants under a no-cost extension do not qualify.  The T32 faculty/mentors/preceptors are expected to have peer-reviewed independent R01 or R01-like research support. New and Early Stage Investigators with no such funding or training track record may serve as co-mentors.  Budget  A new T32 program may request up to 6 trainee slots.  A competitive renewal T32 applicant may request up to 8 trainee slots in any budget year.  At the time of competitive renewal, T32 applicants may request changes in types of trainee slots (i.e., convert postdoctoral slots to predoctoral slots and vice versa).  T32 applicants requesting $500,000 or more in direct costs for any year are not required to contact NCI staff for permission to submit the application.  Requests to change the T32 PD/PI must be submitted electronically through the eRA Commons Prior Approval Module.  Addition of T32 mentors must meet the requirement of having peer-reviewed independent R01 or R01-like research support (refer to A.3). These changes must be reported in the annual progress report.  Short-term training positions are not allowed for NCI T32 training programs.  New trainees under NCI T32 grants are generally appointed for full-time 12-month continuous periods per budget year. A new trainee appointment with a minimum of 9 months per budget year may be considered with justification and NCI Program Director prior approval.  The Postdoctoral trainees are expected to commit to their research program for at least 2 years to meet payback obligation.  The total number of awarded trainee months for each budget period may not be exceeded, nor may the numbers of predoctoral and/or postdoctoral trainee appointments at any time exceed the numbers specified in the Notice of Award.  Trainee slots are decided based on peer-review outcomes. The redistribution of trainee slots may be considered once during the current project period by the NCI program director. The formal signed request with justification must be submitted by the AOR to the assigned NCI Program Director and Grants Management Specialist.  Tuition and fees are allowable trainee costs only if such charges are applied consistently to all individuals in a similar training status at the organization, without regard to their source of support.
	Tuition at the postdoctoral level is limited to that required for specific courses in support of the approved training program and requires NCI prior approval. See NIH Grant Policy Statement 11.2.8.3.
NCI allows rebudgeting of Tuition and Fees only up to the NRSA standard allowance.  If Postdoctoral tuition and fees are requested, Postdoctoral trainee progress reports must include information about the courses taken.  Carryover of unobligated balances requires NCI staff review and prior approval.  Only the reappointment of current trainees is allowed during a no-cost extension (if stipend months are available).  Tuition at the postdoctoral level is limited to that required for specific courses in support of the approved training program and requires NCI prior approval. See NIH Grant Policy Statement 11.2.8.3.  NCI allows rebudgeting of Tuition and Fees only up to the NRSA standard allowance.  The Statement of Appointment Form (PHS2271) must be submitted for each trainee, each year prior to or at the time of appointment. A Payback Agreement (PHS6031, revised 9/93) must be submitted for all postdoctoral trainees beginning their initial Kirschstein-NRSA appointment. No stipend or other allowances may be paid until the submission of the proper forms. Failure to submit these forms within 90 days of the start date for the appointment may result in an expenditure disallowance or a delay in continued funding.

Past Programs  Funding  Researcher Resources  News & Events  About DCB  Progress   Past Programs  Scott Manalis, Ph.D., a CSBC Investigator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has always been interested in coming up with new types of measurements and ways to push the limits of quantitative approaches. His enthusiasm for using a wide range of analytical skills to solve complex problems led him to study Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara and Stanford University. As a graduate student, he designed state-of-the-art cantilevers for atomic force microscopes. He currently uses his knowledge of applied physics to develop microfluidic devices for systems biology studies. In this interview, he discusses mentors and collaborators who have helped him in his career, as well as systems biology approaches to investigate cancer. Always stick to following the path that you’re most passionate about. My Ph.D. thesis advisor, Cal Quate, who was an inventor of the atomic force microscope, provided me with valuable guidance and a great deal of freedom for exploring and following my passion. For cancer systems biology research, Doug Lauffenburger, Marc Kirschner, and Tyler Jacks have all made important contributions to furthering my career at MIT. I’m incredibly grateful for their mentorship. It is the idea of predicting how a complex system will behave. In my area of single cell analysis, emerging measurements are producing lots of information about the cell, at both the aggregate, biophysical level and the molecular level. I see two big challenges in this field: Understanding how to apply these measurements to the cells that matter most, which may be rare and/or might not have well defined markers.  Turning single-cell data into a clear description of how the system will behave over time and in the presence of various perturbations.  The Suspended Microchannel Resonator (SMR) can measure the mass of a single cell. This technology is 1-2 orders of magnitude more precise for measuring cell size than other methods, such as advanced forms of microscopy. By weighing the same cell multiple times, we can measure cell growth where growth is defined by the rate at which it accumulates biomass. In our CSBC Research Center, we are integrating SMR growth measurements with single-cell RNA sequencing to inform our understanding of resistance mechanisms and guide personalized therapeutic strategies. About a decade ago, we started working with Dr. Marc Kirschner at Harvard Medical School on using the SMR approach to understand how cell growth is related to progression through the cell cycle. We met at a poster session at Harvard Medical School, where my lab presented the SMR device. Up until I met Marc, we would tell biologists that we could weigh a cell with incredible precision. They would respond, “that’s very cool – let us get back to you on what we could do with it.” However, Marc was one of the few who really did get back to us. He realized that the SMR could be used to answer important biological questions about the relationship between cell size and cell cycle activity. This established the foundation for on-going collaborations we’ve had over the past five years with physician scientists at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Ultimately, we aim to address the question, “Can measuring ex vivo growth properties of a patient’s tumor cells help guide cancer treatment for that patient?” However, we have much to learn by first examining model systems, such as cell lines, patient derived xenografts and organoids. It’s exciting and rewarding to work with people that bring expertise to a problem that you don’t have. Combining two different sets of expertise to come up with an experiment neither side would’ve thought of is an incredibly fun process. Treatment for most cancers – particularly at relapse – is often selected empirically. This leads to situations where a patient receives a therapy that doesn’t work for him/her, when other cancer drugs would have been better. If our CSBC program is successful, it will unveil new pathways to therapeutically target and will help us identify optimal treatments for individual cancer patients.

The overarching goal of the NCI RAS Initiative is to mobilize the cancer research community to develop ways to understand and target cancers driven by mutant RAS in an open model of collaboration among government, academic, and industry researchers. This approach is called a "hub and spoke" model. The Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR) acts as the hub that connects to the larger community of RAS researchers around the world combining efforts and creating new ways to approach the complex issue of RAS. It has been known for more than three decades that about a third of all human cancers, including a high percentage of pancreatic, lung, and colorectal cancers, are driven by mutations in RAS genes. The main members of the RAS gene family— KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS—encode proteins that have a pivotal role in cell signaling. When RAS genes are mutated, cells grow uncontrollably and evade death signals. RAS mutations also make cells resistant to most available cancer therapies. NCI launched the RAS Initiative due to the magnitude of this challenge, as well as the potential clinical benefit. RAS Proteins and Their Regulators in Human Disease provides a recent review of the RAS problem. For a community view of the genes that comprise the larger RAS pathway, see our blog post, RAS Pathway v2.0. RAS proteins are important for normal development. Active RAS drives the growth, proliferation, and migration of cells. In normal cells RAS receives signals and obeys those signals to rapidly switch between the active (GTP) form and the inactive (GDP form) states. Mutated RAS* is stuck in the active state, ignores signals to the contrary, and drives cells to become cancerous. Mutant RAS proteins have been difficult to target, in part, because they are defective in an intrinsic enzyme activity, freezing them in the “on” (GTP-bound) state. (See diagram.). It is like a car with an accelerator that won’t release (green down arrow) and brakes that won’t engage (red up arrow). Despite repeated attempts, researchers failed to develop a drug that could inhibit the activity of RAS proteins in cancers. They had hoped to find a small molecule that could preferentially bind the unique features of the RAS protein, but they couldn’t find a surface on the protein that would bind a drug. Many researchers in the drug discovery field became convinced that the RAS protein was undruggable. But advances in technology and improved understanding of RAS signaling and regulation have created opportunities to address this situation. After years with little success, researchers developed groundbreaking techniques that rapidly advanced the field of RAS research. In the 2010s, the Shokat Lab at the University of California San Francisco and the Fesik Lab at Vanderbilt University developed innovative drug screening and medicinal chemistry techniques that identified molecules that could bind mutated KRAS proteins. In May 2021, the Federal Drug Administration approved a treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which targets the KRAS G12C mutation, giving new hope to NSCLC patients. The RAS research community has much to discover, and now it continues its work with renewed optimism. After developing an approved treatment for NSCLC, many researchers seek to apply what they’ve learned to other tumors. For example, mutated RAS proteins are present in 90% of pancreatic tumors, a cancer for which there are not yet any effective treatments. Clearly, the need for additional treatments targeting mutated RAS proteins in more types of cancers remains strong convincing. The RAS Initiative has adopted the “hub and spoke” model to mobilize the RAS research community. Based out of the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR), the RAS Initiative acts as the hub that connects the larger community of RAS researchers located around the world. This open model allows government, academic, and industry researchers around the world to collaborate and more effectively advance the field of RAS research. The RAS Initiative was launched in 2013 to continue to spur innovation in the field through drug discovery and detailed studies on the structure, biochemistry, and biophysics of RAS. The overarching model of the RAS Initiative is to nucleate more energy and focus on RAS biology and drug discovery through state-of-the-art science, and by providing resources, de-risking some of that effort by providing structures, assays, and reagents, and by coalescing the community. Accomplishments of the RAS Initiative include key structural, biochemical, biophysical, technological advances and, drug discovery. Here are some major accomplishments: The "Hub and Spoke" Model: the FNLCR serves as the research hub that connect research collaborators nationally and internationally. The RAS Initiative was the first research team to produce, purify, and generate a crystal structure of fully processed KRAS4b. This advancement enabled biophysical analyses of KRAS in synthetic membranes and showed how processing is critical in complexes interacting with chaperone proteins [citation link].  The RAS Initiative solved additional crystal structures of oncogenic KRAS proteins in complex with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) [citation link].  The RAS Initiative Research Team developed a range of cell-based, imaging, and biochemical screens to examine RAS activity, which have facilitated academic and industry collaborations [citation link].  The RAS Initiative formed a, strategic, high-performance computing alliance with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratories to bring new insight into RAS membrane dynamics [citation link].  The RAS Initiative Research Team have active inhibitor programs that are progressing toward the clinic.  In 2016, Deputy NCI Director Dr. Lowy discussed the progress of the RAS Initiative and its goal to create a virtual network of scientists collaborating to solve the RAS problem.  Updated:

Childhood Mesothelioma Treatment  Health Professional   Malignant Mesothelioma Treatment  Childhood Mesothelioma Treatment   General Information About Childhood Mesothelioma  Stages of Childhood Mesothelioma  Treatment Option Overview  Treatment of Childhood Mesothelioma  Treatment of Recurrent Childhood Mesothelioma  To Learn More About Childhood Mesothelioma  About This PDQ Summary  Mesothelioma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in
		  the thin layer of tissue that covers organs in the chest or abdomen. Treatment with radiation therapy increases the risk of childhood mesothelioma. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma include trouble breathing and pain in the chest or abdomen. Tests that examine the chest, abdomen, and heart are used to diagnose mesothelioma. Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery). Malignant mesothelioma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells are found in one or more of the following: Pleura: A thin layer of tissue that lines the chest cavity and covers the lungs. Peritoneum: A thin layer of tissue that lines the abdomen and covers most of the organs in the abdomen. Pericardium: A thin layer of tissue that surrounds the heart. The tumors often spread over the surface of organs without spreading into the organ. They may spread to nearby lymph nodes or in other parts of the body. Malignant mesothelioma may also form in the testicles, but this is rare. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk. Treatment for an earlier cancer, especially radiation therapy, increases the risk of mesothelioma in children. In adults, mesothelioma is strongly linked to being exposed to asbestos, which has been used in the building and textile industries. In children, there is little information about the risk of developing mesothelioma after being exposed to asbestos. In children, these and other signs and symptoms may be caused by mesothelioma  or by other conditions. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following: Trouble breathing. Cough for no known reason. Pain under the rib cage or pain in the chest and abdomen. Weight loss for no known reason. Feeling very tired. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and health history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.EnlargePositron emission tomography (PET) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the PET scanner. The head rest and white strap help the child lie still.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the child's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body.  Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Pulmonary function test (PFT): A test to see how well the lungs are working. It measures how much air the lungs can hold and how quickly air moves into and out of the lungs. It also measures how much oxygen is used and how much carbon dioxide is given off during breathing. This is also called a lung function test. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy:  The removal of  tissue or fluid using a thin needle.  A pathologist views the tissue or fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells. Thoracoscopy: A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the chest to check for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made between two ribs and a thoracoscope  is inserted into the chest.  A thoracoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.  In some cases, this procedure is used to remove part of the esophagus or lung. Bronchoscopy: A procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas. A bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. Laparoscopy: A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for abnormal areas. Small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope (thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. Other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to perform procedures such as removing organs or taking tissue samples to be checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. Cytologic exam: An exam of cells under a microscope (by a pathologist) to check for anything abnormal. For mesothelioma, fluid is taken from around the lungs or from the abdomen. A pathologist checks the cells in the fluid. Prognosis depends on whether the cancer: has spread throughout the thin layer of tissue or into organs. has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back). The process used to find out if cancer has spread from where it first began is called staging. In childhood mesothelioma, cancer may spread to nearby or distant lymph nodes. There is no standard staging system for childhood mesothelioma. The results of tests and procedures done to diagnose mesothelioma are used to help make decisions about treatment. Sometimes childhood mesothelioma recurs (comes back) after it has been treated. There are different types of treatment for children with mesothelioma. Children with mesothelioma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer. Three types of treatment are used:SurgeryChemotherapyRadiation therapy New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.Targeted therapyImmunotherapy Treatment for childhood mesothelioma may cause side effects. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Follow-up tests may be needed. Surgery Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Targeted therapy Immunotherapy Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.  A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment. Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health professionals who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. This may include the following specialists and others: Pediatrician. Pediatric surgeon. Radiation oncologist. Pathologist. Pediatric nurse specialist. Social worker. Rehabilitation specialist. Psychologist. Child-life specialist. Surgery to remove the tumor may be used to treat childhood mesothelioma. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of childhood mesothelioma that has recurred (come back). Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of biologic therapy. To learn more about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, visit Side Effects. Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include: Physical problems. Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory. Second cancers (new types of cancer) or other conditions. Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or checkups. Some tests that were done to diagnose or stage the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section. Treatment of newly diagnosed mesothelioma in children may include the following: Surgery to remove the part of the chest lining with cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it. Chemotherapy. Radiation therapy, as palliative therapy, to relieve pain and improve quality of life. Clinical trials of newer drugs and immunotherapy.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish. PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood mesothelioma.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board. A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

Research Articles   Research Articles  The Adjuvant Lung Cancer Enrichment Marker Identification and Sequencing Trials, or ALCHEMIST, is a group of randomized clinical trials for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have been completely removed by surgery. Even with surgery and standard adjuvant (post-surgical) treatment, cancer will come back in about half of people with early-stage NSCLC. The ALCHEMIST trials were launched to test whether adding targeted therapy based on the genetics of a person’s tumor will help prevent the cancer from returning. ALCHEMIST includes a screening trial to identify potential participants who have changes in either of two genes, EGFR and ALK, that frequently drive cancer growth in people with NSCLC. Mutations in the EGFR gene are found in about 10% to 15% of non-Asian NSCLC patients and up to 50% of Asian patients. A rearrangement of the ALK gene affects another 5% to 6% of NSCLC patients. Potential participants found to have EGFR alterations or the ALK rearrangement in their tumors could be assigned to trials to test drugs targeting these changes. The drugs being tested, erlotinib (Tarceva) for patients with EGFR mutations and crizotinib (Xalkori) for those with the ALK rearrangement, have already been approved for patients with advanced lung cancer that has these genetic changes. Potential participants without EGFR or ALK changes in their tumors could be assigned to trials to test immunotherapy drugs. The drugs being tested, nivolumab (Opdivo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda), are both a type of immunotherapy called immune checkpoint inhibitors. Two ALCHEMIST trials, one testing erlotinib in people with EGFR mutations and the other testing nivolumab immunotherapy in those without EGFR or ALK changes, are closed to enrollment and awaiting results. The trials of crizotinib for patients with ALK-rearranged tumors and pembrolizumab immunotherapy are still open to new patients. Patients who participate in the ALCHEMIST Screening Trial have their tumors tested to see if they have EGFR gene mutations or the ALK gene rearrangement. Approximately 8,000 patients will have their tumor tissue tested in the ALCHEMIST screening trial. All patients screened for ALCHEMIST will be monitored for 5 years. See the ALCHEMIST screening trial patient handout for more information. People whose tumors are found to have the ALK rearrangement, known as an ALK-EML4 fusion, are eligible to join the ALCHEMIST ALK treatment trial. Participants in this trial are randomly assigned to receive crizotinib until they experience unacceptable toxicity or disease recurrence or to be observed and followed by their doctor at check-ups every 6 months. Participants’ health will be monitored for up to 10 years. See the ALCHEMIST ALK trial patient handout for more information. Because earlier studies had found that the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy improves survival in people with advanced NSCLC without alterations in EGFR or ALK, ALCHEMIST researchers wanted to test immunotherapy for patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for early-stage NSCLC. So a second ALCHEMIST immunotherapy trial is comparing pembrolizumab, given either during or after chemotherapy, with chemotherapy alone for people whose early-stage NSCLC lacks EGFR mutations or the ALK rearrangement. People assigned to receive pembrolizumab and chemotherapy together will continue receiving pembrolizumab following completion of chemotherapy. After treatment, participants’ health will be monitored for up to 10 years. People whose tumors had an EGFR mutation were referred to the ALCHEMIST EGFR treatment trial, to receive either erlotinib or a matching placebo pill for up to 2 years. This trial has completed enrollment. The ALCHEMIST nivolumab immunotherapy trial was created for patients with early-stage NSCLC whose tumors do not contain the ALK or EGFR gene changes. Patients were randomly assigned to receive the drug nivolumab or be observed. After treatment, participants’ health is being monitored for up to 10 years. This trial has completed enrollment. The ALCHEMIST studies are being coordinated by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology and the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, both members of the NCI-sponsored National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN).

Glial cells support and protect the brain's nerve cells (also called neurons). They hold nerve cells in place, bring food and oxygen to nerve cells, and help protect nerve cells from disease, such as infection. Gliomas can form in any area of the CNS and can be low grade or high grade. Other types of tumors can form in glial cells and nerve cells. Neuronal tumors are rare tumors made up of nerve cells. Glioneuronal tumors are a mix of nerve cells and glial cells. Neuronal and glioneuronal tumors are rare, low-grade tumors and are treated the same as gliomas. Although cancer is rare in children, brain tumors are the second most common type of childhood cancer, after leukemia. Gliomas are most common in these parts of the CNS: Cerebrum, the largest part of the brain, at the top of the head. The cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem-solving, speech, emotions, reading, writing, and voluntary movement. Cerebellum, the lower, back part of the brain (near the middle of the back of the head). The cerebellum controls voluntary movement, balance, and posture. Brain stem, the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord. The brain stem is in the lowest part of the brain (just above the back of the neck). It controls breathing, heart rate, and the nerves and muscles used in seeing, hearing, walking, talking, and eating. Hypothalamus, the area in the middle of the base of the brain. It controls body
		  temperature, hunger, and thirst. Visual pathway, the group of nerves that connect the eye with the brain. Spinal cord, the column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back. It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes. The spinal cord and membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae (back bones). Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body, such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain  to feel  touch.

It starts in a type of star-shaped glial cell called an astrocyte. Astrocytomas can form anywhere in the central nervous system. Optic pathway glioma is a type of low-grade (slow-growing) glioma that can grow in children with a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). There are many types of astrocytomas, other gliomas, neuronal tumors, and glioneuronal tumors including: diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma infant-type hemispheric glioma diffuse low-grade glioma diffuse astrocytoma pilocytic astrocytoma high-grade astrocytoma with piloid features pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma subependymal giant cell astrocytoma ganglioglioma desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma/desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of high-grade glioma that forms in the brain stem and most often occurs in children. To learn more, see Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. Ependymoma is another type of tumor that can form from glial cells, but these tumors are not treated the same as gliomas. To learn more, see Childhood Ependymoma. Gliomas are caused by certain changes to the way glial cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. Often, the exact cause of cell changes that lead to glioma is unknown. To learn more about how cancer develops, see What Is Cancer? A risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Not every child with a risk factor will develop a glioma, and it will develop in some children who don't have a known risk factor. Inherited genetic disorders that may be risk factors for glioma include: neurofibromatosis type 1 tuberous sclerosis Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk of a glioma. The symptoms of childhood gliomas depend on the following factors: where the tumor forms in the brain or spinal cord the size of the tumor how fast the tumor grows your child's age and development Some tumors do not cause symptoms while other tumors cause symptoms based on their location in the central nervous system. It's important to check with your child's doctor if your child has any symptoms below: morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting nausea and vomiting vision, hearing, and speech problems loss of balance and trouble walking worsening handwriting or slow speech weakness or change in feeling on one side of the body unusual sleepiness more or less energy than usual change in personality or behavior seizures weight loss or weight gain for no known reason increase in the size of the head (in infants) These symptoms may be caused by conditions other than childhood gliomas. The only way to know is to see your child's doctor. If your child has symptoms that suggest a central nervous system tumor such as glioma, the doctor will need to find out if they are due to cancer or another condition. The doctor will ask you when the symptoms started and how often your child has been having them. They will also ask about your child's personal and family medical history and do a physical exam, including a neurologic exam. Depending on these results, they may recommend tests to find out if your child has a central nervous system tumor. The following tests may be used to diagnose a glioma, neuronal tumor, or glioneuronal tumor. The results will also help you and your child's doctor plan treatment. MRI uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord. Sometimes a substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may be done during the same MRI scan to look at the chemical makeup of the brain tissue. Immunohistochemistry is a laboratory test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of a patient's tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an enzyme or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer. An MIB-1 test is a type of immunohistochemistry that checks tumor tissue for an antigen called MIB-1. This may show how fast a tumor is growing. A molecular test checks for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules in a sample of tissue, blood, or bone marrow. Molecular tests also check for certain changes in a gene or chromosome that may cause or affect the chance of developing a brain tumor. A molecular test may be used to help plan treatment, find out how well treatment is working, or make a prognosis. The Molecular Characterization Initiative offers free molecular testing to children, adolescents, and young adults with certain types of newly diagnosed cancer. The program is offered through NCI's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative. To learn more, visit About the Molecular Characterization Initiative. Your child might have surgery to diagnose or to remove all or part of the glioma. During the surgery, the surgeon removes a part of the skull, which gives an opening to remove the tumor. Sometimes scans are done during the procedure to help the surgeon locate the tumor and remove it. A pathologist will study the tumor under a microscope. If cancer cells are found, the surgeon may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery. The piece of skull is usually put back in place after the procedure. Sometimes tumors form in a place that makes them hard to remove. If removing the tumor may cause severe physical, emotional, or learning problems, a biopsy is done and more treatment is given after the biopsy. Children who have a rare genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 may be at risk of a low-grade glioma called optic pathway glioma that forms in the area of the brain that controls vision. These children may not need a biopsy to diagnose the tumor. Surgery to remove the tumor may not be needed if the tumor does not grow and symptoms do not occur. You may want to get a second opinion to confirm your child's diagnosis and treatment plan. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans. They may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another approach, or provide more information about your child's cancer. To learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see Finding Health Care Services. You can contact NCI's Cancer Information Service via chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor or hospital that can provide a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, see Questions to Ask Your Doctor about Cancer. Staging is the process of learning the extent of cancer in the body and is often used to help plan treatment and make a prognosis. There is no staging system used for childhood glioma, but it is given a tumor grade. Tumor grading is based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Tumor grade describes how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope, how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread within the central nervous system, and how likely the tumor is to come back after treatment. There are four grades of gliomas, but they are most often grouped into low grade (grades I or II) or high grade (grades III or IV): Low-grade gliomas grow slowly and do not spread within the brain and spinal cord. But as they grow, they press on nearby healthy areas of the brain, affecting brain function. Most low-grade gliomas are treatable. High-grade gliomas are fast growing and often spread within the brain and spinal cord, which makes them harder to treat. Childhood gliomas usually do not spread to other parts of the body. When a glioma comes back after it has been treated it is called a recurrent glioma. A glioma may come back in the same place as the first tumor or in other areas of the brain or spinal cord. Tests will be done to help determine if and where the cancer has returned. The type of treatment that your child will have for recurrent glioma will depend on where it came back. Sometimes a low-grade glioma can come back as a high-grade glioma. High-grade gliomas often come back within 3 years either in the place where the cancer first formed or somewhere else in the brain or spinal cord. Progressive childhood glioma is cancer that continues to grow, spread, or get worse. Progressive disease can be a sign that the cancer no longer responds to treatment. There are different types of treatment for children and adolescents with glioma. You and your child's cancer care team will work together to decide treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as your child's overall health, the tumor grade, and whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has come back. A pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer, will oversee treatment. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. Other specialists may include: pediatrician pediatric neurosurgeon neurologist neuropathologist neuroradiologist rehabilitation specialist radiation oncologist endocrinologist psychologist social worker child-life specialist fertility specialist Your child's treatment plan will include information about the cancer, the goals of treatment, treatment options, and the possible side effects. It will be helpful to talk with your child's cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect. For help every step of the way, see our downloadable booklet, Children with Cancer: A Guide for Parents. Surgery is used to diagnose and treat childhood  gliomas, as discussed in the Tests to diagnose childhood glioma  (including astrocytoma) section of this summary. After surgery, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is done to see if any cancer cells remain. If cancer cells are found, further treatment depends on: where the remaining cancer cells are the grade of the tumor your child's age After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some children may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Sometimes children with a glioma have increased fluid around the brain or spinal cord. They may need surgery to place a shunt (long, thin tube) in a ventricle (fluid-filled space) of the brain and thread it under the skin to another part of the body, usually the abdomen. The shunt carries extra fluid away from the brain so it may be absorbed elsewhere in the body. This decreases the fluid and pressure on the brain or spinal cord. This process is called a CSF shunt. Observation is closely monitoring a person's condition without giving any treatment or additional treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Observation may be used: if your child has no symptoms, such as children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) if your child's tumor is small and is found when a different health problem is being diagnosed or treated after the tumor is removed by surgery until signs or symptoms appear or change Chemotherapy (also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   Chemotherapy may be given alone or with other types of treatment, such as radiation therapy. To treat a glioma, chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein. When given this way, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body.  Chemotherapy that may be used includes: carboplatin lomustine procarbazine temozolomide thioguanine vinblastine vincristine Combinations of these drugs may be used. Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used. Learn more about Chemotherapy to Treat Cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. Glioma may be treated with external beam radiation therapy. This type of treatment uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Radiation therapy may be given alone or with other treatments, such as chemotherapy. Certain ways of giving external beam radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include: Conformal radiation therapy  uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses a computer to make 3-D pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. Stereotactic radiation therapy uses a machine that aims radiation directly at the tumor causing less damage to nearby healthy tissue. The total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days. A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment.  This procedure is also called stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotaxic radiation therapy. Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells. This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy tissue near a tumor. The way radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor and where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord. Radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development, especially in young children. For children younger than 3 years, chemotherapy may be given instead, to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy. Radiation therapy may also be delayed for patients with NF1 because they may be at increased risk for a second cancer. To learn more, see External Beam Radiation Therapy for Cancer and Radiation Therapy Side Effects. Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances to block the action of specific enzymes, proteins, or other molecules involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. Targeted therapies that may be used or are being studied to treat glioma include: bevacizumab dabrafenib everolimus larotrectinib selumetinib sirolimus trametinib Learn more about Targeted Therapy to Treat Cancer. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for people with cancer. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Use our clinical trials search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. To learn more, see Clinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers. Immunotherapy helps a person's immune system fight cancer. The following treatments are being studied to treat glioma: oncolytic virus therapy chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy drugs that block the activity of PD-1 Learn more about how immunotherapy works against cancer, how it is given, and possible side effects, and more in Immunotherapy to Treat Cancer. Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and a central nervous system tumor, children with an optic pathway glioma, or children who had a tumor found when getting a scan for another health problem may be observed (closely watched). These children may not receive treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change or the tumor grows. Children with tuberous sclerosis may develop low-grade tumors in the brain called  subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGAs). Targeted therapy with everolimus or sirolimus may be used instead of surgery, to shrink the tumors. Children diagnosed with low-grade glioma are treated based on where the tumor is located. The first treatment is usually surgery. An MRI is done after surgery to see if any tumor remains. If the tumor was completely removed by surgery, more treatment may not be needed and the child is closely observed. If there is tumor remaining after surgery, treatment may include: observation for children who had surgery to remove part of the tumor and the tumor is expected to regrow slowly combination chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy radiation therapy, which may include conformal radiation therapy,  intensity-modulated radiation therapy, proton beam radiation therapy, or stereotactic radiation therapy, may be used if the tumor does not respond to chemotherapy or when the tumor begins to grow again a clinical trial of targeted therapy (selumetinib) with or without chemotherapy To learn more about these treatments, see Types of treatment for childhood glioma (including astrocytoma). Childhood glioma, astrocytoma, glioneuronal, and neuronal tumors can be progressive or recurrent. They most often come back in the same area but can spread to other areas in the brain.  Before more cancer treatment is given, imaging tests, biopsy, or surgery are done to find out if there is cancer, how much there is, and the grade. Treatment of progressive or recurrent childhood low-grade glioma, astrocytoma, glioneuronal, and neuronal tumors may include: a second surgery to remove the tumor radiation therapy (including conformal radiation therapy), if radiation therapy was not used when the tumor was first diagnosed chemotherapy, if the tumor progressed or recurred where it cannot be removed by surgery targeted therapy (bevacizumab) with or without chemotherapy targeted therapy (everolimus or sirolimus) targeted therapy (dabrafenib and trametinib) a clinical trial of targeted therapy (selumetinib) To learn more about these treatments, see Types of treatment for childhood glioma (including astrocytoma). Treatment of  newly diagnosed childhood  high-grade glioma may include: surgery to remove the tumor radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy targeted therapy a clinical trial of targeted therapy with a combination of dabrafenib  and trametinib after radiation therapy to treat newly diagnosed high-grade glioma that has mutations in the BRAF gene a clinical trial of immunotherapy To learn more about these treatments, see Types of treatment for childhood glioma (including astrocytoma). Treatment of  recurrent childhood high-grade glioma may include: second surgery depending on tumor type, location, and length of time between treatment and recurrence radiation therapy a clinical trial of targeted therapy a clinical trial of immunotherapy To learn more about these treatments, see Types of treatment for childhood glioma (including astrocytoma). If your child has been diagnosed with a glioma, you likely have questions about how serious the cancer is and your child's chances of survival. The likely outcome or course of a disease is called prognosis. The prognosis depends on many factors, including: whether the tumor is a low-grade or high-grade glioma where the tumor has formed in the central nervous system and if it has spread within the central nervous system or to other parts of the body how fast the tumor is growing your child's age whether cancer cells remain after surgery whether there are changes in certain genes such as BRAF whether your child has NF1 or tuberous sclerosis whether your child has diencephalic syndrome, a condition which slows physical growth whether the glioma has just been diagnosed or has come back after treatment Children with a low-grade glioma, astrocytoma, neuronal tumor, or glioneuronal tumor have a relatively favorable prognosis if the tumor can be removed by surgery. Children with a high-grade glioma have a poor prognosis. Some children diagnosed with a high-grade glioma, particularly infants younger than 1 year, may have tumors with certain fusion genes. Infants with a high-grade glioma whose tumors show these genetic changes may have a better prognosis than older children with a high-grade glioma. For glioma that has come back after treatment, prognosis and treatment depend on how much time passed between the time treatment ended and the time the glioma came back. No two people are alike, and responses to treatment can vary greatly. Your child's cancer care team is in the best position to talk with you about your child's prognosis. The signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis and continue for months or years. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment. To learn more about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, visit Side Effects. Problems from cancer treatment that begin 6 months or later after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include: physical problems that affect:vision, including blindnessblood vesselshormone levels changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory second cancers (new types of cancer) vision, including blindness blood vessels hormone levels Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. To learn more, see Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or checkups. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Regular MRIs will continue to be done after treatment has ended. The results of the MRI can show if your child's condition has changed or if the glioma has come back. If the results of the MRI show a mass in the brain, a biopsy may be done to find out if it is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing. Children who received radiation therapy to treat an optic pathway glioma are at risk of developing vision changes. These changes are most likely to occur within 2 years after radiation therapy. The effect of tumor growth and treatment on the child's vision will be closely followed during and after treatment. When your child has cancer, every member of the family needs support. Taking care of yourself during this time is important. Reach out to your child's treatment team and to people in your family and community for support.

Research Articles   Research Articles  1. Why was this study needed? Previous studies found that computerized tomographic colonography (CTC), also known as virtual colonoscopy, held promise as a screening method for colorectal cancer thanks to its accuracy, safety, cost-effectiveness, and patient acceptability. Given the fact that early detection of colorectal cancer has been shown to reduce mortality and that there are limitations to other colorectal screening approaches, there was a strong need to investigate whether CTC could be used as a screening tool. Many consumer and public health organizations recommend that adults age 50 and older receive either colonoscopy every 10 years or some other form of colorectal screening, such as fecal occult blood testing or sigmoidoscopy. However, a large percentage (40-60 percent) of the over age 50 population in the United States remains inadequately screened. Additional screening options could translate into higher screening rates, earlier detection of cancer and polyps that potentially might develop into cancer, and ultimately fewer colorectal deaths. Extensive preliminary CTC research has already been conducted and published. This study was designed to clinically validate CTC for detecting colorectal polyps 10 mm or larger in a multicenter trial. Although similar single-center trials are ongoing or recently published, validation of the technique at several centers by multiple radiologists is critical for establishing CTC's accuracy in comparison to colonoscopy. Researchers sought to generate data that would provide a balanced evaluation of the value and practicality of this screening tool. 2. What procedures were the study participants asked to follow? Participants enrolled in the study were scheduled for a screening colonoscopy and agreed to also have a CTC exam on the same day as their colonoscopy (99 percent of enrollees underwent same day examination). The day before the exams, participants underwent one of three different colon-cleansing procedures depending upon the standard prescribed by their gastroenterology physician. This procedure was required for both the CTC and colonoscopy exams. The participants also were instructed to drink a solution that helps to distinguish any remaining stool from a polyp or cancer on the CTC images. On the day of the exams, participants first had the CTC scan. During the exam, a small enema tip was placed in the rectum and carbon dioxide gas slowly inflated the colon until the patient felt full and the colon was adequately inflated. The inflated colon provides a better view of polyps or other abnormalities on the CT images. A set of CT images was produced with the participants lying on their back and stomach--holding their breath for a brief moment in each position. No sedation was required but a muscle relaxer called glucagon was administered to help prevent colorectal spasms, unless it was not advisable due to medical reasons or the participant refused it. The images were then sent to a computer for review by a radiologist. Following the CTC exam, the colonoscopy was performed according to the standard procedures at each participating site. The colonoscopy was performed without the physician having any knowledge of the CTC results. The CTC and colonoscopy reports were then compared after both procedures were completed. Participants were advised to have a repeat colonoscopy within 90 days if a polyp 10 mm or larger was detected on the CTC exam and not identified during conventional colonoscopy. Two weeks after their exams, participants were sent a questionnaire about their screening experience. 3. Who was eligible to participate in the trial? Both men and women age 50 years or older who were scheduled for screening colonoscopy and did not have symptoms of colorectal disease were eligible to participate in the trial. The researchers excluded individuals with serious medical conditions that would increase the risk associated with colonoscopy and people who had had colonoscopies within the past five years. Over 2,600 participants were enrolled in the study at 15 institutions across the U.S. 4. What was the primary scientific goal of the study? Researchers sought to evaluate how well CTC identifies participants with at least one significantly large polyp (those 10 mm in diameter or more) using colonoscopy as the gold (or reference) standard. 5. What did the study find about CTC as a cancer screening tool? This large, multicenter trial demonstrated that CTC is highly accurate for the detection of intermediate and large polyps. Using conventional colonoscopy as the gold standard, the study reported that CTC detected polyps 10 mm or larger in 90 percent of all participants who were confirmed to have a polyp of this size by colonoscopy. 6. Why are polyps the size of 10 mm or larger especially important to detect? Generally, polyps of this size are more likely to develop into cancer. However, smaller polyps can also become cancerous, and this study demonstrated that CTC is able to detect polyps as small as 5 mm in width (about the diameter of a pencil) with high sensitivity. Sensitivity in this study was defined as the percentage of polyps detected by CTC that were later confirmed by biopsy as actually being polyps that have the potential to become cancerous. In particular, the study estimated the following sensitivity values, depending on polyp size: 90 percent for polyps 9 mm in size or greater  87 percent for polyps 8mm in size or greater  84 percent for polyps 7mm in size or greater  78 percent for polyps 6mm in size or greater  7. How many people screened with CTC are expected to be referred for a subsequent colonoscopy? The study results indicate that if all patients found to have a polyp 5 mm or larger by CTC were referred for a colonoscopy, less than 17 percent of patients would be required to undergo the additional exam. For those who will require a follow-up colonoscopy, the researchers recommend that referring physicians, endoscopists, and radiologists work together to provide same-day examinations to eliminate the need for a second colon cleansing. 8. What types of CT scanners were used in this study? Study sites were required to use a 16-slice (or higher) CT scanner that can obtain 16 images per x-ray tube rotation. These types of CT scanners can acquire thinner slices for better image quality and can do a complete colorectal scan in a matter of minutes. Scanners used in this study include those manufactured by: General Electric (Milwaukee, Wis.)  Siemens (Munich, Germany)  Philips (Best, Noord-Brabant, Netherlands)  Toshiba (Tochigi, Japan)  9. How much radiation is a person exposed to during a CTC exam? The amount of radiation exposure during a single CTC exam is very small and is reported to be 50 percent less than a standard CT scan of the abdomen or pelvis. As medical imaging exams have replaced more invasive and often more costly procedures, concerns have been raised that the cumulative radiation exposure from repeat exams could, over time, have adverse effects, particularly for at-risk populations. Multiple factors should be taken into account when considering the radiation risk from CT scans -- the age of the patient, the number of scans the person has had in any given year and their lifetime, and the benefit to the patient. These factors will assist the health care provider in determining the risks and the benefits of a scan. If a scan is medically indicated, the benefit in practically all cases outweighs the small risk of potential harm. However, this risk should be considered in the decision-making process of both the patient and their physician. 10. Is it likely that these study results could be repeated? Yes, it is likely that the study results can be widely reproduced in community settings if the study procedures are duplicated. A radiologist's competence to perform and interpret CTC exams is dependent upon adequate CTC training, which includes the review of example exams and familiarity with the appropriate software. The radiologists participating in this study were required to pass a certifying examination on the interpretation of CTC images. The study researchers suggest radiologic and other professional organizations work together to offer continuing education for radiologists to gain the competence to perform and accurately interpret CTC examinations. Also, establishment and certification of quality and competency standards would help ensure that the training is translated to the clinical environment. 11. Who conducted the study? This study was conducted by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN), a cooperative cancer research group supported and funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The trial principal investigator was C. Daniel Johnson, M.D., from the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz. Statistical and study methods were overseen by Mei-Hsiu Chen, Ph.D., a statistician within the ACRIN Biostatistics Center at Brown University's Center for Statistical Sciences in Providence, R.I. The radiologists at each of the 15 participating sites served as the site principal investigator and had to have either interpreted 500 CTC exams or participated in a specialized CTC training session. In addition, all radiologists were required to pass a pre-study qualifying examination. 12. Where were the 15 study sites located? Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Mass.  Clinical Radiologists, S.C., Memorial Medical Center, Springfield, Ill.  Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md.  Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, St. Louis, Mo.  Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Ariz.

Yale University, Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, Conn  13. Will researchers investigate other topics about CTC from the information collected as part this study? Yes, when designing the trial, researchers identified several other important topics about CTC to be explored using the study data. These topics include: The effect of the differing colon preparations methods that were standard at each of the 15 participating sites  The willingness of individuals to undergo a repeat CTC as compared to a colonoscopy  The ability of CTC to detect hard-to-find flat lesions in the colon  Differences in the computer software the radiologists used to interpret the exams and their preferences  The cost effectiveness of CTC relative to other colorectal screening tests  What other parts of the body were examined during the CT scans and what was the potential to find other cancers outside the colorectum using this procedure  The researchers are analyzing and documenting information on these topics, which will be reported at future scientific meetings and in medical journals.

Pasche, M.D., Ph.D., FACP, Director Detroit,       Michigan Appointments: 1-800-527-6266 (1-800-KARMANOS) Visit Website The Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) is a not-for-profit, NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in metropolitan Detroit.  The original designation as an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center was obtained under the name “Meyer L. Prentis Comprehensive Cancer Center of Metropolitan Detroit” in 1978.  The institute was founded in 1943 under the name Detroit Institute for Cancer Research.  KCI was formed in 1995 through a strategic partnership of the Meyer L. Prentis Comprehensive Cancer Center of Metropolitan Detroit, the Wayne State University Cancer Institute, the Michigan Cancer Foundation (MCF), and the clinical cancer programs of the Detroit Medical Center.  KCI was named after Barbara Ann Karmanos, the late wife of Peter Karmanos, Jr., a local philanthropist. The Karmanos Cancer Institute is a unique, urban-based integrated center of research, patient care and education, dedicated to the prevention, early detection, treatment and eventual eradication of cancer. Key to achieving this mission is KCI’s research effort, which is conducted among four interdisciplinary programs, organized to integrate basic, translational, clinical, and population research activities.
The Tumor Biology and Microenvironment Program aims to eradicate cancer by identifying the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive interactions between tumors and their microenvironment, and develop and test innovative diagnostic and treatment strategies. The goals of the Molecular Imaging Program include the development and testing of new imaging methods ranging from preclinical work on the synthesis of new probes and development of new devices to the clinical evaluation of imaging approaches to assess cancer risk, detect cancer, guide treatment and monitor therapy. The Molecular Therapeutics Program focuses on developing new approaches for treating cancer, ranging from drug discovery to mechanism-based efforts emphasizing mechanisms-of-action of novel tumor-targeted and standard agents and critical signaling pathways. The Population Studies and Disparities Research Program aims to advance the understanding of the determinants of cancer in metropolitan Detroit’s diverse population in an effort to decrease racial and ethnic disparities.  The goals of this Program include identifying risk factors underlying disease onset and progression, and developing and testing intervention strategies to reduce risk and improve diagnosis, treatment and outcomes.  KCIs Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System was a founding participant in the NCI’s national Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program.  This system facilitates investigations into race-related disparities in cancer incidence and survival. Studies are underway to identify environmental, genetic, and social/cultural determinants of health disparities. A primary objective of KCI is to integrate its scientific research and clinical programs with community outreach activities to local populations in metropolitan Detroit and throughout Michigan.  Research is conducted through more than 450 protocols at the Center, including approximately 330 clinical investigations and a Phase I trial program. * This profile was provided by the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute.

are often associated with situational stress, illness, aging, and drug
treatment.[2]   It is estimated that one-third to one-half of people with cancer experience sleep
disturbances.[3,4]  Physical illness, pain, hospitalization, drugs and other
treatments for cancer, and the psychological impact of a malignant disease may
disrupt the sleeping patterns of people with cancer.[5] Adequate sleep may increase the cancer
patient's pain tolerance. Poor sleep adversely
affects daytime mood and performance.  In the general population, persistent
insomnia has been associated with a higher risk of developing clinical anxiety
or depression.[6] Sleep disturbances and, ultimately, sleep-wake cycle reversals
can be early signs of a developing delirium. Sleep consists of two phases:[7] Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep: REM sleep, also known as dream sleep, is the active or paradoxic
phase of sleep in which the brain is active. Non-REM (NREM)
sleep: NREM sleep is the quiet or restful
phase of sleep.  NREM, also referred to as slow-wave sleep, is divided into four 
stages of progressively deepening sleep based on electroencephalogram
findings. The stages of sleep occur in a repeated pattern or cycle of NREM followed by
REM, with each cycle lasting approximately 90 minutes.  The sleep cycle is
repeated four to six times during a 7- to 8-hour sleep period.[7]  The sleep-wake
cycle is dictated by an inherent biological clock or circadian rhythm. 
Disruptions in individual sleep patterns can disrupt the circadian rhythm and
impair the sleep cycle.[8] The Sleep
Disorders Classification Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine has identified five major categories of sleep disorders:[9] Disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep (insomnias). Sleep-related breathing disorders (sleep apnea). Disorders of excessive somnolence (hypersomnias). Disorders of the sleep-wake cycle (circadian rhythm sleep disorders). Dysfunctions associated with sleep, sleep stages, or partial arousals (parasomnias). In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed.  The evidence and application to practice related to children may differ significantly from information related to adults.  When specific information about the care of children is available, it is summarized under its own heading.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2005. Cancer patients are at great risk of developing insomnia and disorders of the
sleep-wake cycle.  Insomnia, the most common sleep disturbance in this
population, is most often secondary to physical and/or psychological factors
related to cancer and/or cancer treatment.[1-6] Anxiety and depression—common
psychological responses to the diagnosis of cancer, cancer treatment, and
hospitalization—are highly correlated with insomnia.[7,8];[9][Level of evidence: II] Sleep disturbances may be exacerbated by paraneoplastic syndromes associated
with steroid production and by symptoms associated with tumor invasion, such as: Draining lesions. Gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) alterations. Pain. Fever. Cough. Dyspnea. Pruritus. Fatigue. Sleep disturbance can also vary by diagnosis. In a study of patients with melanoma (n = 124), breast cancer (n = 124), and endometrial cancer (n = 82),[10][Level of evidence: II] symptom profiles differed by diagnosis. Four symptom profiles were identified: minimally symptomatic, insomnia-predominant, very sleepy with upper airway symptoms, and symptomatic with severe dysfunction. Using latent class profile analysis, group differences by cancer diagnosis were identified, as shown in Table 1: Differences by disease groups may be associated with treatment regimens and/or other factors. Medications—including
vitamins, corticosteroids, neuroleptics for nausea and
vomiting, and sympathomimetics for the treatment of dyspnea—and other
treatment factors can negatively impact sleep patterns. Side effects of treatment that may affect the sleep-wake cycle include the following:[11];[9][Level of evidence: II] Pain. Anxiety. Night sweats/hot flashes. For more information, see Hot Flashes and Night Sweats. GI disturbances (e.g., incontinence, diarrhea, constipation, or nausea). GU disturbances (e.g., incontinence, retention, or GU irritation). Respiratory disturbances. Fatigue. Sustained use of the following can cause insomnia: Sedatives and hypnotics (e.g., glutethimide, benzodiazepines, pentobarbital, chloral hydrate, secobarbital sodium, and amobarbital sodium). Anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin). Corticosteroids. Oral contraceptives. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Methyldopa. Propranolol. Atenolol. Alcohol. Thyroid preparations. In addition, withdrawal from the following substances may cause insomnia: Central nervous system depressants (e.g., barbiturates, opioids, glutethimide, chloral hydrate, methaqualone, ethchlorvynol, alcohol, and over-the-counter and prescription antihistamine sedatives). Benzodiazepines. Major tranquilizers. Tricyclic and monamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants. Illicit drugs (e.g., marijuana, cocaine, phencyclidine, and opioids). Hypnotics can interfere with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, resulting in increased irritability, apathy, and diminished mental alertness. Abrupt withdrawal of hypnotics and sedatives may lead to symptoms such as: Nervousness. Jitteriness. Seizures. REM rebound. REM rebound is a marked increase in REM sleep, with increased frequency and intensity of dreaming, including nightmares.[12] The increased physiological arousal that occurs during REM rebound may be dangerous for patients with peptic ulcers or a history of cardiovascular problems. Newer medications for insomnia have reduced adverse effects.[13] The sleep of hospitalized patients is likely to be frequently interrupted by treatment schedules, hospital routines, and roommates, which singularly
or collectively alter the sleep-wake cycle.  Other factors influencing
sleep-wake cycles in the hospital setting include patient age, comfort, pain, anxiety, environmental noise, and temperature.[14] Consequences of sleep disturbances can influence outcomes of therapeutic and
supportive care measures.[15]  The patient with mild to moderate sleep disturbances
may experience irritability and inability to concentrate, which may in turn
affect compliance with treatment protocols, the ability to make
decisions, and relationships with significant others.  Sleep disturbances can also cause depression and anxiety.  Supportive care measures are
directed toward promoting quality of life and adequate rest. Savard J, Morin CM: Insomnia in the context of cancer: a review of a neglected problem.

Sleep 23 (2): 243-308, 2000. [PUBMED Abstract] Assessment is the initial step in managing sleep disturbances in people with cancer.  Assessment data
should include the following:[1] Documentation of predisposing factors. Sleep patterns. Emotional
status. Exercise and activity levels. Diet. Symptoms. Medications. Caregiver
routines. The sections below outline recommendations for a sleep history
and physical examination.  Data can be retrieved from multiple sources, such as:[2] The
patient’s subjective report of sleep difficulty. Objective observations of
behavioral and physiological manifestations of sleep disturbances. Reports
from the patient's significant other regarding the patient's quality of
sleep. The Insomnia Severity Index, which has been validated in adult oncology populations, is recommended when screening for insomnia in clinical settings.[3,4] In a 2021 study, the Insomnia Severity Index was validated in young adult (18–40 years of age) cancer survivors.[5] The diagnosis of insomnia is primarily based on a careful, detailed medical and
psychiatric history.  The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has produced
guidelines for the use of polysomnography as an objective tool in evaluating
insomnia.  The routine polysomnogram includes the monitoring of the following: Electroencephalography. Electro-oculography. Electromyography. Effort of breathing and air flow. Oxygen
saturation. Electrocardiography. Body position. Polysomnography is the
major diagnostic tool for assessment of sleep disorders. It is indicated in the evaluation of
suspected sleep-related breathing disorders and periodic limb movement
disorder, when the cause of insomnia is uncertain, or when behavioral or
pharmacological therapy is unsuccessful.[6] Sleep disturbances have been shown to change throughout the cancer trajectory, which supports the need to assess sleep throughout the patient’s cancer experience. One descriptive study [7][Level of evidence: II] involving 398 women with breast cancer used the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS) to identify three different sleep trajectories when self-reported sleep was evaluated beginning before surgery and continuing for 6 months. One group (55% of the sample) had a high level of sleep disturbance throughout the study, defined as scores on the GSDS of about 58 to 60 at all data points. A second group (40% of the sample) was considered to have a low level of sleep disturbance throughout, defined as scores on the GSDS in the low 30s at each data point. The final group (5% of the sample) started out high, with scores around 62, but their scores decreased to below 30 over the first 4 months and remained there through month 6. Participants identified as having a more severe sleep disorder were significantly younger, had more comorbidities, had a lower performance status, and experienced hot flashes. In another study, of 232 women with gynecologic cancers that assessed sleep using the GSDS at six time points over two cycles of chemotherapy,  four distinct subgroups of patients with sleep disturbance  were identified (Low, 18.5%; Moderate, 43.6%; High, 29.3%; Very High, 8.6%).[8][Level of evidence: II] Participants with the worst sleep disturbance were younger, had a higher body mass index, and were more likely to report depression or back pain. Sleep disturbances frequently co-occur with cancer-related fatigue and may have common underlying mechanisms. Prospective and multidimensional assessments of these two symptoms were conducted in a study involving patients who were newly diagnosed with stage I through stage IIIA breast cancer (N = 152).[9] Assessments included validated sleep and fatigue questionnaires and objective sleep assessments using wrist actigraphy, which measure sleep-wake patterns and circadian rhythms. Assessments were conducted before initiation of chemotherapy (T1) and during the last week of the fourth cycle of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (T2). Most patients in the group characterized by severe symptoms at T1 were also in a higher-symptoms group at T2. Similarly, many patients in that group at T1 remained in the minimal-symptoms group at T2. From T1 to T2, the average-symptoms group was relatively unstable compared with the severe- and minimal-symptoms groups. At both time points, younger patients reported more severe symptoms, and married patients reported less severe symptoms. Patients who reported more comorbidities, more use of medications, and other indicators of worse health (e.g., higher BMI) were more likely to be in the group characterized by higher symptom severity at both time points. In addition, stress can contribute to sleep disturbance. A study of 957 patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment for breast, lung, gastrointestinal, or gynecological cancer measured responses to validated stress/resilience assessment instruments (14-item Perceived Stress Scale,  22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, 30-item Life Stressor Checklist-Revised, and 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale). Compared with patients classified in a normative or resilient class, patients in the stressed class had significantly higher levels of sleep disturbance. Also, each of the domains of sleep disturbance within the validated 21-item GSDS (quantity, quality, sleep onset latency, mid-sleep awakening, early awakenings, and excessive daytime sleepiness) and use of medications to help with sleep were statistically significant and crossed clinically meaningful cutoff points for patients in the stressed class.[10] Risk Factors for Sleep Disorders Disease factors, including paraneoplastic syndromes with increased steroid
production, and symptoms associated with tumor invasion (e.g., obstruction,
pain, fever, shortness of breath, pruritus, and fatigue). Treatment factors, including symptoms related to surgery (e.g., pain,
frequent monitoring, and use of opioids), chemotherapy (e.g., exogenous
corticosteroids), and symptoms related to chemotherapy. Medications such as opioids; sedatives/hypnotics; steroids;
caffeine/nicotine; some antidepressants; and dietary supplements, including some
vitamins, diet pills, and other products promoting weight loss and appetite
suppression. Environmental factors. Physical and/or psychological stressors. Depression. For more information, see Depression. Anxiety. For more information, see the Anxiety Disorders: Description and Etiology section in Adjustment to Cancer: Anxiety and Distress. Delirium. Daytime seizures, snoring, and headaches. Characterization of Sleep Usual patterns of sleep, including usual bedtime, routine before retiring
(e.g., food, bath, and medications), length of time before onset of sleep,
and duration of sleep (waking episodes during night, ability to resume
sleep, and usual time of awakening). Characteristics of disturbed sleep (changes after diagnosis, treatment,
and/or hospitalization). The significant other's perception of the patient's quantity and quality of sleep. Family history of sleep disorders.

Staying asleep. Early-morning awakenings. Other areas to manage include  symptoms from cancer and its treatment and the identification and management of
environmental and psychological factors.  When sleep disturbances are caused by symptoms
of cancer or its treatment, measures that control or alleviate symptoms are often
the key to resolving sleep disturbances.  Management of sleep disturbances
combines nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches individualized for the
patient. Many people who experience insomnia have poor sleep hygiene (such as smoking and drinking excessive alcohol just before  bedtime), which can exacerbate or perpetuate insomnia.[1][Level of evidence: III]  A complete assessment of sleep hygiene (i.e., time in bed; napping during the day; intake of caffeine, alcohol, or foods that are heavy, spicy, or sugary; exercise; and sleep environment) and use of behavioral management strategies (i.e., fixed bedtime; restrictions on smoking,  diet, and excessive alcohol  4–6 hours before bedtime; and increased exercise) may prove effective in reducing sleep disturbances. Sleep hygiene in an inpatient setting involves modifying the sleep environment to decrease sleep disruption.  Minimizing
noise, dimming or turning off lights, adjusting room temperature, and
consolidating patient care tasks to reduce the number of interruptions can increase the
amount of uninterrupted sleep.[2][Level of evidence: IV] Cognitive strategies include:[3] Restructuring negative thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes related to sleep. Preventing excessive monitoring or worrying about getting enough sleep. Behavioral strategies include: Stimulus control. Sleep restriction. Both of these strategies seek to limit the time spent in bed that does not involve sleeping.[3-5] Several large randomized trials and meta-analyses provide the evidence base for the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia (CBT-I).[3,6,7]  Most of these trials have been in populations of patients without cancer. Components of CBT-I include the following: Cognitive restructuring. Behavioral strategies. Relaxation training.[4] Basic sleep hygiene education. Relaxation therapy can be used to achieve both behavioral and cognitive outcomes, particularly when it is combined with imagery.  Educational objectives around sleep hygiene are also used to treat insomnia and include content on the following:[4] Sleeping and waking up at regular times. Relaxing before bedtime. Creating a dark,  comfortable sleep environment. Avoiding watching television or working in the bedroom. Getting ample daylight during nonsleep hours. Avoiding naps. Limiting caffeine. Getting regular exercise but no closer than 3 hours before bedtime. Practice guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine clearly state that multicomponent therapy is recommended over single therapies.  Because of insufficient evidence about its efficacy, sleep hygiene education is not recommended as a single-modality management approach; other reviews state that sleep hygiene by itself is not effective.[6,8] Information about sleep hygiene should be included in patient education about sleep issues. Several trials and meta-analyses have shown CBT-I to be  at least as effective as conventional pharmacological therapies in treating primary  chronic insomnia but without side effects.[6,7,9-11] A  four-arm study (conducted in patients with primary chronic insomnia) that  evaluated zolpidem versus CBT versus zolpidem and CBT versus placebo reported a greater effect (P = .05) on sleep-onset latency for both groups involving CBT (change of 44%) versus the group receiving zolpidem alone (change of 29%).[12]  Another study, also conducted in patients with primary chronic insomnia, evaluated CBT with temazepam alone versus a combination of CBT and temazepam versus placebo and found that all active treatments were significantly better than placebo and that there was a trend for the most improvement in the combined arm of CBT and temazepam.[13]   Both arms with CBT demonstrated greater reductions in time to sleep onset than the pharmacotherapy-alone arm (64% in the combined arm, 55% in the CBT arm, and 47% in the temazepam arm).  A meta-analysis examining pharmacological and behavioral studies for persistent insomnia found that pharmacological and behavioral treatments did not differ in magnitude of benefit except for latency to sleep onset, in which greater reductions were found with behavioral therapy.[7] There are limited data evaluating elements of CBT-I in cancer survivors, and most data are about women with breast cancer.  However, there have been at least four randomized controlled trials of CBT-I in cancer survivors.[14-17]  The intervention was typically delivered over five to eight weekly, small-group, in-person sessions.   One trial included patients with cancer diagnoses other than breast cancer,[16] and results did not differ by cancer diagnosis. All studies showed improvements in numerous sleep parameters over time in the groups receiving CBT-I  and demonstrated continued benefits 6 and 12 months later.  Two of the four trials did not use active control arms.[14,16] Most studies using active control arms were in breast cancer survivors. One study compared CBT-I with sleep education and hygiene in 72 women,[15] while the other study used a healthy-eating education control group.[17]     In the first study, both groups significantly improved over time, with some significant differences between groups favoring CBT-I for time to fall asleep, time awake after sleep, total sleep time, and overall sleep quality.  For example, the group receiving CBT-I improved by 30 minutes in time to fall asleep, compared with 11 minutes in the sleep education and hygiene group.[15] In the second study, 219 women were randomly assigned to a behavioral therapy group consisting of stimulus control, general sleep hygiene (limiting naps, going to bed and rising at consistent times), and relaxation or to a healthy-eating education control group. The interventions were delivered by trained nurses in person, 2 days before the  initiation of chemotherapy, before each chemotherapy treatment, and 30 days after the last chemotherapy treatment.  The nurses worked with women assigned to behavioral therapy to individualize and reinforce the behaviors.  The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure subjective  sleep quality, complemented by use of  a sleep diary and 
wrist actigraph.  Sleep quality significantly improved in the group receiving behavioral therapy, compared with the control group.  These differences were also seen in data  from the sleep diary and actigraph, with both showing significantly fewer awakenings in the behavioral therapy group.[18]  Sleep quality was significantly better at 90 days and at 1 year in the behavioral therapy group, as measured by  the PSQI but not the diary or actigraph.[17] In some places, patients may not have access to in-person, professionally delivered CBT-I.   A randomized controlled trial conducted with breast cancer survivors demonstrated that CBT-I delivered via digital media can also produce meaningful clinical improvements, although improvements are not as robust as those produced with professionally delivered CBT-I. This three-armed trial compared video-based CBT-I (VCBT-I) and professionally delivered CBT-I (PCBT-I) with a no-treatment control group in 242 breast cancer survivors. Both the VCBT-I and PCBT-I groups had significantly greater improvements in diary-measured sleep variables, compared with the control group. The patients in the PCBT-I group reported greater improvements in some sleep outcomes and in fatigue and depression levels than did the VCBT-I group.[19] CBT delivered by psychologists has shown promise for the treatment of insomnia in patients with cancer.[14][Level of evidence: I] A randomized controlled study investigated the effectiveness of a protocol-driven cognitive behavioral intervention for insomnia delivered by oncology nurses.[16][Level of evidence: I] This group intervention consisted of standard CBT components such as stimulus control and sleep restriction.  Participants included patients with heterogeneous cancers randomly assigned to receive the intervention (n = 100) or treatment as usual (n = 50). Primary outcomes were sleep diary measures at baseline, posttreatment, and at 6-month follow-up. CBT was associated with significant and sustained improvements in several sleep aspects. These improvements were seen for both subjective (sleep diary) and objective (actigraphy) assessments. Additionally, patients who received CBT showed significant improvements in fatigue, anxiety, and depressive symptoms and reported improved quality of life, compared with patients who received treatment as usual.[16][Level of evidence: I] A study conducted in cancer survivors demonstrated the benefits of a specialized yoga program to improve sleep quality and reduce medication use. A total of 410 cancer survivors with moderate to severe sleep disturbances were randomly assigned to receive standard care or standard care plus a 4-week yoga intervention delivered in two weekly sessions by trained yoga instructors. The yoga participants showed significant improvement in sleep quality, daytime dysfunction, nighttime awakening, and sleep efficiency, compared with standard-care participants. One major limitation of this study was its limited population generalizability, as most study participants were female, White, married, and well-educated breast cancer survivors. Another major limitation was the lack of an adequate control group with respect to nonspecific effects such as group support and attention.[20] Exercise interventions have shown positive effects on subjective and objective sleep quality in patients with cancer. A study conducted in Taiwanese patients with lung cancer  investigated the effects of a 12-week exercise intervention on sleep quality and rest-activity rhythms.[21] The intervention included a home-based walking exercise regimen (walking at a moderate intensity for 40 minutes, 3 times per week) and weekly exercise counseling. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 56) or the usual-care group (n = 55). Assessments conducted at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months included a subjective sleep assessment using the PSQI and objective sleep and rest-activity assessment using actigraphy. Over time, the walking exercise group showed significant improvement in subjective sleep quality (lower PSQI scores) compared with the usual-care group. The walking exercise group also showed improvement in total sleep time (TST), an important objective measure of sleep quality, compared with the usual-care group.  Additionally, the positive effects on TST (i.e., increase in TST) were greater in patients with poor rest-activity rhythm at baseline, suggesting more benefits in patients with poor circadian sleep-activity rhythms. The limitations of the study included a lack of blinding, hence a possible placebo effect in the intervention group. Also, despite  randomization, the mean amount of baseline moderate physical activity was higher in the usual-care group than in the intervention group. Other actions or interventions that may promote rest in the hospital or extended-care setting include the following:[22,23] Keeping the patient's skin clean and dry. Giving back rubs and/or massaging areas of the body to bring comfort to the patient (e.g., bony prominences, head and scalp, shoulders, hands,
and feet). Keeping bedding and/or surfaces of support devices (chairs and pillows) clean,
dry, and wrinkle-free. Ensuring adequate bedcovers for warmth. Regulating fluid intake to avoid frequent awakening for elimination. Encouraging bowel and bladder elimination before sleep. Promoting optimal bowel function (increased fluids, dietary fiber, and use of
stool softeners and laxatives). Using a condom catheter for nocturnal incontinence. Providing a high-protein snack 2 hours before bedtime (e.g., milk,
turkey, or other foods high in tryptophan). Avoiding beverages with caffeine and other stimulants, including dietary
supplements that promote metabolism changes and appetite suppression. Encouraging the patient to dress in loose, soft clothing. Facilitating comfort through repositioning and support with pillows as
needed. Encouraging activity and being out of bed as much as possible during waking hours. Encouraging the patient to keep regular bedtime and waking hours and avoid napping during the day. Minimizing and coordinating necessary bedside contacts. Psychological interventions are directed toward facilitating the patient's
coping processes through education, support, and reassurance.  As the patient
learns to cope with the stresses of illness, hospitalization, and treatment,
sleep may improve.[24][Level of evidence: IV] Communication, verbalization of concerns, and openness between the patient, family, and health care team should be encouraged.  Relaxation exercises and self-hypnosis performed at
bedtime can help promote calm and sleep.  Cognitive-behavioral
interventions that diminish the distress associated with early insomnia and
change the goal from “need to sleep” to “just relax” can diminish anxiety and
promote sleep.[25] When cancer survivors experience sleep-wake disturbances, cognitive behavioral intervention counseling should be the first consideration for management.  For more information, see the Nonpharmacological Management of Sleep Disturbances section. Resources for education and training in CBT may not be readily available in many cancer centers; therefore, community resources need to be investigated.  If CBT is not available or has not been successful, pharmacological management can be considered.  In addition, when patients have comorbidities contributing to sleep-wake cycle disturbances (such as hot flashes, uncontrolled pain, anxiety, depression, or other mood disturbances),[26,27] then pharmacological management will probably be necessary.  While many pharmacological agents are approved for primary insomnia and many others are used off-label to manage sleep and related symptoms, most of the approved sleep aids have not been studied in cancer populations; therefore, the risk/benefit profiles of these drugs are not delineated in this setting. Despite the lack of evidence in cancer populations, clinicians widely use pharmacological interventions.  Therefore, the following discussion of pharmacological agents and recommendations for use is based on evidence from studies conducted in patients with primary insomnia and clinical experience.[4,28,29] Several classes of medications are used to treat sleep-wake cycle disturbances, including the following: Nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g., zolpidem). Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam). Melatonin receptor agonists (e.g., ramelteon). Antihistamines (e.g., hydroxyzine). Antidepressants (e.g., trazodone) and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine) that have sedative effects. Drug characteristics to consider before a drug is chosen to treat an individual patient include the following: Absorption. Time to reach maximum concentration. Elimination half-life. Receptor activity. Ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Dose and frequency. Formulation (short-acting versus long-acting). These pharmacokinetic principles are important to match the agent to the type of sleep disturbance (e.g., problems falling asleep versus problems staying asleep).  There are also safety issues to be considered, such as potentials for tolerance, abuse, dependence, withdrawal (including risk of rebound insomnia), and drug-drug and drug-disease interactions. Medications for sleep-wake cycle disturbances should be used short term and/or as needed. Medications used to induce sleep are intended for the short-term management of sleep disorders.  The use of these medications for longer periods is poorly studied. They are usually combined with lifestyle changes that reinforce good sleep habits and negate the need for chronic hypnotic medications. Most research studies of current and historic hypnotic medications rarely exceed a duration of 12 to 16 weeks.    Additionally, no current hypnotic re-creates normal sleep architecture, and variations from normal periods of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep are common.  It is important to taper hypnotic medications slowly, or the variations in normal sleep patterns can become even more pronounced, with the majority of time spent in REM sleep in a condition known as REM rebound.[30,31] Table 3 lists the drug categories and specific medications, including doses, commonly used to treat sleep disturbances. All agents in this class are FDA approved for primary insomnia. These agents promote sleep by enhancing the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA type A (GABAA) receptor. Unlike traditional benzodiazepines, these agents preferentially target specific GABAA receptor subtypes. Zolpidem and zaleplon  bind predominantly to the alpha-1 subtype of GABAA, and eszopiclone preferentially targets the  alpha-3 receptor subtype. This selective receptor subtype targeting has both advantages and disadvantages. These agents have mainly hypnotic/sedative effects and lack the anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and myorelaxant effects seen with benzodiazepines. Conversely, because of the selective receptor subtype targeting, these agents have fewer effects on cognitive and psychomotor function and carry less risk of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal (especially physical withdrawal) than benzodiazepines.[4,28,29] These agents may be preferred for use in patients with cancer when only hypnotic effects are desired  and should be taken just before bedtime (or even in bed)  because they enter the brain very quickly. Some of these agents (e.g., zaleplon) have a short elimination half-life. Because of their longer-lasting effects, zolpidem extended-release and eszopiclone are preferred in the  treatment of  difficulty staying asleep. However, these agents carry a higher risk of residual morning sedation and cognitive/motor impairments than do agents with shorter elimination half-lives (e.g., zaleplon and immediate-release zolpidem). Benzodiazepines target several GABAA receptor subtypes, including alpha-1, -2, -3, and -5, and work by enhancing GABA effects at these receptors. In addition to hypnotic/sedative effects, these agents also have anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and myorelaxant effects. Benzodiazepines are preferred when other effects (such as antianxiety or muscle relaxation) are desirable with or without the hypnotic effects.[4,28,29] Benzodiazepines carry a much higher risk of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal than nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists. Benzodiazepine withdrawal has been associated with the risk of seizures, delirium tremens, autonomic instability, and death. These agents should be used with extreme caution and close monitoring in patients with histories of significant substance use because of potential tolerance and dependence issues. Benzodiazepines have also been associated with cognitive impairment and difficulties with motor coordination. Generally, benzodiazepines with longer half-lives (e.g., clonazepam) are associated with a higher risk of residual morning sedation and cognitive/motor impairments. Agents with shorter elimination half-lives (e.g., lorazepam) are generally preferred for short-term anxiolytic effects and difficulties falling asleep and in older patients. Agents with longer half-lives (e.g., clonazepam) are preferred for the treatment of persistent anxiety and difficulties falling and staying asleep. All benzodiazepines are associated with risk of respiratory depression and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting respiratory disorders. Ramelteon and tasimelteon work by binding to the melatonin receptor types MT1 and MT2. Ramelteon is useful only for the treatment of difficulties falling asleep and does not have any other effects, such as anxiolytic or myorelaxant effects. Tasimelteon is indicated for use in circadian sleep disorder. These agents do not treat difficulties staying asleep but also carry much less risk of cognitive/motor impairments and dependence.[28,29,39] Diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine decrease arousal by blockading histamine receptors. Antihistamines are sold over the counter and are useful for treating difficulties in falling asleep only. There is limited evidence for the use of antihistamines to treat insomnia; these agents are used when traditional hypnotics or benzodiazepines are less suitable because of the  risk of cross-dependence or other issues, such as vulnerability of a patient to addictions. The anticholinergic properties of antihistamines may also be beneficial in the treatment of nausea and vomiting. The sedative and anticholinergic properties of these agents increase the risk of delirium, especially in older patients.[28,29] Sedating antidepressants are considered first-line agents when insomnia is comorbid with depression/anxiety symptomatology. These drugs  include tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) and second-generation antidepressants (e.g., mirtazapine). The sedating effects of tricyclic antidepressants are caused mainly by  histamine receptor blockading and partially by blockading of 5-HT2 and muscarinic receptors. The sedating effects of mirtazapine are caused by  its blocking of 5-HT2 and histamine receptors, while those of trazodone are caused by  its blocking actions at the at histamine, 5-HT, and noradrenaline receptors.[4,28,29] For more information, see the Pharmacological Intervention section in Depression. Tricyclic antidepressants have a small therapeutic window and can be lethal in overdose, compared with second-generation antidepressants such as mirtazapine. Additionally, tricyclics carry other risks, such as weight gain, anticholinergic side effects, and cardiovascular side effects, and should be used under close supervision.  These agents sometimes are used in low doses (see Table 3) as adjuncts to other antidepressants to treat insomnia comorbid with depression/anxiety. This helps to avoid the side effects associated with higher doses while delivering the needed sedating effects. Tricyclics can also boost appetite and may be the treatment of choice for insomnia in patients with comorbid cachexia. Certain tricyclics (amitriptyline and nortriptyline) can also be beneficial in the treatment of pain syndromes (e.g., neuropathic pain) and headaches when these issues are comorbid with insomnia. Low doses of antidepressants (subtherapeutic for depression) are frequently used to treat insomnia without any comorbidities. Mirtazapine has appetite-stimulating and antiemetic properties in addition to sedating effects. It is frequently used  in insomniac patients with depression (therapeutic dose for depression, 15–45 mg) or without depression (subtherapeutic dose for depression, 7.5–15 mg) with comorbid nausea or loss of appetite. In low doses, trazodone (50–100 mg) can promote sleep and is often combined with other antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine 20 mg in the morning) in depressed patients with insomnia. Antipsychotics such as quetiapine have sedating effects caused  mainly by the blockade of histamine receptors. However, these agents should be considered as a last resort and as a short-term treatment because of  their serious side-effect profile. The use of antipsychotics has been associated with the following: Weight gain. Metabolic syndrome. Diabetes. Cardiovascular risks. The risk of extrapyramidal side effects, including tardive dyskinesia. Antipsychotics can be considered for treatment-refractory insomnia, especially with comorbid anxiety symptomatology.[28] Chloral hydrate has sleep-promoting effects resulting from its effects on GABA systems. It is associated with risk of withdrawal symptoms similar to those of benzodiazepines and with rapid development of tolerance. Additionally, chloral hydrate carries the risk of gastric irritation and multiple drug interactions, and it is lethal in overdose. Like antipsychotics, chloral hydrate is usually considered only in cases of treatment-refractory insomnia because of its serious side-effect profile and the availability of safer alternatives.[28] Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland during the hours of darkness,
plays a major role in the sleep-wake cycle and has been linked to the circadian rhythm. A review found that short-term use of melatonin appears to be safe; however, the studies were not conducted in the context of cancer therapy.[40] Adjuvant melatonin may also improve sleep disruption
caused by drugs known to alter normal melatonin production (e.g., beta-blockers
and benzodiazepines).[41][Level of evidence: IV] However, a meta-analysis of 25 studies exploring the efficacy and safety of melatonin in managing secondary sleep disorders or sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction found that melatonin was not effective in these conditions.[42] Evidence suggests that circulating melatonin levels are significantly lower
in physically healthy older people and in insomniacs than in age-matched
control subjects.  In view of these findings, melatonin replacement therapy may
be beneficial in the initiation and maintenance of sleep in older patients.[43][Level of evidence: II] A slow-release formulation of melatonin is licensed in Europe and is approved as monotherapy for patients aged 55 years or older for the short-term treatment (up to 13 weeks) of primary insomnia characterized by poor-quality sleep.  
However, melatonin replacement as a treatment for insomnia has not been studied in older people with
cancer. Ramelteon and tasimelteon work via the melatonin receptor system: ramelteon to support the initiation of sleep, and tasimelteon to correct circadian sleep disorder. Melatonin may interact with certain chemotherapeutic regimens via the cytochrome P450 enzyme and other systems.[44] It may augment the effects of some chemotherapeutic agents metabolized via the enzyme CYP1A2 and may exert inhibitory effects on P-glycoprotein–mediated doxorubicin efflux. Clinical studies in individuals with renal, breast, colon, lung, and brain cancer suggest that melatonin exerts anticancer effects in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation therapy; however, evidence remains inconclusive.[45,46]  All of the studies suggesting antitumor effects of melatonin have been conducted by the same group of investigators and were open label. Efforts by independent groups of investigators are under way to investigate these effects in carefully designed, randomized, blinded studies.[45] In vitro and animal studies have demonstrated the anticancer effects of exogenous melatonin, and lower melatonin levels are associated with tumor growth.[47] Human studies have yet to substantiate any causal or associative relationships. No studies have been conducted to specifically evaluate the effects of Cannabis inhalation or other Cannabis products in patients with primary or secondary sleep disturbances. Limited data from in vitro studies, animal studies, and small populations of healthy individuals or chronic Cannabis users are beginning to elucidate some of the relationships among various neurotransmitters, the sleep-wake cycle, and related effects of Cannabis pharmacology.[48,49] Cannabis-based medicines are under development as a treatment for  chronic pain syndromes, including cancer-related pain. One such medication is nabiximols (Sativex), an oromucosal formulation (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol mixed in a 1:1 ratio). Studies conducted with nabiximols, primarily focusing on pain syndromes, have shown improvement in subjective sleep quality when sleep was measured as a secondary outcome.[50]  Comorbidities such as pain are common reasons for sleep disturbances.  Concerns have been raised about the abuse and dependence potential of nabiximols, especially in the subpopulation of patients with histories of Cannabis use.[51] Nabiximols is approved in Canada for the treatment of central neuropathic pain in patients with multiple sclerosis. In the United States, it is only available for investigational use and is currently under investigation for the treatment of intractable cancer pain.

nonpharmacological pain management should be administered before introducing
sleep medications.  Tricyclic antidepressants can be particularly useful for
the treatment of insomnia in patients with neuropathic pain and depression. 
Patients on high-dose opioids for pain may be at increased risk for the
development of delirium and organic mental disorders.  Such patients may
benefit from the use of low-dose neuroleptics as sleep agents (e.g.,
haloperidol 0.5–1 mg). Older patients frequently have insomnia due to age-related changes in sleep. 
The sleep cycle in this population is characterized by lighter sleep, more
frequent awakenings, and less total sleep time.  Anxiety, depression, loss of
social support, and a diagnosis of cancer are contributory factors in sleep
disturbances in older patients.[1] Sleep problems in older adults are so common that nearly one-half of all hypnotic
prescriptions written are for people older than 65 years.  Although normal
aging affects sleep, the clinician should evaluate the many factors that cause
insomnia, such as:[2] Medical illness. Psychiatric illness. Dementia. Alcohol
and/or polypharmacy. Restless legs syndrome. Periodic leg movements. Sleep
apnea syndrome. Nonpharmacological treatment of sleep disorders is the preferred
initial management, with the use of medication when indicated and referral to
a sleep disorder center when specialized care is necessary.[2] Providing a regular schedule of meals, discouraging daytime naps, and
encouraging physical activity may improve sleep.  Hypnotic prescriptions for
older patients must be adjusted for variations in metabolism, increased fat
stores, and increased sensitivity.  Dosages should be reduced by 30% to 50%. 
Problems associated with drug accumulation (especially flurazepam) must be
weighed against the risks of more severe withdrawal or rebound effects
associated with short-acting benzodiazepines.  An alternate drug for older
patients is chloral hydrate.[1] Anterior mandibulectomy can result in the development of sleep apnea.  All
patients with head and neck tumors who have had extensive anterior oral cavity
resection should be evaluated before decannulation of the tracheostomy tube. 
Subsequent flap and/or reconstruction of the lower jaw seems to prevent the
development of sleep apnea.  In contrast, facial sling suspension of the lower
lip does not prevent the development of sleep apnea.[3]  Assessment for
symptoms and preparation for the appearance of symptoms in this population
provide indications for interventions related to sleep apnea. Berlin RM: Management of insomnia in hospitalized patients.

Fatigue is an extreme sense of tiredness and lack of energy. It is different from simply being tired. It is distressing, debilitating, and can interfere with daily activities. Fatigue is the most common side effect of cancer treatment, but it can also be caused by a brain or spine tumor or medications used to treat side effects. Fatigue may be associated with the following changes: Cognitive changes, including difficulty speaking or concentrating, as well as short-term memory loss  Activity changes, including a decrease in physical activity  Life changes, including altered work, play, or study habits, and a decline in family interaction  Emotional changes, such as feeling sad  There are many ways you can manage and cope with fatigue: Keep a daily log of your fatigue and what you are doing to manage it using the My STORITM app or a journal. Track all the symptoms that you have. Fatigue can occur with other symptoms, such as pain, weakness, or sleep disturbance.  Try to conserve your energy. To do so, plan your tasks mindfully and set realistic expectations to prevent wasting energy. Prioritize and space out activities. Delegate the less essential tasks so you have energy for the things that matter most. Plan activities during the times you feel your best.  Explore self-care activities that can help you cope with and improve your fatigue, including diet, exercise, and sleep:
	Try to follow the diet your doctor or dietitian recommends. Eating five or six small meals and snacks throughout the day may help keep your metabolism working and control your blood sugar so your energy stays more stable. Eating enough protein and calories can help you maintain your strength.
Pack small, healthy snacks for when you are on the go, so you don’t find yourself feeling fatigued and without food.
Stay hydrated to prevent and improve fatigue. Aim for 8 cups of liquids each day. Limit your intake of caffeine and alcohol.
Ask your doctor about getting a referral to cognitive behavioral therapy or a registered dietician.
Employ mindfulness and stress reduction practices, such as meditation, journaling, or relaxation breathing.
Try to nap during the daytime for less than one hour, so it does not prevent you from getting a full night’s rest.  Try to follow the diet your doctor or dietitian recommends.

Try to nap during the daytime for less than one hour, so it does not prevent you from getting a full night’s rest.  Discuss any concerns you have with your doctor. Share the symptoms you’ve logged and your self-care activities. Ask your doctor when and how to report your symptoms, and which symptoms are urgent to report.  Report if your fatigue gets worse, if it is severe (e.g., difficulty completing daily tasks), or if it does not improve with your self-care activities.   Updated:

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. The NCI Best Case Series Program   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research. When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: What side effects can be expected? What are the risks related to this therapy? What benefits can be expected from this therapy? Do the known benefits outweigh the risks? Will the therapy affect conventional treatment? Is this therapy part of a clinical trial? If so, who is the sponsor of the trial? Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?

d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  NIH launches research network to evaluate emerging cancer screening technologies   News Releases   Posted:
February 21, 2024  240-760-6600 The Cancer Screening Research Network will evaluate emerging technologies for cancer screening, such as blood tests that can screen for several types of cancer. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has launched a clinical trials network to evaluate emerging technologies for cancer screening. The Cancer Screening Research Network (CSRN) will support the Biden-Harris administration’s Cancer Moonshot℠ by investigating how to identify cancers earlier, when they may be easier to treat. Eight groups have received funding from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of NIH, to carry out the initial activities of the network. “There are many cancers we still cannot reliably detect until it is so late that they become extremely difficult to treat,” said W. Kimryn Rathmell, M.D., Ph.D., director of NCI. “Emerging technologies such as multi-cancer detection tests could transform cancer screening and help to extend the lives of many more people. We need to be sure that these technologies work and understand how to use them so they benefit everyone.” Studies are needed, for example, to evaluate the benefits and harms of promising new technologies for cancer screening and to determine how best to incorporate these technologies into the standard of care. In 2024, the network will launch a pilot study, known as the Vanguard Study on Multi-Cancer Detection, to address the feasibility of using multi-cancer detection (MCD) tests in future randomized controlled trials. MCDs are blood tests that can screen for several types of cancers. The study will enroll up to 24,000 people to inform the design of a much larger randomized controlled trial. This larger trial will evaluate whether the benefits of using MCD tests to screen for cancer outweigh the harms, and whether they can detect cancer early in a way that reduces deaths. “Our goal is to systematically evaluate cancer screening technologies to understand how best to use them to ultimately save lives. Data collected through these clinical trials can be used to develop evidence-based guidelines for cancer screening,” said Lori M. Minasian, M.D., deputy director of the Division of Cancer Prevention at NCI. In its studies, the network aims to reach diverse populations that are receiving routine care in a variety of health care settings. Study sites are geographically diverse and include underserved populations. Study investigators will come from a variety of disciplines that are actively engaged in cancer screening. “We want to ensure that the organizations involved in this network will also be recruiting from populations historically underrepresented in clinical trials, which will make the data we generate as representative as possible,” Dr. Minasian said. “It is important to make sure that these new technologies benefit all Americans.” Initial funding will provide resources for study coordination, communication activities, statistics and data management, and accrual and enrollment of participants into clinical trials and studies. Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle will serve as the network’s coordinating and communications center and the statistics and data management center. The seven additional funded sites will lead efforts to enroll participants in their geographic and coverage areas and include: Henry Ford Health + Michigan State University Health Sciences in Detroit  Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine  OU Health Stephenson Cancer Center at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences in Oklahoma City  University of Colorado Cancer Center in Aurora  University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center in Chapel Hill  Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Inova, and Sentara Health  Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis  The Department of Defense Uniformed Services University and the Department of Veterans Affairs will also participate as sites funded by their respective agencies.

Research Articles   Research Articles  SELECT stands for the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial. SELECT was a clinical trial to see if one or both of these substances could help prevent prostate cancer when taken as dietary supplements. The trial was funded primarily by NCI and developed and carried out by SWOG, an international network of research institutions. Enrollment for the trial began in 2001 and ended in 2004. More than 400 sites in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada took part in the study. Over 35,000 men, age 50 and older at the start of the trial, participated in SELECT (1). SELECT was initially planned for a minimum of seven years and a maximum of 12 years of participants taking supplements, plus follow-up observation after the men finished taking their supplements. However, the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for the trial met on September 15, 2008, to review SELECT study data and found that selenium and vitamin E, taken alone or together did not prevent prostate cancer. Based on their recommendation, with SWOG and NCI agreement, SELECT participants were told in October 2008 to stop taking their study supplements.. Although there were no statistically significant differences in the rates of prostate cancer between the four groups in the trial, there were more cases of prostate cancer in men taking only vitamin E. Statistical significance describes a mathematical measure of how sure one can be that a difference seen is not due to chance. In the 2008 report, there were also more new cases of diabetes in men taking only selenium compared with men taking placebo. This finding was also not statistically significant and did not prove an increased risk from selenium. Initial results of SELECT were published online in JAMA-Express on December 9, 2008, and appeared in the first print edition of JAMA in January 2009 (2). There was no difference in the incidence of lung or colorectal cancers, all cancers combined, all deaths combined, or the overall incidence of cardiovascular events between the study groups. The data published in 2011 include 18 months of additional follow-up information on the participants through July 5, 2011. During this time, SELECT men were no longer taking study supplements. These additional data provide an average of seven years of information on the participants: 5.5 years taking study supplements plus 1.5 years of observation or follow-up. The additional data show that the men who took vitamin E alone had a 17 percent relative increase in numbers of prostate cancers compared to men on placebo. This difference in prostate cancer incidence between the vitamin E only group and the placebos only group is now statistically significant, and not likely to be due to chance. Men taking selenium alone, or vitamin E and selenium, were also more likely to develop prostate cancer than men taking placebo, but those increases were smaller and are not statistically significant and may be due to chance. Updated results of SELECT were published in JAMA on October 12, 2011 (3). As with many medications, the actions of vitamin E may last long after the last pill is taken. The differences in prostate cancer incidence between the vitamin E group and the placebo group began to emerge at about the third year of study supplementation (see graph below of cumulative cases). The observation that the risk of prostate cancer has continued to increase suggests that vitamin E may have long-term effects on prostate cancer risk. There continued to be no differences in the incidence of lung or colorectal cancers, all cancers combined, all deaths combined, or the overall incidence of cardiovascular events between the study groups. Although initial results showed that more men taking selenium were diagnosed with diabetes, longer follow-up showed no increased risk of this disease. In SELECT, this measure means that there were 17 percent more prostate cancer cases diagnosed in the group of men assigned to take 400 International Units (IU) of vitamin E (and no selenium) daily compared to the men taking two placebos (no vitamin E and no selenium) after an average of seven years -- 5.5 of the years on supplements followed by 1.5 years not taking supplements. In the men in SELECT who took only placebos, after seven years, 65 prostate cancer cases were diagnosed for every 1,000 men. For the men assigned to take vitamin E only, for every 1,000 men, there were 76 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed (11 additional cases of prostate cancer per 1,000 men over seven years). The incidence rate of prostate cancer in the placebo arm of SELECT is similar to the incidence rate for men in the U.S. age 65 and older (4). Thus, the estimate of increased risk for men of SELECT age taking vitamin E supplements of 400 IUs daily would be about the same as for the men on SELECT taking vitamin E only (i.e. about 17 percent). In other words, if 1,000 men similar to those on SELECT were followed with annual physician visits, one would expect 65 of them to be diagnosed with prostate cancer over a seven year period. If these same men took 400 IUs of vitamin E daily for 5.5 years, researchers would expect 76 of them to be diagnosed with prostate cancer over a seven year period (i.e., 11 additional cases over seven years). There are many reasons why the vitamin E supplements may not have prevented prostate cancer. Two of the most likely reasons look back at the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta Carotene (ATBC) Cancer Prevention trial, a study designed to test vitamin E and beta carotene for lung cancer prevention in smokers (10). In the ATBC, a reduction in prostate cancer incidence was observed, but this secondary finding may have been due to chance, as the study was not designed to determine prostate cancer risk. Another possible reason that men in ATBC had a reduction in prostate cancer incidence, while men on SELECT did not, is that the dose of vitamin E used in SELECT (400 IU/day) was higher than the dose used in the ATBC (50 mg/day). Researchers sometimes talk about a "U-shaped response curve" where very low or very high blood levels of a nutrient are harmful but more moderate levels are beneficial; while the ATBC dose may have been preventive, the SELECT dose may have been too large to have a prevention benefit. Yes. In an analysis published in 2014, men who had high levels of selenium at the start of the trial, as assessed by measures of selenium in their toenail clippings, had almost double the chance of developing a high-grade prostate cancer if they took the selenium supplement compared to men with low levels of selenium at the start of the trial. This finding was unexpected, as previous studies had shown that men with low levels of selenium had an increased risk of prostate cancer that was reduced with supplements (11, 12). Additionally, men with low levels of selenium at the start of the trial had double the chance of developing a high-grade prostate cancer if they took the vitamin E supplement. Yes. In 2011, data showed that men taking vitamin E alone had a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer, but men taking vitamin E plus selenium did not. If men had low selenium levels at the start of the trial, the selenium supplement may have counteracted a negative effect of the vitamin E supplement. No. Scientists do not understand how these supplements really work and more importantly, the interactions that these supplements have together or with foods, drugs, or other supplements. There are no clinical trials that show a benefit from taking vitamin E or selenium to reduce the risk of prostate cancer or any other cancer or heart disease (2, 3, 5-9). While the men in SELECT who took both vitamin E and selenium did not have a statistically significant increase in their risk for prostate cancer, they also did not have a reduced risk of prostate cancer or any other cancer or heart disease. SELECT researchers were surprised by the findings in the men who took both vitamin E and selenium, and while the 2014 analysis suggests possible reasons for the findings, the mechanism remains unclear. At the time SELECT was being designed, trials to test vitamin E in other common diseases were also under way. These trials were studying 400 IU to 660 IU of vitamin E to prevent macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, or heart disease. Preliminary evidence suggested the outcomes would be favorable. SELECT researchers matched the doses in these trials to ensure data at the 400 IU dose was available if using the supplement for other diseases became common. The form of vitamin E given was dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, the form of vitamin E found to reduce prostate cancer incidence in the ATBC. Probably not, but the number of African American men in the trial is too small to be certain that separate analyses would be statistically sound. In SELECT, African American men were permitted to join the trial at a younger age than men of other races (at age 50 vs. 55) because of their increased risk of prostate cancer. About 12 percent of the participants (4,314 of 34,888) identified themselves as African-American, and they were represented equally across the study arms (as would be expected in a randomized trial). Although this percentage reflects the proportional representation of African Americans in the United States, the number of men is not large enough to do thorough, separate statistical analyses of each SELECT study endpoint. However, SELECT researchers did look at cancer rates and other measures by race and did not see any differences in the response to the supplements. SELECT was a randomized, controlled clinical trial. The men who participated took two capsules a day. They were randomly assigned (that is, assigned by chance) to receive: Selenium and vitamin E  Selenium and a placebo  Vitamin E and a placebo, or  Two placebos. Two placebos were used in the trial: one looked like a selenium capsule; the other looked like a vitamin E capsule. Each placebo contained only inactive ingredients. Neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received the selenium and vitamin E, or the placebos, a process known as blinding or masking. 23.  African-American men had to be age 50 or older to participate, and men of other races and ethnicities had to be 55 or older. The age for eligibility was lower for African-American men because, on average, they develop prostate cancer at an earlier age and have an overall increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Many diseases, including prostate cancer, occur more frequently in older persons. The risk of developing prostate cancer increases with age. More than 90 percent of prostate cancer cases occur in men age 55 or older (4). Participants diagnosed with prostate cancer during the study underwent treatment within their community, based upon community treatment standards. These participants continued to be followed by the SELECT study staff. Costs for diagnosis and treatment of prostate problems, prostate cancer, or other medical conditions during the study were charged to the participant in the same way as if he were not part of the trial. A participant's insurance should pay for diagnosis and treatment according to the plan's policies. If the participant has no insurance, social services may be available at the local level to cover costs for diagnosis and treatment. Researchers don't know why. There are several possible explanations why selenium supplements did not prevent prostate cancer in men on SELECT. These reasons include: The findings of reduced prostate cancer incidence associated with selenium supplementation in the Nutritional Prevention of cancer (NPC) study may not have been correct and selenium may not affect prostate cancer risk.  The participants in the NPC study were deficient in selenium compared to the men in SELECT who were not selected because of a likely selenium-deficiency; it may be that selenium only reduces the risk of prostate cancer in selenium-deficient men and not in the general population.  The supplements given to the men in SELECT may have exceeded the best dose to prevent prostate cancer.  The formulation of selenium used in the NPC trial (high-selenium yeast) may have been more active than the l-selenomethionine used in SELECT and this may have prevented researchers from seeing a cancer prevention effect. Arguing against this was the fact that early tests showed that, for the selenium yeast, the amount of selenium per dose varied in the NPC trial – this was why this form of selenium was not used in SELECT. Additionally, the inorganic compounds present in the yeast can be toxic and can lead to lower body reserves of selenium. The SELECT biorepository data and samples will help to support research that may answer this question.  (1)        Lippman SM, Goodman PJ, Klein EA, et al.

Therefore, the information in this summary is no longer being updated and is provided for reference purposes only. This cancer information summary provides an overview of the Gonzalez regimen as a treatment for  people with cancer. The summary includes a brief history of the science and philosophies of care that have influenced development of the regimen, the results of research and clinical studies, and side effects that have been associated with this treatment approach. This summary contains the following key information: The Gonzalez regimen is a complex cancer treatment that is tailored by the practitioner for each specific patient. Existing clinical data concerning the effectiveness of the Gonzalez regimen as a treatment for cancer are limited with conflicting results. Pancreatic enzymes taken orally are the primary agents within the regimen thought to have direct antitumor effects.  The enzymes are derived from porcine (pig) sources. The regimen also includes specific diets, vitamin and mineral supplements, extracts of animal organs, and coffee enemas. The Gonzalez regimen is currently available only to the patients in one clinical practice. A variety of diet regimens similar to those in the Gonzalez regimen are associated with cancer prevention,   but none have been shown to be effective as cancer treatments. Compliance with the Gonzalez regimen may be extremely difficult for patients because of the large number of pills taken per day (150) and the strict dietary protocols. Many of the medical and scientific terms used in this summary are hypertext linked (at first use in each section) to the NCI Dictionary    of Cancer Terms, which is oriented toward nonexperts. When a linked term is clicked, a definition will appear in a separate window.

Their inclusion should not be viewed as an endorsement of the content of the websites, or of any treatment or product, by the PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board or the National Cancer Institute. The Gonzalez regimen combines prescribed diets, nutritional supplements, coffee enemas, and 
pancreatic enzymes in a cancer management program. The regimen is intended to detoxify the body, correct nervous system imbalances that might lead to impaired general health, and support natural immune processes. The pancreatic enzymes are thought to be the specific anticancer component of the Gonzalez program.[1-3] Two major concepts underlie use of the Gonzalez regimen in cancer treatment. The first concept is that the pancreas, like the liver, is an organ that performs a detoxification function and that pancreatic enzymes help the body eliminate toxins and help normal cells repair damaged cells.[2]  The second concept is that cancer and most other human illness are related to physiological imbalances created by environmental toxins either consumed in food or contacted in the environment.[2,3] Proponents of the Gonzalez regimen believe that toxins from sources such as processed foods and environmental pollution are responsible for human cancers. These toxins are thought to accumulate in tissues and over time create imbalances in the autonomic nervous system, diminish the normal immune response, and give rise to cellular damage that can lead to cancer.[2,3] If these toxins could be neutralized and eliminated from the body, proponents believe, both early and established cancers would be halted, and general health would be restored.[2,3] According to the developer of the Gonzalez regimen, the diets used in this regimen are chosen for each patient according to individual metabolic profiles  established at the time of initial evaluation through various tests, including hair analysis.  There are ten    basic diets and 90 variations.[2] The diets emphasize organic foods. Each diet carries a particular focus and can range from strictly vegetarian diets to diets high in meat and fat. Variations in the diets correlate with the theory that imbalances in the autonomic nervous system are exacerbated by a diet that is inappropriate for the patient’s metabolic type.[2,3] Nutritional supplements employed in the Gonzalez regimen include vitamins, minerals, trace elements, amino acids, and extracts of animal organs (e.g., thymus and liver extracts from sheep or cows). As with the dietary protocols, the nutritional supplements are intended to correct autonomic nervous system imbalances.[2,3] The major feature of the Gonzalez regimen is  freeze-dried porcine pancreatic enzyme (PPE) administered in capsule form as part of the nutritional supplementation aspect of the program. Obtained from pigs, PPE is considered to be the primary cancer-fighting component in the regimen and to contribute to the overall detoxification process.[2] Proponents of the regimen believe that the pancreatic enzymes are delivered to the bloodstream and help the body eliminate and destroy abnormal cells, waste material, and abnormal proteins that are toxic to the body.  As the body detoxifies, the cancerous tumors tend to shrink.[2] Coffee enemas are also included as part of the detoxification process.  The enemas are administered twice daily.[3]   The use of coffee enemas is based on a belief that coffee introduced into the lower intestinal tract will improve liver function and stimulate emptying of the gallbladder, thereby enhancing the elimination of toxins and waste products from the body.[2,3] The Gonzalez regimen is available only to private patients of its New York-based practitioner. Pancreatic enzymes are sold in the United States as either prescription drugs indicated for pancreatic insufficiency [4] or over-the-counter (OTC) dietary supplements.   As of 2004, those sold as prescription drugs must have a New Drug              Approval  from the US   Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be marketed legally in the United States.   Pancreatic enzymes sold as OTC dietary supplements are regulated as foods, not drugs.   Dietary supplements in the United States are therefore sold without a requirement of a market approval by the FDA, as long as they do not claim to treat or prevent a specific disease or condition.  According to the developer of the Gonzalez regimen, most OTC preparations or other commercially available pancreatic enzymes are not effective against cancer.[3] For the FDA, PPE falls under the category of a new prescription drug that is under investigation.  To conduct clinical drug research in the United States, researchers must file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA. Only one group of investigators is known to have IND approval to study this pancreatic enzyme preparation as a treatment for cancer. The IND process is confidential, and the existence of an IND can be disclosed only by the applicant(s).

Last accessed April  11, 2016. Physician's Desk Reference 2005. 59th ed. Thomson PDR, 2005. The Gonzalez regimen was developed by Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez, who became interested in the use of pancreatic enzymes and dietary protocols as a possible treatment for cancer  as a second-year medical student when he learned of a cancer treatment approach developed by a Texas dentist, William Donald Kelley, D.D.S.  Dr. Kelley’s approach espoused, among other things, the use of pancreatic enzymes administered orally as anticancer agents.[1-5]  The use of enzymes as a treatment for cancer was originally proposed nearly a century ago [6] and then resurfaced in the work of  Dr. Max Gerson in the 1940s.[7] The Gonzalez regimen was developed from these earlier theories and approaches. A key concept underlying the original use of pancreatic enzymes for cancer treatment is  the trophoblastic theory of cancer.[8] When a human egg is fertilized by sperm, the early cell divisions produce a small ball of cells, which give rise to the blastocyst (preimplantation embryo). The blastocyst possesses a surrounding layer of cells known as the trophectoderm, which is made of individual cells called trophoblasts. Responsible for protecting the developing blastocyst and for mediating its attachment to the wall of the uterus, trophoblasts create the placenta. During the process of attaching the blastocyst to the uterine wall, trophoblasts express invasive qualities similar to those found in cancer cells. Trophoblasts, however, cease their invasive activity once the placenta is in place and functioning and then differentiate into other cell types.[8] When Scottish embryologist Dr. John Beard [6] first observed the invasive activity of trophoblasts in 1902, he speculated on the similarities between these cells and cancer cells. In addition, he observed that trophoblast invasiveness begins to decline at about the same time that the pancreas in the developing fetus begins to function. He also theorized that maternal pancreatic enzymes might play a role in containing trophoblastic invasiveness in the uterus. These considerations led to his proposal that cancer cells, like trophoblasts, arise from primordial germ cells.    Dr. Beard also thought  that some of these primordial cells—carrying latent capacities for invading tissues—could escape and spread throughout the body of the developing fetus. He thought it was possible that pancreatic enzymes modulated the degree of trophoblastic invasiveness in the uterus, he suggested that these same enzymes play a role in either limiting or eliminating cancerous cells elsewhere in the body.[6,8]  Dr. Beard worked before the advent of molecular biology and human genetics. Although unable to experimentally establish that pancreatic enzymes had anticancer effects, he published papers and a book about his theory between 1902 and 1911. Other scientists of the time raised significant objections to the trophoblastic theory of cancer, and it was never broadly accepted.[9] As Dr. Beard had before him, Dr. Kelley also asserted that trophoblasts and cancer cells have a common origin in primordial germ cells.  Dr. Kelley maintained, furthermore, that cancer was initiated when primordial germ cells migrated to a point in the body already weakened by toxic exposure and nervous system imbalance. At these presumably compromised sites, the germ cells met no opposition from the immune system and initiated an aggressive invasion of normal tissue, creating malignancy. Dr. Kelley’s treatment approach was based on the belief that primordial germ cells are the single cause of all cancers, no matter where they occur, and that pancreatic enzymes are able to suppress or destroy cancers.[1,5] Dr. Gonzalez incorporated many of Dr. Beard’s and Dr. Kelley’s key points into his own 
treatment regimen.  In addition, the Gonzalez regimen includes the rigorous dietary protocols, nutritional supplements, and coffee enemas that can be found in the earlier work of Dr. Max Gerson.[7]  The Gonzalez regimen now includes use of pancreatic enzymes, along with nutritional supplements, coffee enemas, and prescriptive diets based on a theory 
of autonomic dominance.[2-4] An example of the Gonzalez regimen for a patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma would be the following: A diet that emphasizes fresh raw fruits, raw and lightly steamed vegetables, and freshly made vegetable juice daily.  The diet protocol relies on plant-based sources such as cereals, nuts, and seeds and whole-grain products such as whole-grain bread and brown rice.  The patient may eat one or two eggs daily, whole-milk yogurt daily, and fish two or three times a week, but no red meat or poultry. Nutritional supplements that include vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Also prescribed are certain freeze-dried organ concentrates such as thymus and liver, derived from beef or lamb. Ingestion of 25 g to 40 g of porcine lyophilized pancreas product daily, in capsule form, taken away from meals and spread evenly throughout the day.[2] The total number of capsules taken per day by each cancer patient on the Gonzalez regimen   typically ranges from 130 to 160, taken with and away from meals.[2] In addition, the Gonzalez regimen uses coffee enemas on the premise that coffee absorbed through the intestinal wall will improve liver and gallbladder function and help increase the removal of toxic waste from tumor breakdown.[2,4]  At this time there is no scientific evidence that coffee enemas have any specific effects on increased liver function, effects on tumor breakdown detoxification, or a role in the treatment of any cancer. Doubts exist about the effectiveness of oral administration of pancreatic enzymes because pancreatic enzymes were not thought to be transported intact from the gut to the bloodstream.  Evidence now suggests that intact digestive enzymes can be absorbed and resecreted by the pancreas, in a manner similar to the liver recycling of bile salts and hormones.[10-12] Kelley WD: One Answer to Cancer.

Biochim Biophys Acta 1241 (3): 341-70, 1995. [PUBMED Abstract] Directly relevant laboratory or animal data concerning the anticancer potential of the Gonzalez regimen are limited. Published animal studies focus on the role of pancreatic enzymes in cancer treatment rather than the regimen as a whole. An animal study published in 1999 measured the ability of orally administered porcine pancreas preparation (PPP)  to slow or halt the growth of cancer and to inhibit metastasis.  Sixty Fischer F344 female rats were divided into five groups of 12 each.  All groups were fed the same basic diet.   After 5 days, R13762 transplantable rat mammary tumor was implanted into a mammary fat pad on each rat. The animals were maintained on their assigned diets for another 40 days.  After the tumors had taken hold, two groups were given a high dose of PPP (20% by weight) and two groups were given a lower dose (2% by weight). The fifth group was used as a control and received no enzymes.  In addition, one group from each of the PPP-dosed rat groups was also given a magnesium citrate supplement because magnesium is often given with PPP in clinical practice.[1] Results showed that PPP had no effect on tumor growth, and PPP alone did not show any significant effect on the amount of metastases.      However, when the rate of metastases in the
rats dosed at the 20% rate was compared with those dosed at 2%, it was noted that there was an increase in metastases in the rats given a higher dose of PPP. The lowest rate of metastases was seen in the rats given the 2% dose plus magnesium citrate.[1] In another study, the effects of porcine pancreatic enzyme (PPE) extracts on survival and tumor growth were examined in 5- to 6-week-old male beige X-linked immunodeficient  mice. In the survival study, two groups of mice received pancreatic cancer cells AsPc1 injected into their pancreas.                              The treatment group (14 mice) received PPE in water at a dose of 400 mg/kg of body weight, which corresponds to the dose used in patients receiving the Gonzalez regimen.  The control group (13 mice) was given only water. After death, the pancreas was removed and measured for volume and weight.  The median survival rates for the treatment group and the control group were 43.5 days and 35 days, respectively. At day 35, the survival rates were 79% in the treatment group and 38% in the control group.  In addition, the control mice showed reduced activity as compared with the treatment group, which showed normal activity and no signs of disease.  In general, the size of tumors and the rate of invasion in the liver and peritoneum correlated with length of survival time.[2] In the tumor growth segment of this study, a second group of 30 mice was taken through the same procedures.  Tumor size and weight were measured in two mice from each group on day 52, and again in two mice from the control group and five mice from the treatment group on day 60.  Ascites were much more apparent in the control group than in the treatment group. Physical activity among the treated mice was much greater than in the control group.  Results showed that the treatment group had significantly smaller tumors than the control group in both weight and volume.  The mean tumor weight was 1.2 g in the control group and 0.75 g in the treatment group.  The tumor volume was 0.42 cm3 in the treatment group and 0.91 cm3  in the control group.  All mice in the control group showed steatorrhea, hyperglycosuria, hyperbilirubinuria, and ketonuria in the early stages of tumor growth, whereas in the treated group only a few mice showed these abnormalities in the final stages. There were no differences in the tumors of the treatment and control groups in the expression of growth factors, epidermal growth factor receptor, or apoptotic rate.[2] Cohen LA, Aliaga C, Pittman B, et al.: Oral enzyme therapy and experimental rat mammary tumor metastasis.

Pancreas 28 (4): 401-12, 2004. [PUBMED Abstract] The anticancer efficacy of the Gonzalez regimen has been investigated in two human studies (CPMC-IRB-8544 [1]), both involving patients with pancreatic cancer. The first study, a prospective nonconsecutive case series conducted by the developer and an associate, included 11 patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (stage II through stage IV).  None of the patients had received chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and none had undergone surgical resection with curative intent.  All the patients had pancreatic tumors that were either unresected or partially resected.  Survival from the time of diagnosis was the only study endpoint, and all 11 patients (including one who left the study) were included in this survival analysis. The investigators reported a median survival time of 17 months and a mean survival time of 25.2 months for these patients.  Nine patients (82%) survived 1 year, five patients (45%) survived 2 years, and four patients (36%) survived 3 years.  At the time the study was reported, two patients were alive: one who had survived 3 years, and one  had survived 4 years. The researchers concluded that the 1-year and 2-year survival percentages for this group of patients were superior to those observed for other U.S. patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (1-year survival, all stages = 25%; 2-year survival, all stages = 10%).[1] The small number of patients in this study and the absence of a control group are limitations that raise doubts about the reliability of its findings. It is possible that important, unidentified differences between these patients and other patients diagnosed with stage II to stage  IV pancreatic cancer contributed to the relatively long survival. The investigators report that 25 additional patients with pancreatic cancer were seen during the study period but were excluded from study participation.  Eleven of these patients were excluded on the basis of  comorbidities, previous treatment, or delay between diagnosis and beginning the program; 14 otherwise eligible patients were excluded on the grounds that they chose not to start the program, complied only briefly, or predicted noncompliance.[1] The second study is a nonrandomized prospective case-control observational study  sponsored by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health  and the National Cancer Institute in which median survival and quality of life were found to be better in patients treated  with gemcitabine-based (i.e., other drugs may be included) chemotherapy than for patients treated with the Gonzalez regimen. This study was originally planned for randomization but changed after few patients elected to participate in the randomized trial. The  same eligibility criteria were used to select patients for both treatment arms. The results of this study were reported in the peer-reviewed Journal of Clinical Oncology.[2]               According to the report, 70 patients were evaluated for the study and 55 were enrolled: 23 in the gemcitabine arm and 32 in the enzyme treatment arm. The enzyme treatment included orally ingested proteolytic enzymes, nutritional supplements, detoxification, and an organic diet (as used in  the pilot study by Gonzalez and Isaacs).[1] Patients received three pancreatic enzyme capsules and two magnesium citrate capsules with each meal. The patients also took specified numbers of capsules with magnesium citrate and Papaya Plus every 4 hours on an empty stomach. The dose for patients with stage II disease was 69 enzyme capsules per day, and the dose for patients with stages III or stage IV was 81 capsules per day. After day 16, patients had a 5-day rest period and then resumed treatment on day 22. Patients in the experimental arm received proteolytic treatment under the care of a practitioner familiar with the regimen; those in the chemotherapy arm received treatment by the oncologist they selected.[2] Treatment could be adjusted by the physician, and it could be increased for cancer  progression.  The gemcitabine treatment patients received various gemcitabine-containing regimens, with 19 of the 23 patients receiving a combination of gemcitabine, capecitabine, and docetaxel. The two groups had similar clinical characteristics. The  median survival for the patients in the gemcitabine arm was 14 months and, on the enzyme arm, 4.3 months. The quality of life as measured by the FACT-PA was also better in the chemotherapy arm.  The paper does not list Dr. Gonzalez as an author, and does not identify him as participating in the study; however,  Dr. Gonzalez published comments on his website indicating his participation  in the study and detailing his concerns about how the study was conducted, including patient compliance with the prescribed treatment in the enzyme arm.[3] No data concerning the effectiveness of the Gonzalez regimen for the treatment of cancer  patients with other types of cancer have been reported, despite claims that a variety of cancers can be treated.    In addition, there is no safety or efficacy information on the regimen in children. No clinical trials of this regimen have been conducted in children, and this extremely difficult regimen may be prohibitive in young children.

The developer of the Gonzalez regimen has reported the following adverse effects associated with the regimen:   intestinal gas; occasional bloating and indigestion, apparently related to ingestion of porcine pancreatic enzyme; and flu-like syndromes,  allegedly associated with detoxification, including low-grade fever, nonspecific myalgia (muscle aches), and nonspecific skin rashes.[1,2] The cases found in the literature on coffee enema are not adequate to support an adverse effect from coffee enemas alone. There are rare reports of adverse events unrelated to the coffee enemas in patients receiving them.  It should be remembered that clinically significant changes in blood chemistries can occur with excessive use of enemas of any kind.[3-6] Gonzalez NJ, Isaacs LL: Evaluation of pancreatic proteolytic enzyme treatment of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, with nutrition and detoxification support.

One clinical study, a nonconsecutive case series involving 11 patients with pancreatic cancer, has been reported.[1]             Another clinical study involving 55 patients with pancreatic cancer was published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Clinical Oncology in August 2009.[2] No data concerning the effectiveness of the Gonzalez regimen in patients with other types of cancer have been reported. To assist readers in evaluating the results of human studies of integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies for cancer, the strength of the evidence (i.e., the levels of evidence) associated with each type of treatment is provided whenever possible. To qualify for a level of evidence analysis, a study must: Be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Report on a therapeutic outcome or outcomes, such as tumor response, improvement in survival, or measured improvement in quality of life. Describe clinical findings in sufficient detail that a meaningful evaluation can be made. Separate levels of evidence scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and scientific strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., endpoints)    measured. The resulting two  scores are then combined to produce an overall score.  For an explanation of the scores and additional information about levels of evidence analysis of CAM treatments for cancer, refer to Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies.

Cancer Model Development  Using HCMI   About Next-Gen Models  Cancer Model Development  NCI-supported cancer model development is a collaborative effort, which includes model development centers and model processing entities that provide clinical data, quality control, biospecimen processing, and molecular characterization.  About Cancer Model Development Centers  Locations of Centers and Processing Entities  Quality Controls and Process  About Cancer Model Development Centers Locations of Centers and Processing Entities Quality Controls and Process About Cancer Model Development Centers The Cancer Model Development Centers (CMDCs) are the NCI-supported contributors to the Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI). CMDCs are tasked with producing next-generation cancer models from clinical samples. The cancer models include tumor types that are rare, originate from patients from underrepresented populations, lack precision therapy, or lack cancer model tools. Throughout the development process, the CMDCs use stringent internal quality control measures to ensure both clinical and molecular integrity. These models' case-associated clinical, biospecimen, and molecular characterization data are available as a community resource. The CMDCs are: Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard:  The co-directors are Jesse S. Boehm, Ph.D. and Keith L. Ligon, M.D., Ph.D.  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory:  The principal investigator is David A. Tuveson, M.D., Ph.D. This CMDC includes two international subsites: 1) ARC-NET Centre for Applied Research on Cancer, University of Verona, co-led by Aldo Scarpa, M.D., Ph.D. and Vincenzo Corbo, Ph.D. and 2) Hubrecht Institute, led by Hans Clevers, M.D., Ph.D.  Stanford University:  The principal investigators are Calvin J.

Biospecimen Processing Center (green) is the Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, OH. Genome Characterization Centers (red) are at Broad Institute in Cambridge, MA, and University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, NC. The Genomic Data Commons (pink) is in Chicago, IL. The Clinical Data Coordinating Center (teal) is at the Information Management Services in Rockville, MD and American Type Culture Collection is in Manassas, VA. The web developer for HCMI's Searchable Catalog is at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (grey) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Quality Controls and Process The HCMI CMDC-specific model development and characterization pipeline involves multiple institutions. It includes several quality checkpoints, which ensure that the models and case-associated clinical, biospecimen, and molecular characterization data are complete and consistent. The models are first generated by the CMDCs and clinical data associated with the model's case is submitted to the Clinical Data Center. The Clinical Data Center quality-controlled clinical data for the model's case is sent to the Genomic Data Commons. Samples of normal tissue, parent tumor, and derived model are sent to the Biospecimen Processing Center for isolation of nucleic acids. The quality-controlled nucleic acid samples are sent to the Genome Characterization Centers for whole exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing, and RNA-sequencing. Raw sequencing data is submitted to the Genomic Data Commons. CMDC-validated models and their case-associated genomic and clinical data are provided to the research community when available. More information about each component of the flowchart: The clinical data is submitted to the CDC at Information Management Services Inc. The CDC collects and quality controls the clinical data to confirm patient privacy is protected and to certify that the submitted clinical data conforms to the controlled vocabulary of the case report forms. As part of the clinical data submission process to Genomic Data Commons (GDC), the CDC maps the clinical data to the GDC data dictionary so that users can search and filter by specific clinical data. Tissue samples from patients and derived cancer models are sent to the BPC at Nationwide Children's Hospital. DNA is isolated from normal tissue, parent tumor, and the derived model while RNA is isolated from the parent tumor and derived model using standardized protocols. Internal BPC quality control and genotyping ensure quality and consistency of material for molecular characterization. The BPC submits biospecimen data to GDC and sends isolated nucleic acids to the Genomic Characterization Centers (GCCs) for molecular characterization. The isolated nucleic acids are sent to the GCCs for molecular characterization. Broad Institute: 15x whole genome sequencing and 150x whole exome sequencing are performed on DNA from normal tissue, parent tumor (when available), and derived model. Infinium MethylationEPIC DNA Array is performed on DNA from the derived model and a subset of tumors.  The University of North Carolina: 120 million read RNA sequencing is performed on RNA from the parent tumor and the derived model.  NCI's GDC houses all the clinical, biospecimen, and molecular characterization data. The GDC performs quality control and harmonizes the sequencing data through their analytical pipeline. Harmonized data are available at the GDC Data Portal. All data is made available using National Institutes of Health policies that protect patient privacy and confidentiality. The models are broadly available through a single third-party distributor, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). ATCC expands, preserves, quality checks, and globally distributes the models. ATCC provides standard operating procedures, images, and other model-specific culture information to the research community.

d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  2016  NCI opens online platform to submit ideas about research for Cancer Moonshot   News Releases   Posted:
April 18, 2016  240-760-6600 The National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health has launched an online platform to enable the research community and the public to submit ideas on the National Cancer Moonshot efforts. Submissions will be considered by the Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) of scientific experts and patient advocates as they develop the scientific direction at NCI for the initiative. The announcement of this online platform coincides with the opening of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in New Orleans. Ideas for advancing progress against cancer may be submitted at CancerResearchIdeas.cancer.gov. The Blue Ribbon Panel, whose members were announced on April 4 and which held its first meeting on April 11, will serve as a working group of the presidentially appointed National Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB). One of the first actions of the panel was to discuss the establishment of several proposed working groups to focus on specific topic areas. Ideas, which may range from cancer prevention to advancing understanding of the origins of cancer to reducing cancer health disparities, may be submitted in the following areas: Cancer clinical trials  Data sharing  Dissemination and population sciences  Immunotherapy, combination therapy, and immunoprevention  Pediatric cancer  Tumor evolution and progression  Other exceptional opportunities  The ideas that are submitted will be discussed and considered by the proposed working groups and the Blue Ribbon Panel as they deliberate about cancer research priorities and opportunities over the next few months. The panel will report its findings to the NCAB later this summer. “The goal of the Moonshot Initiative is to accelerate progress in the fight against cancer by swiftly advancing knowledge from cutting-edge basic research to new prevention and treatment strategies for patients,” said NCI Acting Director Douglas Lowy, M.D. “The community involvement that the initiative garners will allow us to consider novel, creative ideas that might not otherwise have come to NCI’s attention.” The feedback platform is just one way in which the public can provide ideas for accelerating progress in the fight against cancer through this initiative. Ideas can also be submitted by email (cancerresearch@nih.gov) or by calling NCI’s Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER. To sign up for updates on the online platform and other aspects of the National Cancer Moonshot Initiative, please visit the initiative’s main website (www.cancer.gov/moonshot-cancer-initiative). Vice President Biden's Moonshot: A Call for Cancer Research Ideas NCI Acting Director Doug Lowy, M.D., speaks to the importance of community input for the success of the Cancer Moonshot.

Hello, and welcome to Inside Cancer Careers, a podcast from the National Cancer Institute, where we explore all the different ways people fight cancer and hear their stories. I'm your host, Oliver Bogler, from NCI's Center for Cancer Training. There's ample evidence in the history of science that connecting across fields can stimulate innovation and produce advances. One fruitful connection has been between biology and the physical sciences and engineering. And today we are talking to two leaders at NIH involved in this work. Listen through to the end of the show to hear our guests make some interesting recommendations and where we invite you to take your turn. With us is Dr. Jennifer Couch, Chief of the Biophysics, Bioengineering, and Computational Sciences Branch in the Division of Cancer Biology at NCI. Welcome. Jennifer Couch
Hi Oliver, thanks for inviting me. Oliver Bogler
I'd also like to welcome Dr. Manu Platt, Director of the Biomedical Engineering Technology Acceleration or BETA Center at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering. Welcome. Manu Platt
Great to be here with you. Oliver Bogler
Let me start with the question of why and how different disciplines in STEMM can be brought together to accelerate progress. Jennifer, what are the strategies and goals of your branch and how do you accomplish them? Jennifer Couch 
Well, I think, you know, one of the key things about cancer is that it's complicated, it's multi -scale, it's impacted in many different ways and it has impacts on the body at many different levels. And so for that reason, I think cancer researchers are often adopters of new technologies and collaborate broadly. And we've seen over the past, you know, many decades that bringing physical sciences approaches and tools and  thinking into the cancer research space can really enhance the way that we address and develop ways to understand the basic mechanisms that underlie cancer initiation and progression and the way that it responds to therapies. Oliver Bogler
So one of the programs in your branch is called the Physical Sciences Oncology Network, or PSON, I think people call it. Tell us about that. Jennifer Couch
Yup. Oliver Bogler
What does it do? Jennifer Couch
So the Physical Sciences and Oncology Network has been around for about 15 years now, and it brings together explicitly partnerships between physical scientists, people with physical sciences expertise, and cancer research to address a broad range of cancer research questions, challenging things like spatial temporal dynamics and multi -scale effects of cancer, thinking about it through a physical sciences lens. And so all of the projects are collaborations between cancer researchers and people with these other expertise areas. Oliver Bogler
Have you got some examples for us of what kind of physical sciences are brought together with what kinds of biology to try and work together on the cancer problem? Jennifer Couch
Sure. So, we know a lot about the way that cancer develops and, and progresses at the molecular level. But one of the things that's been a real challenge is understanding the kind of mechanical forces involved in the way that cancer both initiates and progresses throughout the body and, um, when it metastasizes and whether or not those metastases survive in the new environment. And a lot of that has to do with the interplay between mechanical forces and molecular signaling. And so physical sciences have been key to both mathematically and computational and modeling those processes, but also developing the tools that we need to actually measure things like stiffness and fluid flow and adhesion strength and under different conditions, really designing the systems that we need to test out those hypotheses. Oliver Bogler
So the scientists you're bringing together probably have somewhat different languages, scientific languages, I mean. They have maybe slightly different mental models of how things work, right? I mean, I grew up in a very reductionist and deterministic age of biology that is slowly fading away into, you know, to be replaced by a more systems level and chaotic view of how it works. How does that manifest itself in the work that these different groups of scientists do together? Jennifer Couch
Yeah, you know, collaboration is really the key. And I think you said something critical here, which is that we're moving away in cancer biology, I think, from that reductionist view into thinking about a more integrated systems kind of approach. Again, this multi-scale phenomenon, the way that different scales impact emergent properties, all of those things. And when people trained in the physical sciences and engineering come together with cancer researchers, the way that they speak about a problem is often different in the way that they think about approaching it and the timeline, right? So for example, biology can be expensive. Doing experiments isn't trivial to do over and over again in the way that perhaps a physicist or a statistician might want. And so often they have to spend some time sort of understanding each other's, not just language and jargon, but approach to answering a question. But when they do that, when they walk… when they go through those, that difficult, conversation with each other they can really approach a problem in a way that they can't do separately. Oliver Bogler
And just for the sake of our audience, Jennifer, your branch is what we call extramural, right? So it works primarily by funding research that goes on outside the NCI, outside the NIH, across the country, right? Jennifer Couch
Yeah, and in fact entirely. So we support fundamental technology development and resource development that develops the tools and the approaches and the methods that cancer researchers will then adopt and use to answer research questions. And that's done almost entirely through extramural research grants through a variety of different mechanisms. The physical sciences program that you mentioned is one critical program, but we get a lot of our projects through what we call investigator-initiated research. That's just the standard way that NIH solicits and supports research. Oliver Bogler
That's when a research team out in the community has a good idea and they put in a grant just of their own accord to compete for funding, right? Jennifer Couch
Yeah, and I would say, you know, for teams like this that where physical scientists and biologists might be coming together, that's particularly challenging to sort of think about how peer review will handle those projects and how to think about sort of selling it, if you will, right, to a group of your peers that might be a combined group of physicists and biologists. And so talking to one of us in my branch or across the NIH is always a good idea ahead of time, just to get a sense of how peer review might react to a different project and of a different scope and that sort of thing, or whether we might have a specific funding opportunity that suits the project that they're considering. Oliver Bogler
Dr. Platt, Manu, you're leading a new initiative at the NIBIB, which has a role across the NIH, the BETA Center. What is that all about? Please tell us. Manu Platt
Great question. No, so we are an NIH-wide center. We're housed in NIBIB. And one thing that's great about my institute is we are disease agnostic, right? We help develop technology tools that can be used to cause health medicine and even basic research. So in that way, that's what allows us to reach out to investigators all across the NIH. And I'm in the Intramural Research Program. I have a research lab here that I moved here last year, about a year ago now. And so what we are doing is first finding the engineers and biomedical engineers that are in all of the other institutes because they're out there helping to bring them together to build communities, but also so that we can share the tools that we are using, the principles that we're applying so that bring in other clinicians and basic science researchers into kind of lowering those barriers so they can use the tools as well. Oliver Bogler
So you mentioned that you're in the intramural program. That is the program that lives within the NIH. Each of our institutes and centers, or the majority of them, have their own research teams. Some people say that the kind of research that the intramural program does has some distinctions from what is more common extramurally because of the way it's funded. Sometimes people say it's more long-term, some projects are more higher risk. Is that your experience? Manu Platt
So I've been here one year, so I can't speak on the long-term piece. But a big draw for me to come to the NIH from an academic lab was the idea that we could do more higher risk research without having to get it approved through the review committee that I you just mentioned with Jennifer. Because big ideas, I study disease that cut across lots of methods and organ systems. And to be able to then be able to test those diseases here is quite fantastic. What I also think is the other big drawback for all the people in the outside world to think about is the Clinical Center here. You know, it's stocked with clinicians that are willing and eager to work on the cutting edge. And so they're willing to look at the rare diseases or the rare complications and talk to those of us on the research side who also don't have answers. I think that puts it in a really unique or a rarefied air to ask some really difficult questions. Oliver Bogler
So the BETA center will be assembling teams. I understand that correctly? Manu Platt
We're letting groups self-assemble and self-organize. We are bringing people together so they can hear what are the latest, greatest that's happening, what do we have access to on campus that people may not have been aware about that's in another institute. And so through that way, we're building teams across research institutes that then can push in different directions. Or bring more people into pushing in the same direction, but you bring your clinical buzz, you bring your clinical samples, or you bring your particular molecule of interest that we can help you probe in the physical ways, mechanical ways, and optical ways that may not be appreciated. Oliver Bogler
So you're both kind of in the business of forming these transdisciplinary teams. And I wonder, what are the secret ingredients? What's the recipe that you use, Manu, to bring those teams together and have them work together effectively? Manu Platt
Well, this is a simple thing that's true about human nature. It works at NIH just like it works in the extramural world. Food. Right? You can have people come together around food. But also, I think we are all nerds, right? I think once you are in higher science and you're pursuing a research career, the nerd part of you cannot be denied. And so when you are showing people there are new things that are happening in science that you may not have heard about, people become interested. And also, one of our characters also, we want to lower barriers of resistance for you to come along and try something new to kind of, again, de-risk it. Hey, you read something in that paper that had this amazing engineering technology that you don't know anybody around you that does. Well, come and talk to us. We may know people that do it on campus or with some of the shared resources here, they may be able to help build it so that you and your lab can now bring this technology back home. Again, opening up new doors and then tell all your friends about, oh, I'm doing this new thing. You should go and check them out. They're really able to work with you and be helpful and they were actually right next door all this time. Oliver Bogler
Yeah, I think that's a common thing, right? The people you don't know are not far away physically. They're just not in your daily routine. And so it's hard to do that. Jennifer, any insights from your side? What's the secret sauce? Jennifer Couch
Yeah, I think that is the secret sauce, that we're all curious people. And, you know, the real secret is sort of patience and an ability to be willing to admit that there's things that you don't know and to listen to other people's description of those from a very different perspective and kind of struggle through that initial conversation. That struggle yields real rewards in the end. And I would say sometimes those people are right next door and sometimes they aren't. And so we have in the past developed some programs that we call things like innovations labs or ideas labs that specifically bring together people from very, very different fields to form those kinds of collaborations to start to build out their networks. It's another thing that we do with our junior investigators meetings is try and sort of create those larger networks for people. Cause I think it can be difficult to step into a wonderful multidisciplinary space when you don't know where you're stepping. Manu Platt
I’ve done one of those innovations labs and they are fantastic. So I just want to put in a plug if anyone gets an invite or sees an advertisement for one of those NCI innovation labs. I learned a lot in the one I was participating in and I hope that I also gave a lot to it as well. It was fantastic experience. Oliver Bogler
That's a great tip also for our listeners. Manu, so you just mentioned you have been here almost a year. The Center is a year old. What are some of the early goals that you pursued and what are some of the things you feel you've already accomplished? Manu Platt
Oh yeah, so it's been a great year, a lot of doing new things, but a big goal. The biggest one is getting a group of people. So far we have over 85 investigators across 16 different institutes and centers here at NIH that are affiliated with the BETA Center and have become regular attendees of, we have these research meet and greets where people give rapid fires to talk about what they do. And so that's been huge. And we're also now funding some summer students through the BETA Center and NIBIB that will work again in other institutes and labs here, because as bioengineers, we're still bringing in people from other disciplines to do bioengineering work because we are, again, as a field, are multidisciplinary. And so that openness that I've seen and the willingness to participate and be involved has been really exciting and refreshing. And so that's been a big win for this first season. Again, the other part is learning the administrative rules and regs here at NIH. And that there are ways that you can still cross institutes and that can flow smoothly. And then ways that are not so smooth, but that we are able to actually get lower those barriers to make it easier for people to come together. Oliver Bogler
You mentioned outreach and workforce development. That's another component of the BETA center, right? And of course of NIH overall. So tell me, what are your goals in that domain? Manu Platt
Right. So great opportunity here. We're federally funded, U.S. government, which is fantastic. And for those that don't know, I'm actually, I'm African-American. And so as an African-American professor in the university world, about 2 % of professors were African-American in science and engineering. At NIH, it's a little lower. I didn't know it would go lower, but it is for the, at the investigator level. And so there's room for improvement in growth. I'm trying to help again, break down the barriers and myths. I think a lot of investigators in the extramural world aren't aware of the rich opportunity that are available in the intramural campus, right? So helping to bring in postdocs who may be done an engineering PhD out in the world, you should come to this campus and actually see how close you can interface with clinicians because maybe you didn't think that's what a federal lab resource is able to do, but we are. So again, in my work about outreach, it's about changing people's perceptions of what's happening here and let you come to campus, but also helping investigators on campus recruit from the outside world to find the type of talent that they want. And we all know this, the most creative solutions come from the most diverse teams. And so really helping people to access people from different backgrounds, research disciplines, and so they can see that fruit kind of blossom here. Oliver Bogler
Great, thanks very much. Okay, let's take a quick break and when we come back, we'll talk to our guests about their own career paths and what wisdom they have picked up along the way. [music starts] Oliver Bogler
PubMed lists over 270,000 cancer papers published in 2022 – that is a staggering 750 papers every day. It’s great that cancer research is such an active field, but it makes finding the pubs that are critical to your work a challenge. What if you had an AI that paid attention to the papers you read and suggested others as they appear in PubMed? That is exactly what the NCI is building with an app called NanCI. With me to discuss NanCI are two members of the team that are creating NanCI. Duncan Anderson 
NanCI  is an app for cancer scientists and it helps them to discover the research in new ways and connect with each other and build their personal networks and share information and get to know each other. We've just launched the ability to actually chat with a piece of research, so you can actually have a conversation and ask questions about a research paper itself. JD Wuarin
Instead of having to read the whole paper yourself, you can now simply ask questions and NanCI will answer those questions. One of the cool features we've also added is that it will read the abstract and figure out what questions you might want to ask the paper. Duncan Anderson
We're using artificial intelligence within NanCI to help to make information easier to find and easier to understand and easier to interact with. The only information we're using is the scientific data. So the research paper, for example, we don't allow our AI to go off and answer random questions that might introduce all sorts of concerns. JD Wuarin
And so the idea will be that eventually with NanCI straight from your pocket, you'll not only be able to chat with papers and understand what papers are about, but also based on your interest, it will suggest to you what you might want to investigate, maybe which gene mutation you might want to look at, which new disease might be related to what you're doing. And that's gonna be interesting, I think. Duncan Anderson
If you start working in a field which you don't have a lot of experience in, it can be a bit daunting. There's a lot of information to read. We have this idea that you could tell NanCI what the field is and NanCI would go off and present you the key influential papers in that space so you can very quickly get your head around what this new field is. So today, NanCI can be used by cancer researchers in the USA. So it's available from the Apple App Store for the iPhone. And there's a restriction on the downloads, which means that you need to have an email address associated with a cancer research institution. [music ends] Oliver Bogler
And we're back. Let me start with you, Dr. Platt. Manu, what first got you interested in science and engineering? Manu Platt
So funny story, so my mother, she retired in 2012, but my mother is a health and physical education teacher. Okay, so she is a very fit woman and was always talking about your body and do this for your body and drink the water in your body. And so that was nice to hear her say, but then how does it actually work used to really always interest me. So that's where the bio side came from. Then for the engineering, my dad was in the Air Force, so he did 20 years in the Air Force, moved around a bit. But he retired in Dover, Delaware. And there in Dover, Delaware is Delaware State University, Delaware State College at the time, but it's a Historically Black College and University. And they had this program there, it was a Saturday academy for middle school students and then in high school, you could say on campus, called FAME, Forum to Advance Minorities in Engineering. And so we would go every other Saturday and they'd do math and science and talk about engineering. And I was like, I don't know what this is, but it's about thinking about how things work. And I love the health and phys ed that I was getting from my mom and those interests together were the tools that then said you can use engineering to understand how our bodies are working. Because again, physical education teaches a lot of impact, movement, motion, and how your bodies change when you do these things. And that was the spark that kind of, when I heard about biomedical, I'll tell you this story, one more story. Also in my textbook, in my AP biology class, the textbooks used to have those career highlights in them, remember? It's quite useful. And one day there was a career highlight on medical technologists. And I was like, whoa, medicine and technology, these are the things that I'm really interested in. And my friend sitting next to me said, you know, that looks like something my aunt does. She's like a biomedical engineer or something. And I said, that's it. Because I was doing FAME, I love biology. That sounds amazing. And I've been on the path ever since. Oliver Bogler
That's fantastic. Jennifer, how about you? Jennifer Couch
Well, I'm a fair bit older than Manu. So I stumbled into this world, you know, down a bit of a rocky path. So I came to the world of cancer biology via molecular evolution and sort of the early years of genomics and the genome project. And so that idea of kind of doing things at a large scale and thinking about things as a system and thinking about cancer as an evolving system or system of systems was really appealing to me intellectually. And then coming to the extramural space where I can work with smart people who are putting their brains towards solving real cancer research questions just felt important. And so that's what drew me to this space. I like to think about the bigger picture and I'm really keen to help the extramural research community get us there. Oliver Bogler
That's great. I still want to know what made you want to become a scientist in the first place. Jennifer Couch
Oh, gosh, I don't know. I think, all right, I'm gonna go back to something else Manu said, he said curious nerd. And I think that is what I have always been. You know, I come from a long range of curious nerds. My grandmother was a woman who was deeply curious and knew everything about every weed and every plant out in the forest and that sort of thing. And she had a sixth grade education, but she was one of the smartest people I ever knew. And her son, my father, was sort of also that way. And so I just sort of grew up in that environment where we're allowed to be curious about everything. Oliver Bogler
So Manu, let's pick it up for you. So you heard about this idea of biomedical engineering when you were in high school or thereabouts. So where did you go next? Manu Platt
Right, so applying to colleges, leaving Dover Delaware and I have this, I'll try to tell the shorter version, but I have this award from my high school. It was the RPI Medal, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute medal for the top science student of your junior year. And so senior year, they had us come up to the RPI to get this medal and award. And it's in Troy, New York, which they told us how cold it would get. But they began to talk about undergraduate research and that that's what they wanted undergraduates to do. And I was like, oh my goodness, we could actually start like touching and doing things with human stuff. But then in their program book, but they actually had these dual degree engineering program. And one of the schools they had a partnership with was Morehouse College, which is a Historically Black College all male in Atlanta, Georgia. And growing up when I did in the 80s, 90s, we all knew about Morehouse and heard about Morehouse and Spelman. And I was like, oh my goodness, I could go both. So then when I finally toured Morehouse in Atlanta, spring break of my senior year, I mean, I had to go just to be on that campus with all Black men. And again, growing up a child in the nineties, there were different impressions of Black men in the nineties. And it was just very reinforcing to be there where what that allowed was being a Black man, like wasn't what your daily experience was. You could find all these other things that you are because everybody here is a Black man. And there were scientists and engineers and biologists. That was my professor who had been out in the world and making sure we got the science part. So then what happens, I got a NASA scholarship when I was at Morehouse and I was on this dual degree engineering path thinking I would go to RPI, went to do these NASA internships as well with the scholarship. And so seeing how mechanical forces influence biology, when astronauts go to space, they have all of these other physiological complications, was really just mind blowing because in biology, I think we learn what happens, but I think the engineering and the mechanical aspects tell us why they happen. And that our biology obey all the same physical principles. It was amazing to me. So I was all in and that NASA experiences, several of them, maybe decided when to get a PhD in biomedical engineering so that I could stay on this research path. Medicine was not for me and I have been happy and excited and all the things the nerds ever said. Oliver Bogler 
So you did your PhD at Georgia Tech, right? And then you did a postdoc at MIT in biological engineering as well. And then you went to the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory for your faculty work. Manu Platt
I did. Yes. So I was the hometown boy right now. Once I moved to Atlanta, I couldn't leave. And so right in my PhD, I worked on mechanical forces more in a cardiovascular space, but at the root were these enzymes, these proteases that remodel tissue. And I still study them today. Then during my postdoc, I switched over to orthopedic tissue engineering, biomaterials and systems biology. And I was in a lab where we're applying systems biology to cancer and other spaces. And again, as Jennifer mentioned, cancer is, it's such a complicated problem. And when you first start thinking about cancer, it’s one cell that goes wrong but it's so much more than that. And using mathematical and computational biology to help understand things that we can't directly test for, at least currently, also added another set of tools where computational biology and math with biology is another way of opening up doors to help solve these problems. And again, those things don't mix, I think earlier in your educational career for some reason, maybe things that we could change. But when you start hearing about them, I was resistant and I fought a few of my professors at first until the idea that we could save one experiment by using math to predict what the biology would do. Okay, now you've made it practical. Now let's talk about it. And so I went to do a postdoc to really get computational modeling and system biology experience so that when I started my own group back at Georgia Tech, I could be all of these things that make me this unique person. And the proteases that I started with cardiovascular, they are highly active in cancer and they play a lot of functional roles, but also they become biomarkers for when thinking about diagnosis, prognosis, and so we push in those directions. Oliver Bogler
So I want to pick up on something you just said, which intrigues me. And also because the two of you, you took very different paths into your current roles, right? Manu, you kind of went what might be now described as a well-established bioengineering pathway, right? That sort of, for you, bio and engineering was almost always there. And for Jennifer, it sort of came a little bit more circuitously. So are we preparing the next generation of cancer biologists? Because I only care about cancer. No, a biomedical scientist, let's be more general here. Are we preparing them well or should they be exposed to more of a mixture? Like you said, Manu, that you don't always get that mixture early on. Manu Platt
I think yes. My undergrad degree was straight biology and then I switched to biomedical engineering. And I enjoyed having a hardcore biology education that then when I got to grad school hearing the engineering ways that apply because I think it's… oh, you're going to get me in trouble with my engineering colleagues, you're going to get me in trouble. I think what I have heard and I think there's a general stereotype, is that engineering is hard, biology is easy, right? You just have to learn things in biology. But engineering has math and it's hard. But I think that's not true. I think there, what engineering has done, it relies on physics and chemistry and math, but they've established laws and principles and rules that we know work, right? Biology, we don't have equations for everything that happens. And as cells are living, they change. With cancer, not every cell changes the same, even within the same tumor. And so the rules aren't so established. But I think what biologists are trained as we raise, you know, we learn about evolution, ecology, how things work in different ways. If you're not raised in that, I've met engineers who say, if I tell a cell to do this, it's going to do this. And because I told it to. And you're like, that cell… Oliver Bogler
Good luck. Manu Platt
Right. It might start doing it and then it's going to try to get back to homeostasis and do 15 other things that you can't even measure to get to where it needs to be and there's your disease and the complications. So that's why I think let the experts teach it and then have a few integrative classes that help cross those bridges. And there can be a strength in having the person forge from their own views how both worlds kind of can make. I think that was my graduate education, which biologists were taught alongside traditional engineers and then we as students collaborated with each other to help each other understand what was going on. And I think that was stronger than a fully integrative approach throughout the entire education. But that's me, I'm one person. Clearly I love my program. I went back and started my lab there. So that's my long answer to that question. Oliver Bogler
Thank you. Jennifer, what's your perspective on that? Are we teaching people in undergraduate even the right way? Jennifer Couch
You know, I suspect we are teaching them in a variety of different ways. And I think Manu and I both sort of show that you can come at this problem in a very different, through a very different route. You know, the time at which I was taught biology and things, I think they were even more separate. And we were taught things in a distinct order and they didn't sort of necessarily integrate. I agree with you Manu that sometimes when people teach things like as is, completely integrated, people lose the beauty of individual fields and the views that you can take. As you said, for example, sometimes when the biologists collaborate with engineers and physicists and things that mathematicians, right, the first year or so is highly frustrating because those mathematicians want, they want the data they want. And the biologist says, well, you know, I can't get that. We can't measure that. I can't do that. It can't happen. Or I'll measure it, but you know, you're not going to believe the data that comes out of it because biology changes and things happen. And those that that struggle is, is difficult. But I think maybe going back even earlier in education, I would love us to educate people much earlier that they can pursue a variety of different careers and that biomedical research isn't all about becoming a medical doctor and understanding how to deal with patients. There is a lot that you can contribute if you are very analytical person, if you're a very logical person, if you're the kind of person that builds teams really well, or you're the kind of person that is the translator between different fields, all those people are really critical in the biomedical research enterprise across the whole spectrum from basic biology to translational research and population science. And I just think the more different voices and lived experiences and perspectives that we have coming at difficult problems like cancer, the the more progress we'll make. Oliver Bogler
So thank you. That's a perfect segue into my last question, which is what advice do you have for people listening who might be, you know, they might be in high school or even or undergraduates or even in graduate school, they might already be on a science path. But what advice do you have for them in terms of your both of your experiences of sort of combining different areas to bring to bring new ideas together? Jennifer, what would you say? Jennifer Couch 
I think, you know, it is difficult and just giving yourself the patience and, you know, the fortitude to sort of stick with it and take criticism for what it is. It is just suggestions on making your work better and take advice for what it is and try and build out that network of peers that will support you and work with you and help you build your work forward and will give you critical advice when you need it. Oliver Bogler
Manu, what do you say to the young scientists in your team? Manu Platt
I love talking to young scientists. I love the Tim Cook line, right, about bring your whole self to work. And so when I talk to young scientists, I want to remind them you can be exactly who you are and be a scientist. You can look any kind of way, come from whatever kind of background and be a scientist. You do not have to look like what you've seen in textbooks or TV or whatever how a scientist or an engineer looks. Because I think that can make a lot of people think, I would never want to be that, quote, lame, so I don't want to do that. But that's just a stereotype. But I think that's important because every experience that you have, even while you're even at, before you start learning about science or before you're even when you're not in classes, help you view the world and questions and problems in a unique way that the person next to you will not view it, even if you all took the same classes forever. And your ideas matter. Right? And from your perspective, your ideas matter. And so I go back to Jennifer about building good teams. When you're on these teams and you look different than everyone in the room, put your idea out there on the table because I promise you they have not thought of it. And that idea that you have could be what saves the day. Right? So that's why we need people from all these backgrounds and who look all kinds of ways to come to that table and you belong. Oliver Bogler
Thank you both. That's fantastic advice and really appreciate you spending some time with us. [music] Oliver Bogler
Now it's time for a segment we call Your Turn because it's a chance for our listeners to send in a recommendation that they would like to share. If you're listening, then you're invited to take your turn. Send us a tip for a book, a video, a podcast or a talk that you found inspirational, amusing or interesting. You can send these to us at nciicc@nih.gov. If you record a voice memo and send it along, we may just play it in an upcoming episode. Now I'd like to invite our guests to take their turn. Let's start with you, Jennifer. Jennifer Couch
Well, I know one of the things that people are really excited about and really worried about and really struggling with is artificial intelligence. And so the National Cancer Institute is running a series of what we're calling AI Conversations, right, designed to get at topics in AI where there's maybe there's not consensus yet. There's sort of emerging discussions to be had. And so those occur bi-monthly and I can put a link wherever it is that I put links. Oliver Bogler
We'll put the link in the show notes for you. Jennifer Couch
Thank you. Oliver Bogler
That's a great recommendation. I'm personally very excited about AI, but also anxious. So I do try to listen into those conversations. Manu, what kind of recommendation do you have for us? Manu Platt
Yes, I have two quick reads. One kind of goes with one of the things that the topic Jennifer and I have been talking about. And it's written by Martin A. Schwartz. But it's called The Importance of Stupidity in Scientific Research. And if you meet Martin, he's a highly accomplished but also very cerebral scientist. And he stresses here that the more comfortable we become with being stupid, the deeper we will wade into the unknown and more likely we are to make big discoveries. I think young scientists get afraid of being wrong, but that's not where you want to be. You don't want to be where everything I do is right because you're not at the edge of knowledge. So check that out. But the other one that's more personal is it's a time management piece that, you know, when I was a first, second year professor, time was just crazy. And a lot of people I know struggled with time management, particularly in these times where you can zoom and triple book yourself. But it's this piece that I reread and I share with my trainees. It's called Do It Now by this gentleman, Steve Pavlina. It's a 13-page read, so if you don't have time to read it, the time management is really screwed up. But it really talks about this person. He graduated from college in three semesters. Not three years, semesters. But he talked about all the different ways he had to manage his time in order to do that. And it turns the way you think about time management kind of on its head and challenges some of the ways that we normally function. And maybe those things are actually not the best use for us. So I challenge people to read it, run the experiments yourself and see what works. I have to reread it myself about every two months because I slip in the old habits. But there's some other things that have stuck good and really helped me out in the long run. So do it now. Steve Pavlina. Oliver Bogler
Yeah, I'm going to go check that out. It's maybe it's not too late for me. Manu Platt
Never too late. Oliver Bogler
Great, thanks. I'd like to make a recommendation as well. It's for a book from a while ago. It's called The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins. It was first published in 1976, and I came across it as a schoolboy in the 1980s. And it's a significant part of why I wanted to become a biologist. He uses very strong anthropomorphic concepts and looks at biology and evolution at the level of the gene, exploring the idea that an organism is just a way for a gene to get itself into the next generation with as many copies as possible. It actually makes for fascinating reading. And it was criticized at times for being very anthropomorphic, for ascribing these human motivations to a gene. However, he acknowledges that that is just a tool. And my interest in the book has recently been rekindled by reading the works of Dr. Itai Yanai and Dr. Martin Lercher whose exploration of night science was in part inspired by the works of Prof Dawkins. If you haven't read The Selfish Gene, it's a classic. I recommended it, if only because of its importance in science and culture and the history of biology and evolution. And, spoiler alert, the last chapter talks about memes and how they propagate. So he saw that long before we had social media. Take a look.

Time to End Cancer as We Know It


Stories   Time to End Cancer as We Know It  Stories  Imagine a world where cancer doesn’t significantly impact someone’s life. Thanks to a golden age of research, that reality is on the horizon. In the last 50 years, our understanding of this disease has grown and we’ve made great strides—from our ability to predict and intercept cancer through improved prevention, screenings, and early detection, to the creation of new therapies and more effective treatments. These efforts are paying off, as we’ve seen a substantial reduction in the number of people dying of cancer in the last 25 years alone. There's more work to do, but we won’t stop until we ensure progress across all cancers and for all people. Nothing Will Stop Us We're committed to ending cancer as we know it and nothing will stop us from achieving this goal.

Do cigars cause cancer and other diseases? What if I don’t inhale the cigar smoke? Are cigars addictive? Are cigars less hazardous than cigarettes? Do nicotine replacement products help cigar smokers to quit? How can I get help quitting smoking? How are cigars different from cigarettes? Cigarettes usually differ from cigars in size and in the type of tobacco used (1–3). Moreover, in contrast with cigarette smoke, cigar smoke is often not inhaled. The main features of these tobacco products are: Cigarettes: Cigarettes are uniform in size and contain less than 1 gram of tobacco each. U.S. cigarettes are made from different blends of tobaccos, which are never fermented, and they are wrapped with paper. Most U.S. cigarettes take less than 10 minutes to smoke.  Cigars: Most cigars are composed primarily of a single type of tobacco (air-cured and fermented), and they have a tobacco wrapper. They can vary in size and shape and contain between 1 gram and 20 grams of tobacco. Three cigar sizes are sold in the United States:

Large cigars can measure more than 7 inches in length, and they typically contain between 5 and 20 grams of tobacco. Some premium cigars contain the tobacco equivalent of an entire pack of cigarettes. Large cigars can take between 1 and 2 hours to smoke.


Cigarillos are a type of smaller cigar. They are a little bigger than little cigars and cigarettes and contain about 3 grams of tobacco.


Little cigars are the same size and shape as cigarettes, are often packaged like cigarettes (20 little cigars in a package), and contain about 1 gram of tobacco. Also, unlike large cigars, some little cigars have a filter, which makes it seem they are designed to be smoked like cigarettes (that is, for the smoke to be inhaled).  Cigarettes: Cigarettes are uniform in size and contain less than 1 gram of tobacco each.

Also, unlike large cigars, some little cigars have a filter, which makes it seem they are designed to be smoked like cigarettes (that is, for the smoke to be inhaled). Are there harmful chemicals in cigar smoke? Yes. Cigar smoke, like cigarette smoke, contains toxic and cancer-causing chemicals that are harmful to both smokers and nonsmokers. Cigar smoke is possibly more toxic than cigarette smoke (3). Cigar smoke has: A higher level of cancer-causing substances: During the fermentation process for cigar tobacco, high concentrations of cancer-causing nitrosamines are produced. These compounds are released when a cigar is smoked. Nitrosamines are found at higher levels in cigar smoke than in cigarette smoke.  More tar: For every gram of tobacco smoked, there is more cancer-causing tar in cigars than in cigarettes.  A higher level of toxins: Cigar wrappers are less porous than cigarette wrappers. The nonporous cigar wrapper makes the burning of cigar tobacco less complete than the burning of cigarette tobacco. As a result, cigar smoke has higher concentrations of toxins than cigarette smoke.  A higher level of cancer-causing substances: During the fermentation process for cigar tobacco, high concentrations of cancer-causing nitrosamines are produced. These compounds are released when a cigar is smoked. Nitrosamines are found at higher levels in cigar smoke than in cigarette smoke. More tar: For every gram of tobacco smoked, there is more cancer-causing tar in cigars than in cigarettes. A higher level of toxins: Cigar wrappers are less porous than cigarette wrappers. The nonporous cigar wrapper makes the burning of cigar tobacco less complete than the burning of cigarette tobacco. As a result, cigar smoke has higher concentrations of toxins than cigarette smoke. Furthermore, the larger size of most cigars (more tobacco) and longer smoking time result in higher exposure to many toxic substances (including carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, ammonia, cadmium, and other substances). Cigar smoke can be a major source of indoor air pollution (1). There is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke. If you want to reduce the health risk to yourself and others, stop smoking. Do cigars cause cancer and other diseases? Yes. Cigar smoking causes cancer of the oral cavity, larynx, esophagus, and lung. It may also cause cancer of the pancreas. Moreover, daily cigar smokers, particularly those who inhale, are at increased risk for developing heart disease and other types of lung disease. Regular cigar smokers and cigarette smokers have similar levels of risk for oral cavity and esophageal cancers. The more you smoke, the greater the risk of disease (3). What if I don’t inhale the cigar smoke? Unlike nearly all cigarette smokers, most cigar smokers do not inhale. Although cigar smokers have lower rates of lung cancer, coronary heart disease, and lung disease than cigarette smokers, they have higher rates of these diseases than those who do not smoke cigars. All cigar and cigarette smokers, whether or not they inhale, directly expose their lips, mouth, tongue, throat, and larynx to smoke and its toxic and cancer-causing chemicals. In addition, when saliva containing the chemicals in tobacco smoke is swallowed, the esophagus is exposed to carcinogens. These exposures probably account for the similar oral and esophageal cancer risks seen among cigar smokers and cigarette smokers (3). Are cigars addictive? Yes. Even if the smoke is not inhaled, high levels of nicotine (the chemical that causes addiction) can still be absorbed into the body. A cigar smoker can get nicotine by two routes: by inhalation into the lungs and by absorption through the lining of the mouth. Either way, the smoker becomes addicted to the nicotine that gets into the body. A single cigar can potentially provide as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes (1). Are cigars less hazardous than cigarettes? Because all tobacco products are harmful and cause cancer, the use of these products is strongly discouraged. There is no safe level of tobacco use. People who use any type of tobacco product should be encouraged to quit. For help with quitting, see the National Cancer Institute (NCI) fact sheet Where To Get Help When You Decide To Quit Smoking. Do nicotine replacement products help cigar smokers to quit? Nicotine replacement products, or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), deliver measured doses of nicotine into the body, which helps to relieve the cravings and withdrawal symptoms often felt by people trying to quit smoking. Strong and consistent evidence shows that NRT can help people quit smoking cigarettes (4). Limited research has been completed to determine the usefulness of NRT for people who smoke cigars. For help with quitting cigar smoking, ask your doctor or pharmacist about NRT, as well as about individual or group counseling, telephone quitlines, or other methods. How can I get help quitting smoking? NCI and other agencies and organizations can help smokers quit: Go online to Smokefree.gov, a website created by NCI’s Tobacco Control Research Branch, and use the Step-by-Step Quit Guide.  Call NCI’s Smoking Quitline at 1–877–448–7848 (1–877–44U–QUIT) for individualized counseling, printed information, and referrals to other sources.

Research   Types of Cancer Treatment  Side Effects of Cancer Treatment  A to Z List of Cancer Drugs  Complementary & Alternative Medicine (CAM)  Selected NCI-Supported Trials  Questions to Ask about Your Treatment  NIH Clinical Center  Research  The National Cancer Institute (NCI) embarked on the Exceptional Responders Initiative (ERI) to understand the molecular underpinnings of exceptional responses to treatment, primarily via chemotherapy, in cancer patients. Exceptional responders are patients who have a unique response to treatments that are not effective for most other patients. For this initiative, exceptional responders were identified among patients enrolled in early-phase clinical trials in which fewer than 10% of the patients responded to the treatments being studied; patients who were treated with drugs not found to be generally effective for their disease; patients who were treated in later-phase clinical trials of single agents or combinations; and even patients who were treated with established therapies. In this study, malignant tissue (and normal tissue, when possible) and clinical data were obtained from a group of exceptional responders for detailed analysis. The goal is to determine whether certain molecular features of the malignant tissue can predict responses to the same or similar drugs. The study also has an optional survey of complementary and alternative medicines, lifestyle changes, and additional medical conditions and their medications that may help to clarify the exceptional response. 2.  Can researchers and physicians submit cases for review or consideration? No. As of November 21, 2017, the Exceptional Responders study accrual goals have been met, and the study is now closed to accrual. Tissue samples from more than 100 cases have been received and molecular analysis is ongoing. 3.  What were the eligibility requirements for this study? Exceptional responders are patients who met the following criteria: Received a treatment in which fewer than 10% of patients had a complete response or a durable (lasting at least 6 months) partial response based on clinical trial data or extensive historical experience in the context of the patient’s tumor type  Achieved either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) with duration of at least 6 months as defined by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria for solid tumors or response criteria as defined where RECIST is not commonly used  Sustained a complete or partial response for at least three times longer than the median duration of response from literature resources for that treatment  Other requirements included: The patient, if still living, must have given appropriate consent for future research on their tumor tissue. If a patient is deceased, their tissue can be used for genomic analysis, unless a previous consent indicated their tissue could not be used for further research.  Available tumor tissue was collected prior to administration of the drug to which the exceptional response occurred. Ideally this would be just prior to treatment, but any prior tissue will be acceptable. The amount of tissue needs to be either a core biopsy or larger; fine needle aspirations will not provide enough tissue for analysis.  If available, blood or other biospecimens could undergo germline (non-cancerous) genomic sequencing to help clarify if molecular abnormalities seen in tumor are also seen in normal (germline) tissue.  Tumor treatment history, other than the drug to which the exceptional response occurred, will be collected if possible.  4.  To be eligible, did the patient need to be treated on a clinical trial? No. The Exceptional Responders study did not require that patients be treated on a clinical trial. If the patient was treated on a clinical trial, the overall percentage of patients who responded to the therapy should be 10% or less of all patients (e.g., less than 10% had a complete response, or less than 10% had a partial response lasting at least 6 months). The study also accepted cases from patients who were treated with any treatment (except local treatments like surgery and radiation therapy), but the case must have had a documented response to that treatment that would not be expected to occur in more than 10% of similarly treated patients (i.e., the same disease symptoms and the same drug). Because a response needed to be documented, adjuvant treatments were generally not applicable. 5.  Was an initial feasibility study conducted? As a proof of principle, experts in NCI’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) searched a database of phase 2 trials covering a period of 10 years (2002–2012) for cases that experienced exceptional responses. About 100 cases were identified to demonstrate that cases of the type needed for the ERI did exist, and in sufficient numbers to establish this initiative. Investigators believe that obtaining successful exome-sequencing results and deep targeted sequencing and mRNA sequencing, if possible, from about 100 cases will provide sufficient information about the likelihood of finding promising discoveries. The exome regions of the genome are the protein-coding regions. The sample size was based on 95% confidence intervals (i.e., the estimate is 95% reliable) for various measures of feasibility and success. The investigators have also allowed enough flexibility to add additional cases through other means as appropriate. The results are not expected to meet rigorous statistical standards but to indicate whether this line of investigation has promise. 6.  How will molecular testing be performed? DNA and RNA will be isolated from tissues submitted to the ERI and will undergo whole-exome sequencing and/or mRNA sequencing. Whole-exome sequencing is used to analyze the exons of thousands of genes simultaneously using advanced sequencing techniques. The exome comprises only 1% of the human genome, yet it houses as many as 85% of disease-related mutations. As a research tool, exome sequencing is a powerful way to investigate common and rare genetic variations that play a role in complex human diseases. Cases with sufficient nucleic acids will undergo additional analyses (e.g., deep targeted sequencing, microRNA sequencing, promoter methylation analysis, single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping and/or whole genome sequencing). Each case will be annotated with demographic and clinical information, along with sufficient follow-up information, to correlate molecular profiles with response. Both retrospective and prospective specimen collections will be considered. 7.  Was there a particular case that prompted this initiative? Yes. In the case that sparked this initiative, mutations in genes called TSC1 and NF2, which result in a loss of function (the genes are defective and don’t produce an active protein product), were detected in a patient with a form of bladder cancer. This person had a complete response that lasted more than 2 years in a clinical trial of everolimus, an agent targeting a molecular pathway that is regulated by the TSC1 and NF2 genes. Separately, investigators sequenced tumors from 96 other individuals with high-grade bladder cancer, and found five additional TSC1 gene mutations. They then sequenced tumors from 13 patients with bladder cancer who had received everolimus, and found that three of four patients with TSC1 gene mutations had some tumor shrinkage in response to receiving everolimus, whereas eight of nine patients whose tumor progressed did not have such a mutation. This example demonstrates how exceptional responders could help identify novel or known molecular abnormalities that are likely to be predictive of response to agents with targets in a relevant biological pathway. In subsequent workshops and discussions, it became obvious that all clinicians have seen a few exceptional responders. 8.  When will the molecular characterization data be available? Processing of the tissues to obtain nucleic acids will take place at the Biospecimen Core Resource facility and is expected to take approximately 30 days. Whole-exome sequence characterization at the Genome Sequencing and Characterization Center is expected to take 120 days. Thirty days after the relevant information is deposited in the data center, it will be made available through a controlled access mechanism. Controlled access will be provided via the database for Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). Investigators will be able to apply for access by submitting a Data Access Request to the Exceptional Responders Data Access Committee through the dbGAP. 9.  Where can I obtain more details about this initiative? The trial number is NCT02243592. More information is available in the protocol summary and from NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis.  Updated:

d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  Monica Bertagnolli begins work as 16th director of the National Cancer Institute   News Releases   Posted:
October 3, 2022  240-760-6600 Dr. Monica Bertagnolli Monica M. Bertagnolli, M.D., started today as the 16th director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). She is the first woman to hold the position of NCI director. Dr. Bertagnolli succeeds Norman E. Sharpless, M.D., who stepped down as director in April 2022. Douglas R. Lowy, M.D., has been NCI’s acting director since April 30, 2022. “I look forward to working with Dr. Bertagnolli to advance the President’s call to end cancer as we know it. Dr. Bertagnolli’s decades of cancer research expertise around patient-centered care and her work to create more inclusive clinical trials will be instrumental as we accelerate the rate of research and innovation to fight cancer,” said Secretary Xavier Becerra, U.S. Health and Human Services. “Cancer knows no bounds and neither should our efforts to prevent cancer deaths. Together, we will reignite and advance the President’s Cancer Moonshot initiative to save lives.” “Dr. Bertagnolli brings exceptional experience to NIH as a surgical oncologist, professor, scientist, and leader in the cancer research community,” said Lawrence A. Tabak, D.D.S., Ph.D., who is performing the duties of the NIH director. “She is ideally suited to lead NCI at a point in time when opportunities abound for major advancements in cancer research and cancer care.” Dr. Bertagnolli joins NCI from Harvard Medical School, where she served as the Richard E. Wilson Professor of Surgery in the field of surgical oncology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. She also was a surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a member of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Treatment and Sarcoma Centers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. In addition to treating gastrointestinal cancers and soft tissue sarcomas, Dr. Bertagnolli is a highly regarded cancer researcher. Earlier in her career, she led the Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib Trial, which showed that daily use of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib (Celebrex) could lower the risk of precancerous colorectal polyps coming back. Her leadership in the NCI-funded Cooperative Groups Program (now NCI’s National Clinical Trials Network) has led to the integration of tumor-specific biomarkers in clinical trial protocols. More recently, her research on the APC gene and the role of inflammation in influencing its activity has transformed our understanding of how colorectal cancer develops. Her experience as a physician-scientist inspired Dr. Bertagnolli to become an advocate for increasing the diversity of patients in clinical trials. She has championed and advanced patient-focused programs in rural and remote communities. “I am thrilled to begin my work at NCI, in partnership with the cancer community,” said Dr. Bertagnolli. “I think of the patients I’ve lost in 37 years as a doctor and how much more we can do for people today. That progress drives me to do more—to do everything we can to save more lives. “I see our work as aimed at three broad goals: understanding how cancer arises and what biological processes it disrupts; developing and testing new prevention and therapy approaches; and partnering with patients to develop ways for all people to receive the care that best meets their needs and, if they wish, to participate in research,” she continued. “With the passion and commitment of the President and his administration to the Cancer Moonshot℠, I believe the opportunities before us to improve the outlook for cancer patients are unprecedented.” Dr. Bertagnolli also has served as vice president of Coalition of Cancer Cooperative Groups, group chair of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, president of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Foundation, and CEO of Alliance Foundation Trials, LLC. She served as president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology from 2018-2019 and was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2021. She earned a bachelor’s degree in engineering from Princeton University in New Jersey and a medical degree from the University of Utah School of Medicine, completing a residency at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. She served as an attending surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center before joining Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in 1999. Dr. Lowy will resume his role as principal deputy director of NCI and will continue his work as chief of the Laboratory of Cellular Oncology in NCI’s Center for Cancer Research.

Partnerships   Partnerships  Our Engagement with Cancer Advocates, Advocacy Organizations, and the Cancer Patient Community The NCI Cancer Community Partnership is interested in forming relationships with patient advocates, advocacy organizations, and individuals personally affected by cancer as well as their care partners –those who provide support for a person throughout their experience with cancer. In forming this partnership, we ask that individuals bring open and honest dialog and the perspectives and experiences that affect them, or the perspectives of a larger cancer community that you identify with. Some trainees have never had the opportunity to work directly with people living with cancer. We hope this experience is mutually beneficial - trainees will learn communication skills and gain inspiration for their work and research directions while providing individuals with a welcoming space to share their stories. We would also have the opportunity to learn more about recent developments in cancer science through research presentations and discussion panels. We welcome you to this shared classroom where we are all both a teacher and student. Together, we will learn from one another and form a partnership based on conversations occurring on equal grounds. We aim to amplify and empower a diverse range of voices by providing a platform to share your insights with scientists, health care providers, and others. We hope that you/your organization might be interested in participating in this partnership. We would be happy to provide more information or to meet to discuss the partnership and potential involvement in more detail. The NCI Cancer Community Partnership is interested in forming connections with providers in the community. We believe physicians and healthcare providers are an important part of forming the partnership between scientific research and people living with cancer. In our efforts to bring a range of voices and perspectives to the table, we invite you to share your insights as a cancer care provider. Our hope is to reach providers from a variety of settings including rural, community, and academic center practitioners. We hope to provide opportunities to learn about advances in cancer research from investigators at the NCI and to gain a deeper understanding of the patient experience by hearing insights of individuals living with cancer (as well as those caring for them). In turn, we ask that you bring your knowledge and expertise as a care provider along with a willingness to listen and learn as we embark on this unique endeavor of building this mutual learning community surrounding cancer care and research. Should you be interested in learning more, we would be happy to provide more information or to meet to discuss the partnership and any potential involvement in more detail. The NCI Cancer Community Partnership is interested in forming connections with researchers and scientists. We believe your presence in these conversations around cancer knowledge and care can help ensure a diverse range of voices contribute to conversations regarding all stages of research and patient experience Participating in this mutual learning community will help gain a better understanding of the people whose lives are impacted by your work. As clinical, behavioral, or basic science researchers, these insights can provide personal motivation, inspire future laboratory discoveries, and continue to bridge the gap between the bench and bedside. You will also have the opportunity to share your research, a literature review, or a presentation on a topic of interest with the cancer community. These opportunities will strengthen your science communication skills as you present clear and concise information to lay and research audiences alike. Finally, you will have the opportunity to form lasting partnerships with people living with cancer, their care partners, and patient advocates that could help lead to incorporating patient voices into your future projects. If you are interested, we would be happy to provide you more information or to meet to discuss the partnership and your potential involvement in more detail If you have additional questions and/or are interested in participating with the NCI Cancer Community Partnership, please email us at cancercommunity@nih.gov.

T!tle : Osteosarcoma TP53 Inherited Gene Mutation Adolescents - NCI
ur$ : https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/osteosarcoma-tp53-inherited-gene-mutation-adolescents
d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  2015  A higher than expected fraction of adolescent osteosarcoma patients carry a gene mutation that is often inherited   News Releases   Posted:
April 20, 2015  240-760-6600 A new study shows that inherited variations in a known tumor suppressor gene among children and adolescents with osteosarcoma, a cancer of the bone, are more common than previously thought. Older patients who are also susceptible to this malignancy were not found to carry mutations in the gene, known as TP53. The study, finding that the genetic susceptibility to young onset osteosarcoma is distinct from older adult onset osteosarcoma, was published online April 20, 2015, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Lisa Mirabello, Ph.D., of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, led the research. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health. The incidence of osteosarcoma peaks between the ages of 10 and 19. This cancer often arises in people with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a cancer predisposition syndrome that is most often caused by germline or inherited mutations in the TP53 gene. LFS results in a constellation of tumors, often occurring at very young ages. Osteosarcoma can also occur in families that are not known to have LFS. The role of inherited TP53 mutations in osteosarcoma patients not known to have LFS is not very well understood. To try to gain a better understanding of the contribution of TP53 mutations in osteosarcoma, study researchers sequenced the TP53 gene in a random set of 765 osteosarcoma patients, the largest population evaluated for these mutations to date. For all patients, DNA was taken for sequencing from cells found in the blood or in tissue in the mouth. DNA from tumors was not available. “We found a higher than expected prevalence of TP53 mutations in young patients. In particular, we observed mutations known to be associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome as well as rare and potentially highly damaging novel genetic changes,” said Dr. Mirabello. “Some of these changes were associated with risk of metastasis at diagnosis, as well as lower survival independent of the presence of metastatic disease.” Among the young (less than age 30) osteosarcoma patients in the study, 3.8 percent carried an LFS-associated mutation in the TP53 gene and 5.7 percent carried a rare TP53 variation of the gene, for a total prevalence of TP53 mutations of 9.5 percent, significantly higher than the previously reported prevalence of about 3 percent. None of the older osteosarcoma patients carried an LFS-associated mutation. Because the osteosarcoma patients were identified based on prior studies, the researchers did not have information on family history of cancer. The finding that nearly 4 percent of pediatric osteosarcoma cases have a LFS-associated germline TP53 mutation is important because these individuals, and possibly their family members, may be at risk of developing other LFS-associated cancers. "The findings highlight the potential importance of sequencing the germline DNA in patients with pediatric osteosarcoma, because the germline analysis might uncover new cases of Li-Fraumeni syndrome,” said Doug Lowy, M.D., acting director, NCI. Testing for germline TP53 mutations is also important because individuals with LFS have a substantial risk for a second cancer. Knowing that level of risk could help clinicians offer genetic counseling and cancer screening so subsequent malignancies may be detected at an earlier stage and potentially improve patient survival. Additionally, 90 percent of osteosarcomas that develop in young people do not have germline TP53 mutations and further research is needed to understand those cases. ### Reference: Mirabello, L. et al., 2015.

Peripheral nerves are those outside of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). MPNST is a type of sarcoma. This cancer grows in the soft tissues of the body, such as muscle, fat, tendons, ligaments, lymph and blood vessels, nerves, and other tissue that connects and supports the body. MPSNST grows quickly and can spread to other parts of the body. Sarcomas are rare cancers and MPNST is a rare type of sarcoma, making up 5% to 10% of sarcoma cases. MPNST is most common in young adults and middle-aged adults. MPNST is more common in people with a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). About 25% to 50% of people with MPNST have NF1. And about 8% to 13% of people with NF1 will get MPNST in their lifetime. Some people with MPNST do not have symptoms at first. Later, when the tumor gets larger, symptoms can include: pain  weakness  a growing lump under the skin  Imaging: If you have symptoms of MPNST your doctor will use scans such as MRI, CT, and PET to see where the tumor is and how big it is. They will also check for signs that the tumor has spread to other parts of the body. Biopsy: To check if the tumor is MPNST your doctor will do a biopsy, taking a small sample from the tumor with a needle. An expert, called a pathologist, will study cells from the sample under the microscope and run other tests to see what kind of tumor it is. Surgery: Once MPNST is diagnosed, you may have surgery to remove the tumor and surrounding tissue. But sometimes surgery is not an option. In that case, your doctor will discuss other options with you. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy can be used before and after surgery. Chemotherapy: If the tumor can’t be safely removed by surgery, chemotherapy can be used to shrink it and make it easier to remove. Sometimes chemotherapy is used with radiation. Chemotherapy can also be used when MPNST has spread to other parts of the body. It is important to talk with a team of specialists to decide the right treatment for you. You can contact MyPART for help finding experts near you. In rare cases, members of the same family may have MPNST. People who have NF1 plus a family history of MPNST may be more likely to get MPNST. MPNST forms when the sheath cells that cover nerves grow and divide more than normal. The fact that almost half of MPNSTs occur in people with neurofibromatosis type 1 may give scientists some clues. Scientists are always working to understand how cancer forms, but it can be hard to prove. The estimate of how a disease will affect you long-term is called prognosis. Each person is different and prognosis will depend on many factors, such as: Where the tumor is in your body  If the cancer has spread to other parts of your body  How much of the tumor was taken out during surgery  If you want information on your prognosis, it is important to talk to your doctor. Also, NCI has resources to help you understand cancer prognosis. The five-year survival rate for people with MPNST is between 23% and 69%. How long someone with MPNST lives depends on the size of the tumor and where it is in the body. People with smaller tumors tend to live longer than people whose cancer has spread to other parts of the body. It is very important to work with a team of experts as soon as possible after diagnosis to improve your chances of survival. You can contact MyPART for help connecting with experts in MPNST.

T!tle : Physical activity lowers risk of death among older adults - NCI

d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  Many types of leisure time activity may lower risk of death for older adults   News Releases   Posted:
August 24, 2022  240-760-6600 Many types of physical activity may lower risk of death. Older adults who participate weekly in many different types of leisure time activity, such as walking for exercise, jogging, swimming laps, or playing tennis, may have a lower risk of death from any cause, as well as death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, according to a new study led by researchers at the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. The findings suggest that it’s important for older adults to engage in leisure time activities that they enjoy and can sustain, because many types of these activities may lower the risk of death, the authors wrote. The findings appear Aug. 24 in JAMA Network Open. Using data from 272,550 adults between ages 59 and 82 who had completed questionnaires about their leisure time activities as part of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, the researchers looked at whether participating in equivalent amounts of seven different exercise and recreational activities—including running, cycling, swimming, other aerobic exercise, racquet sports, golf, and walking for exercise—was associated with lowered risk of death. The researchers found that achieving the recommended amount of physical activity per week through any combination of these activities was associated with a 13% lower risk of death from any cause compared with no participation. When they looked at the role of each activity individually, playing racquet sports was associated with a 16% reduction in risk and running with a 15% reduction. However, all activities were similarly associated with lower risks of death. The second edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults engage in 2.5 to 5 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, or 1.25 to 2.5 hours of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, each week. The levels of activity by the most active individuals (those who exceeded the recommended levels of physical activity) were associated with even greater reductions in the risk of death, but there were diminishing returns as activity levels increased. Even people who did some recreational activity, though less than the recommended amount, had a 5% reduction in risk of death than those who did not participate in any of the activities studied. These activities were also associated with a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer. Playing racquet sports was associated with the greatest reduction in risk of cardiovascular deaths (27% reduction), while running was associated with the greatest reduction in risk of cancer deaths (19% reduction).

T lymphocytes that usually possess the helper/inducer cell surface phenotype. 
These kinds of neoplasms initially present as skin involvement and, as such, have been
classified as cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.[1]   Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas should be distinguished from other T-cell lymphomas that
involve the skin, such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma (CD30 positive),
peripheral T-cell lymphoma (CD30 negative, with no epidermal involvement),
adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (usually with systemic involvement), or
subcutaneous panniculitic T-cell lymphoma.[2,3]  These histologic types
of T-cell lymphomas are discussed in Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment. Typically, the natural history of mycosis fungoides   is indolent.[4]  Symptoms of the disease
may present for long periods, in a range  of 2 to 10 years, because cutaneous eruptions wax and wane
before they receive a biopsy confirmation.  Mycosis fungoides  and Sézary syndrome are  treatable with
available topical therapy, systemic therapy, or both.  To date, curative modalities  have
proven elusive, with the possible exception of patients with minimal
disease confined to the skin. In
addition, several benign or indolent conditions can be confused with
mycosis fungoides.  Consultation with a pathologist who has
expertise in distinguishing these conditions is important.[1] The prognosis of patients with mycosis fungoides  and Sézary syndrome is based on the extent of disease (stage) at
presentation.[5] The presence of lymphadenopathy and involvement of
peripheral blood and viscera increase in likelihood with worsening cutaneous
involvement and define poor prognostic groups.[5-8] The Cutaneous Lymphoma International Consortium retrospectively reviewed 1,275 patients and found the following four independent prognostic markers indicate a worse survival:[9] Stage IV disease. Age older than 60 years. Large cell transformation. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase. The median survival
following diagnosis varies according to stage.  Patients with stage IA disease
have a median survival of 20 years or more.  Most deaths for this
group are not caused by, nor are they related to, mycosis fungoides.[10,11]  In contrast, more
than 50% of patients with stage III through stage IV disease die of mycosis fungoides, with a
median survival of approximately 5 years.[7,9,12,13] The Cutaneous Lymphoma International Prognostic index used male gender, age older than 60 years, plaques, lymph nodes, blood involvement, and visceral involvement as poor prognostic factors to define predicted overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival in both early-stage and advanced-stage groups.[14] A report on 1,798 patients from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database found an increase in second malignancies (standardized incidence ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15–1.52), especially for Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and myeloma.[15] Another report on 4,459 patients from the SEER database found that the 19.2% of African American patients with mycosis fungoides have a shorter OS, potentially attributable to disease characteristics, socioeconomic status, and type of therapy (hazard ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.25–1.74; P < .001).[16] Cutaneous disease can manifest itself as an eczematous patch or plaque stage
covering less than 10% of the body surface (T1), a plaque stage covering
10%  or more of the body surface (T2), or as tumors
(T3) that frequently undergo necrotic ulceration.[17,18]  Several retrospective studies showed that 20% of patients progress from stage I or II disease to stage III or IV disease.[19-21] Sézary syndrome presents with generalized erythroderma (T4) and peripheral blood involvement.  However, there is some disagreement about  whether mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are actually variants of the same disease.[22] The same retrospective study with a median follow-up of 14.5 years found that only 3% of 1,422 patients progressed from mycosis fungoides to Sézary syndrome.[19] There is consensus that patients with Sézary syndrome (leukemic involvement) have a poor prognosis (median survival, 4 years), with or without the typical generalized erythroderma.[23,24] Cytologic transformation from a low-grade lymphoma to a high-grade
lymphoma (large cell transformation) occurs rarely (<5%) during the course of these diseases and is associated
with a poor prognosis.[25-27]  A retrospective analysis of 100 cases with large cell transformation found reduced disease-specific survival with extracutaneous transformation, increased extent of skin lesions, and CD30 negativity.[28] A common cause of death during the tumor phase is
septicemia caused by  chronic skin
infection with staph species, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and fungal skin infections.[29,30] Folliculotropic mycosis fungoides  is a variant of mycosis fungoides marked by folliculotropic, rather than epidermotropic, neoplastic infiltrates, with preferential location in the head and neck area.[31] Early plaque-stage folliculotropic mycosis fungoides have a very indolent prognosis, while extracutaneous disease portends a very poor prognosis.[31] Wilcox RA: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: 2017 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management.

(convoluted lymphocytes), a band-like upper dermal infiltrate, and epidermal
infiltrations with Pautrier abscesses (collections of neoplastic
lymphocytes).  A definitive diagnosis of Sézary syndrome may be made from a peripheral blood
evaluation when skin biopsies are consistent with the diagnosis. Supportive evidence for circulating Sézary cells is provided by T-cell receptor gene analysis, identification of the atypical lymphocytes with hyperconvoluted or cerebriform nuclei, and flow cytometry with the characteristic deletion of cell surface markers such as CD7 and CD26.   However, none of these is individually pathognomonic for lymphoma.[1,2] Olsen EA, Rook AH, Zic J, et al.: Sézary syndrome: immunopathogenesis, literature review of therapeutic options, and recommendations for therapy by the United States Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium (USCLC).

involvement with mycosis fungoides  or Sézary syndrome  cells is correlated with more
advanced skin stage, lymph node and visceral involvement, and shortened
survival. Mycosis fungoides  and Sézary syndrome also have a formal staging system proposed by the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).[2,3] Primary cutaneous lymphomas.

have shown an 80% to 90% complete remission rate with early cutaneous stages
achieving the best responses.  PUVA may be used in conjunction with systemic
treatment.[3]  Continued maintenance therapy with PUVA at more
protracted intervals is generally required to prolong remission duration.[3-6] 
PUVA combined with interferon alpha-2a is associated with a high response 
rate.[3,7] Narrowband ultraviolet B radiation.Single-arm and retrospective comparisons confirm narrowband ultraviolet B with 80% to 90% complete remission rates, especially for patients with early cutaneous stages.[8,9]A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis compared PUVA with narrowband ultraviolet B radiation in 778 patients with early-stage mycosis fungoides (stage IA, IB, and IIA). Significantly higher complete responses were seen in patients treated with PUVA (73.8% versus 62.2%; HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.02–2.76; P = .04), with no significant differences in adverse effects.[10][Level of evidence B3] Extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP) alone [11-14]
or in combination with
total-skin electron-beam radiation (TSEB).[15] ECP is particularly applicable for Sézary syndrome and erythrodermic mycosis fungoides.[14]In a retrospective analysis of 65 patients, with a median follow-up of 48 months, use of ECP in the first to third line of treatment yielded a longer median time-to-needing-treatment than other systemic options (P < .03).[14][Level of evidence C3] Therapeutic trials with PUVA

appropriate energies will penetrate only to the dermis, and thus the skin alone
can be treated without systemic effects.  This therapy requires a
radiation therapy facility with physics support and considerable
technical expertise to deliver precise dosimetry. TSEB can result in short- and long-term cutaneous
toxic effects and is not widely available.  This therapy can provide excellent palliation, with
complete response rates of as much as  80%, and may be combined with systemic treatment. Based on the long-term survival of
these early-stage patients, electron-beam radiation therapy is sometimes used with 
curative intent.[16-20]  Long-term disease-free survival (DFS) can be achieved in
patients with unilesional mycosis fungoides treated with local radiation
therapy.[21] Local electron-beam radiation or orthovoltage radiation therapy may be
used to palliate areas of bulky or symptomatic skin disease.[22,23] Electron-beam radiation of

or interferon gamma alone or in combination with topical therapy.[24,25]A retrospective review of 198 patients with mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome compared time to next treatment (TTNT) between interferon alpha and conventional chemotherapy. Interferon alpha provided a longer TTNT of 8.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.0–18.0) than did chemotherapy, with a TTNT of 3.9 months (95% CI, 3.2–5.1) and P < .00001.[26][Level of evidence C3] A retrospective review of 198 patients with mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome compared time to next treatment (TTNT) between interferon alpha and conventional chemotherapy.

chemotherapy with mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard).This form of treatment may be
used palliatively or to supplement therapeutic approaches directed against
nodal or visceral disease.  Topical application of
mechlorethamine has produced regression of cutaneous lesions, with particular
efficacy in early stages of disease.  The overall complete remission rate is
related to skin stage; 50% to 80% of TNM classification T1 patients, 25% to 75% of
T2 patients, as many as  50% of T3
patients, and 20% to 40% of T4 patients  have complete responses.  The overall complete remission rate in 243 patients
was 64% and was related to stage; as many as 35% of stage IV patients had complete
responses. Treatments are usually continued for 2 to
3 years.  Continuous 5-year DFS may be possible in  as many as 33% of T1 patients.[16,27,28] Oral methotrexate (NCT00425555).[29] Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.[30-32] Fludarabine, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, and pentostatin are active agents for mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome.[25,33-35]Chemotherapeutic agents generally demonstrate short durations of response.  In a retrospective review of 198 patients with advanced-stage disease, the median time before patients required new therapy was 4 months.[26] However,  these comparisons may be confounded by the order in which the agents were introduced. Single-agent chemotherapy or combination systemic chemotherapy (chlorambucil plus prednisone, mechlorethamine,
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and combination chemotherapy) are often combined with
treatment directed at the skin.[26,36-38]Chemotherapeutic agents generally demonstrate short durations of response. In a retrospective review of 198 patients with advanced-stage disease, the median time before patients required new therapy was 4 months.[26] However, these comparisons may be confounded by the order in which the agents were introduced.

Low potency steroids can be used on the face with safety and efficacy.[41] Bexarotene, an oral or topical retinoid (NCT00255801).[42,43] Lenalidomide.[44] Vorinostat or romidepsin or other histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi).[1,45-47]A retrospective review of 198 patients with mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome compared TTNT between HDACi and conventional chemotherapy. HDACi provided a longer TTNT of 4.5 months (95% CI, 4.0–6.1) than did chemotherapy, with a TTNT of 3.9 months (95% CI, 3.2–5.1; P = .01).[26][Level of evidence C3] A retrospective review of 198 patients with mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome compared TTNT between HDACi and conventional chemotherapy.

Allogeneic or autologous bone
marrow transplantation.[51-54]Among these highly selected patients, the 5-year OS rate ranges from 30% to 50%, with a relapse-free survival rate of 15% to 25%.[51-55] Among these highly selected patients, the 5-year OS rate ranges from 30% to 50%, with a relapse-free survival rate of 15% to 25%.[51-55] Pembrolizumab.Anecdotal responses have been seen in patients with advanced relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides. In a single-arm, multicenter, phase II trial of 24 patients treated with pembrolizumab, the overall response rate was 38%.[56][Level of evidence C3] Anecdotal responses have been seen in patients with advanced relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides. In a single-arm, multicenter, phase II trial of 24 patients treated with pembrolizumab, the overall response rate was 38%.[56][Level of evidence C3] Anecdotal responses, some lasting for months, can be seen with aggressive antibiotic treatment of Staphylococcus aureus, with corresponding decreased expression of interleukin-2 receptors, STAT signaling, and T-cell proliferation.[57][Level of evidence C3] These types of treatments produce
remissions, but long-term remissions are uncommon.  Treatment, therefore,  is considered palliative for most patients,
although major symptomatic improvement is regularly achieved.  Survival in excess of 8 years, however,  is common for patients with early stages of disease.  All patients with mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are
candidates for clinical trials evaluating new approaches to treatment.

lesions in this stage, the choice of therapy is dependent on local expertise
and the facilities available.  With therapy, the survival of patients with
stage IA disease can be expected to be the same as for age- and gender-matched
controls.[1-3] There is no curative therapy and no clear difference in overall survival (OS) among the treatment options for patients with stage I and stage II mycosis fungoides. A randomized study of 103 patients compared combined total-skin electron-beam radiation
(TSEB) plus combination chemotherapy with  sequential topical therapies.[4]  In the latter group, combination
chemotherapy was reserved for symptomatic extracutaneous disease or for disease
that was refractory to topical therapies.  Patients with any disease stage were eligible. 
Although the complete response rate was higher with combined therapy, toxic
effects were considerably greater,  and no difference was seen in disease-free
or OS between the two  groups.[4][Level of evidence A1] Treatment options for stages I and II  mycosis fungoides include the following:[5] Photodynamic therapy.Psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) radiation.[6-11]Narrowband ultraviolet B radiation.[12,13] Radiation therapy.TSEB.[14-19]Local electron-beam radiation or orthovoltage radiation therapy may be
used to palliate areas of bulky or symptomatic skin disease.[20,21] Biologic therapy.Interferon alpha
or interferon gamma alone or in combination with topical therapy.[22,23][Level of evidence C3] Chemotherapy.Topical
chemotherapy with mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard).[14,24,25]Oral methotrexate (NCT00425555).[26]Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.[27-29]Fludarabine, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, and pentostatin are active agents for
MF.[30-33]Single-agent chemotherapy or combination systemic chemotherapy (chlorambucil plus prednisone, mechlorethamine,
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and combination chemotherapy) often combined with
treatment directed at the skin.[4,23,34,35]Pralatrexate (folate analog).[23,36,37] Other drug therapy.Symptomatic management with topical corticosteroids. Low potency steroids can be used on the face with safety and efficacy.[38]Bexarotene, an oral or topical retinoid (NCT00255801).[39,40]Lenalidomide.[41]Vorinostat or romidepsin or other histone deacetylase inhibitors.[23,42-44][Level of evidence C3] Targeted therapy.Brentuximab vedotin.[45,46] Psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) radiation.[6-11] Narrowband ultraviolet B radiation.[12,13] TSEB.[14-19] Local electron-beam radiation or orthovoltage radiation therapy may be

The use of single alkylating agents has produced objective responses in 60% of
patients, with a duration of less than 6 months.  One of the alkylating agents
(e.g., mechlorethamine [nitrogen mustard], cyclophosphamide, or chlorambucil), or the antimetabolite
methotrexate is the most frequently used.  Single agents have not been shown to
cure any patients, and insufficient data exist to determine whether these
agents prolong survival.  Combination chemotherapy is not definitely superior
to single agents.  Even in stage IV disease, treatments directed at the skin
may provide significant palliation. A randomized study of 103 patients compared combined total-skin electron-beam radiation
(TSEB) plus combination chemotherapy with conservation therapy consisting of
sequential topical therapies.[1]  In the latter group, combination
chemotherapy was reserved for symptomatic extracutaneous disease or for disease
refractory to topical therapies.  Patients with any stage were eligible. 
Although the complete response rate was higher with combined therapy, toxic
effects were considerably greater, and no difference was seen in disease-free survival
or OS between the two groups.[1][Level of evidence A1] Sézary Syndrome Sézary syndrome is a rare leukemic variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma characterized by erythroderma, circulating Sézary cells with cerebriform nuclei, lymphadenopathy, and pruritus.[2] This condition typically progresses rapidly with only short duration of response to most therapies. A retrospective review of 176 patients with SS identified the following poor prognostic factors:[3] High lactate dehydrogenase. Previous diagnosis of mycosis fungoides. Presence of T-cell receptor gene rearrangements in skin, blood, or both. Remissions attained by using extracorporeal photophoresis, alpha interferon, or retinoids may be followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In an anecdotal series of 16 patients with Sézary syndrome after allogeneic transplant, 9 were in complete remission after 4 years.[4] Treatment options for stages III and IV  mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome include the following (note that in this clinical setting, the skin is
easily injured; any of the topical therapies must be administered with extreme
caution):[2,5] Photodynamic therapy.Psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) radiation.[6-10]Narrowband ultraviolet B radiation.[11,12]Extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP) alone [13-16]
or in combination with
TSEB.[17] ECP is particularly applicable for Sézary syndrome and erythrodermic mycosis fungoides.[16] Radiation therapy.TSEB.[18-23]Local electron-beam radiation or orthovoltage radiation therapy may

radiation oncologist.  It may be possible to re-treat localized areas of
relapse in the skin with additional electron-beam radiation or possibly to repeat total-skin electron-beam radiation therapy (TSEB).[1]  Photon radiation to bulky skin or
nodal masses may prove beneficial.  If these options are not possible, then
continued topical treatment with other modalities such as mechlorethamine or
psoralen and ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA) may be warranted to relieve
cutaneous symptoms. Clinical trials, if possible, should be considered as the next therapeutic
option. Treatment options under clinical evaluation  for recurrent mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome include the following:[2,3] Radiation therapy.Additional electron-beam radiation or a repeat of TSEB.Photon radiation to bulky skin or nodal masses.[4] Photodynamic therapy.Topical treatment with mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard) or PUVA.PUVA combined with interferon alpha-2a is associated with a high
response rate.[5]Narrowband ultraviolet B radiation.[6,7]Extracorporeal photophoresis has produced tumor
regression in patients resistant to other therapies.[8,9] Chemotherapy.Pralatrexate (folate analog).[10,11]Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.[12-14]Systemic chemotherapy: chlorambucil plus prednisone, mechlorethamine,
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and combination chemotherapy.[15-18] Other drug therapy.Symptomatic management with topical corticosteroids.Bexarotene, an oral or topical retinoid.[19,20]Lenalidomide.[21]Vorinostat or romidepsin or other histone deacetylase inhibitors.[22-24] Biologic therapy.Interferon alpha alone or in combination with other agents, such as topical therapy.[25,26] Transplantation.Allogeneic bone
marrow or stem cell transplantation.[27-29,29-31] Targeted therapy.Brentuximab vedotin.[32,33]Mogamulizumab.[34] Additional electron-beam radiation or a repeat of TSEB. Photon radiation to bulky skin or nodal masses.[4] Topical treatment with mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard) or PUVA. PUVA combined with interferon alpha-2a is associated with a high
response rate.[5] Narrowband ultraviolet B radiation.[6,7] Extracorporeal photophoresis has produced tumor
regression in patients resistant to other therapies.[8,9] Pralatrexate (folate analog).[10,11] Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.[12-14] Systemic chemotherapy: chlorambucil plus prednisone, mechlorethamine,
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and combination chemotherapy.[15-18] Symptomatic management with topical corticosteroids. Bexarotene, an oral or topical retinoid.[19,20] Lenalidomide.[21] Vorinostat or romidepsin or other histone deacetylase inhibitors.[22-24] Interferon alpha alone or in combination with other agents, such as topical therapy.[25,26] Allogeneic bone
marrow or stem cell transplantation.[27-29,29-31] Brentuximab vedotin.[32,33] Mogamulizumab.[34] (Refer to the Treatment Option Overview for Mycosis Fungoides  [Including Sézary Syndrome] section of this summary for more information on these treatment options.)

Introduction to Grants Process


NCI Grant Policies


Legal Requirements   Introduction to Grants Process  NCI Grant Policies  Legal Requirements  Research grants are subject to a variety of policy requirements. Below are highlights of policy announcements or changes specific to NCI. The NIH Grants Policy Statement and the NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts contain the comprehensive grants administration policies, laws, and regulations for NIH research. Sharing scientific data accelerates biomedical research discovery, enables validation of research results, provides access to datasets of sufficient quality, and promotes data reuse for future research studies. The 2023 NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing (DMS) aims to promote the broad and equitable sharing of scientific data. The DMS applies to all intramural and extramural research, regardless of funding mechanism. Under the 2023 DMS policy, NIH expects investigators and their institutions to: prospectively plan and budget for the management and sharing of data  submit a DMS plan for review when applying for funding  comply with the approved DMS plan  In addition to the DMS policy, Cancer MoonshotSM investigators should also review the NCI Cancer Moonshot Public Access and Data Sharing Policy. Genomic research helps to advance our understanding of factors that influence health and disease. Sharing genomic research data is essential for translating research results into knowledge, products, and procedures that improve human health. The NCI Office of Data Sharing (ODS), headquartered within the Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT), advocates for the proper balance of open-access, open-source, and open-data-sharing policies. ODS provides specific NCI guidance for navigating the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy and associated procedures, including when the policy applies, templates, exceptions, and additional information for intramural investigators, grantees, and non-NIH funded investigators. For more information about the policy, please see Data Sharing on the CBIIT website. Consistent with the mission of the NCI to provide evidence-based approaches to cancer therapy, NCI believes that the full value of NCI-Supported Interventional Clinical Trials can be realized only if the final results of clinical trials are published as rapidly as possible. Timely and comprehensive access to the final results of clinical trials by investigators, clinicians and patients is particularly important for interventional cancer research studies because of their potential to directly impact patient care. The NCI Clinical Trials Access Policy applies to all NCI funded research grants, cooperative agreements, and/or contracts that support covered interventional clinical trials. NIH has made several policy changes to improve the stewardship of clinical trials across the life cycle of the trial that impact the ongoing conduct, review, and management of NCI-funded clinical trials. These policies have changed the way clinical investigators develop ideas for new trials, how NIH reviews and selects clinical trials for support and oversees research progress, and how results and aggregate data are shared broadly and rapidly to ensure rigor and efficiency in the U.S. clinical trial enterprise. For current funding opportunities, see NCI Funding Opportunity Announcements that Allow Clinical Trials. The NCI has a specific policy limiting the amount requested for the direct cost budget for a renewal application. No more than a 10% increase over the budget awarded for the last year of the prior project period (the last Type 5) may be requested. The policy applies to all Type 2 R01, U01 and P01 renewal applications regardless of the amount of the budget request or the budget format (modular or non-modular). Any deviation or alternative calculation requires prior approval from the NCI Program Director and Grants Management Specialist at least six weeks prior to submission of the renewal application. To ensure that all areas of the cancer research continuum are appropriately supported, a separate NCI payline has been established for unsolicited R01 applications submitted with direct cost requests in excess of $700,000 in any single year. Every effort will be made to maintain the large R01 payline as close as possible to the general R01 payline; however, the payline will be determined at each round. Large R01s submitted in response to RFAs or PARs, which are not reviewed by the Center for Scientific Review (CSR), are currently not percentiled and are not affected by this policy.

T!tle : Genetic risk of new cancers among childhood cancer survivors - NCI
ur$ : https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2024/polygenic-risk-scores-for-childhood-cancer-survivors
d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  For childhood cancer survivors, inherited genetic factors influence risk of cancers later in life   News Releases   Posted:
March 7, 2024  240-760-6600 Genetics may one day help inform a childhood cancer survivor’s risk of subsequent cancers. Common inherited genetic factors that predict cancer risk in the general population may also predict elevated risk of new cancers among childhood cancer survivors, according to a study led by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health. The findings, published March 7, 2024, in Nature Medicine, provide additional evidence that genetics may play an important role in the development of subsequent cancers in survivors of childhood cancer and suggest that common inherited variants could potentially inform screening and long-term follow-up of those at greatest risk. Childhood cancer survivors are known to have a higher risk of developing a new cancer later in life due to adverse effects of cancer treatment or rare inherited genetic factors. In the new study, the researchers evaluated the combined effect of common variants with history of radiation treatment and found the resulting elevated cancer risk was greater than the sum of the individual associations for treatment and genetic factors alone. “Knowledge about a person’s genetic makeup could potentially be useful in managing their risk of subsequent cancers,” said lead investigator Todd M. Gibson, Ph.D., of NCI’s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics. “The hope would be that, in the future, we can incorporate genetics along with treatment exposures and other risk factors to provide a more complete picture of a survivor’s risk of subsequent cancers to help guide their long-term follow-up care.” To assess the contribution of common inherited genetic variants to risk of subsequent cancer in people who survived childhood cancer, the research team used data from genome-wide association studies, or GWAS, that had been conducted in large populations of healthy individuals. Such studies have identified thousands of common inherited variants associated with risk of different cancers. The risk associated with a single common variant is typically small, but the effects of large numbers of variants can be bundled into a summary score, or polygenic risk score, that provides a more comprehensive estimate of someone’s genetic risk. Although polygenic risk scores have shown promise for predicting cancer risk in the general population, it has not been known whether such scores are also associated with the risk of subsequent cancer among childhood cancer survivors. To find out, the researchers looked at the association between polygenic risk scores and risk of basal cell carcinoma, female breast cancer, thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and colorectal cancer among 11,220 childhood cancer survivors from two large cohort studies. For all of these cancers except colorectal cancer, polygenic risk scores derived from GWAS in the general population were associated with the risk of these same cancers among childhood cancer survivors. The researchers then looked at basal cell carcinoma, female breast cancer, and thyroid cancer—malignancies that occurred most often in the combined data set and that are strongly linked to radiation therapy—to examine the joint effect of polygenic risk score and treatment history. They found that risk associated with the combination of higher-dose radiation exposure and higher polygenic risk score was greater than would be expected based on simply adding the risk associations of each individual risk factor. For basal cell carcinoma, a high polygenic risk score was associated with 2.7-fold increased risk compared with a low polygenic risk score among survivors. History of higher radiation exposure to the skin was associated with a 12-fold increase in risk, compared with lower radiation exposure to the skin. However, survivors with high polygenic risk scores and higher doses of radiation to the skin had an 18.3-fold increased risk of basal cell carcinoma, compared with those with low polygenic risk scores who had received lower radiation doses to the skin. Moreover, by age 50, survivors with higher polygenic risk scores and higher radiation exposure had a greater cumulative incidence of basal cell carcinoma, female breast cancer, or thyroid cancer than those with lower polygenic risk scores or lower radiation exposure. For example, among female survivors who had radiation to the chest, 33.9% of those with a high polygenic risk score had been diagnosed with breast cancer by age 50, compared with 21.4% of those with a low polygenic risk score. One limitation of the study is that the populations included in the analysis were predominantly of European ancestry, so additional studies are needed in diverse populations. Furthermore, polygenic risk scores are not yet used routinely in the clinic, although they may one day inform screening approaches or other clinical decisions. “Although these results suggest that polygenic risk scores could play a role in improving guidelines for long-term follow-up of childhood cancer survivors exposed to radiation, right now they are not sufficient on their own to alter existing guidelines,” Dr. Gibson noted.

Therefore, the information in this summary is no longer being updated and is provided for reference purposes only. This cancer information summary provides
an overview of the use of 714-X as a treatment for people with cancer.           The summary
includes a brief history of the development of 714-X; a review of laboratory,
animal, and clinical research; and possible side effects of 714-X use. This summary contains the following key information: The main ingredient of 714-X is derived
 from camphor in a chemical reaction with ammonia and sodium chloride. It is claimed that 714-X protects and stabilizes the immune system and
restores its ability to fight cancer. No study of 714-X has been published in a peer-reviewed scientific
journal to show it is safe or effective in treating cancer. 714-X is not approved for use in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration  has placed an import ban on 714-X. Many of the medical and scientific terms used in the summary are hypertext linked (at first use in each section) to the NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms, which is oriented toward nonexperts. When a linked term is clicked, a definition will appear in a separate window. Reference citations in some PDQ cancer information summaries may include links to external websites that are operated by individuals or organizations for the purpose of marketing or advocating the use of specific treatments or products. These reference citations are included for informational purposes only. Their inclusion should not be viewed as an endorsement of the content of the websites, or of any treatment or product, by the PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board or the National Cancer Institute. 714-X was developed more than 30 years ago in a privately funded laboratory in
Quebec, Canada, where it continues to be produced.  The primary component of
714-X is naturally derived camphor that is chemically modified by the introduction
of ammonia chloride moiety.   Numerous trace elements have also been found
in batches of 714-X.[1,2] The private laboratory markets 714-X worldwide through its own distribution
company.[1] In Canada,  this compound is legally available on compassionate grounds
only and must be obtained through a physician. [1,2]   Because the production of  714-X is not regulated,  there is no
guarantee that rigorous quality control procedures are followed to ensure
manufacturing consistency or product safety. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved 714-X for use as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition. In addition, the FDA has placed an import ban on 714-X. Before researchers can conduct clinical drug research in the United States, they must file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA. 
The IND application process is confidential, and information about an IND can
be disclosed only by the applicants.  No investigators have announced
that they have applied for an IND to study 714-X as a treatment for
cancer. 714-X is usually administered by injection near lymph nodes in the groin.  It can also
be administered nasally, using a nebulizer.  Nasal administration is used
for follow-up treatment and for the treatment of patients with lung or oral cancers.  The producers of 714-X do not
recommend intravenous or oral
administration.  A usual treatment cycle consists of a single daily injection
for 21 days followed by a 2- to 3-day rest period.  Between 6 and 12
treatment cycles have been recommended  by the producers.  The producers of 714-X advise a 50%
reduction in dose for  pediatric
patients who weigh less than 30 kg (66 lb).[1,2] It has been suggested that 714-X is more effective if administered early in
the disease process and before surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.  The
producers claim, however, that 714-X can also be used in conjunction with conventional treatments.  It
has been further suggested that the use of alcohol and treatment with
nonconventional therapies such as shark or bovine (i.e., cow) cartilage (and other angiogenesis inhibitors),
vitamin B12 supplements, and vitamin E supplements be avoided during 714-X
treatment.[1,2] 714X Technical Data. Rock Forest, Canada:  CERBE Distribution, Inc. Available online.  Last accessed April 7, 2016. Kaegi E: Unconventional therapies for cancer: 6. 714-X. Task Force on Alternative Therapeutic of the Canadian Breast Cancer Research Initiative. CMAJ 158 (12): 1621-4, 1998. [PUBMED Abstract] Little documentation exists regarding the development of 714-X and its
mechanism of action.  It appears to have been developed in the 1960s on the
basis of earlier studies that used a high-magnification dark-field microscope called
a somatoscope.[1,2]  With dark-field microscopes, researchers are able
to examine living cells in samples of fresh blood and tissue taken from
healthy individuals and individuals with serious diseases, including
cancer. The developer of 714-X states that the study of living cells (as opposed to the dead cells examined with a
conventional light microscope
or an electron microscope)
led to the theory that microorganisms distinct from  bacteria, viruses, and fungi exist normally in the blood and play
a role in the development of cancer.  These microorganisms, which are called
somatids, are said to exist in multiple forms, some of which appear only in
individuals affected by degenerative or malignant diseases.  The forms associated
with degenerative diseases or cancer reportedly secrete growth hormones and toxic substances that disrupt
normal cellular metabolism and damage
the immune system.  In this compromised environment, cells that have become
cancerous are allowed to proliferate.  It was also suggested
that cancer cells trap nitrogen, thereby depriving the rest of the body of the
nitrogen needed for normal cellular metabolism.  In addition, it was proposed
that cancer cells secrete a toxic substance, cocancerogenic K factor, that
further inhibits the immune system.[1,2] The producers of 714-X state that cancer can be diagnosed, and its
development and spread can be predicted, by studying blood samples with the
somatoscope.  No evidence has been published in peer-reviewed scientific
journals to support these proposals, and the somatidian theory of cancer
development is not widely accepted. 714-X reportedly works by protecting, stabilizing, and reactivating the
patient’s immune system so that the body can defend itself against cancer cell
growth and metastasis.[1-3]  714-X is said to accomplish this, in part, by helping to increase the
“fluidity” of  lymph.[3] In addition, the
camphor component of 714-X is purportedly attracted to cancer cells, where the
added nitrogen is released, thus preventing malignant cells from depleting the
nitrogen required by normal cells (including immune system cells) for proper
metabolism and function.[1,2] Kaegi E: Unconventional therapies for cancer: 6. 714-X. Task Force on Alternative Therapeutic of the Canadian Breast Cancer Research Initiative. CMAJ 158 (12): 1621-4, 1998. [PUBMED Abstract] Hess DJ: Germ warfare: the case for bacteria as carcinogen. In: Hess DJ: Can Bacteria Cause Cancer? Alternative Medicine Confronts Big Science. New York University Press, 1997, pp 7-48. 714X Technical Data. Rock Forest, Canada:  CERBE Distribution, Inc. Available online.  Last accessed April 7, 2016. No laboratory study of the safety and/or effectiveness of 714-X has been
published in  scientific literature.  A few animal experiments have been
conducted, but the results of these experiments have not been reported in
peer-reviewed scientific journals.  The animal studies utilized a lymphosarcoma tumor model in rats and lymphoma tumor models in dogs and cows. 
714-X was not found to be effective as an anticancer treatment in these
studies.[1] A few laboratory and animal studies have suggested that camphor is able
to enhance the response of the immune system to vaccine administration and to increase the
sensitivity of tumor cells to radiation therapy.[2-6]  In one series of
studies, investigators used camphor vapors as a conditioned stimulus to
promote an immune response.[2-5]  These studies demonstrated that mice exposed
to camphor vapors at the same time they received an antilymphoma vaccine
showed decreased growth of transplanted lymphoma cells and increased survival
when they were re-exposed to camphor vapors plus the vaccine or to camphor
vapors alone, in comparison with mice re-exposed to only the vaccine.[2,3] 
These investigators also demonstrated that exposure to camphor vapors led to
an increase in natural killer
cells [4] and an increase in tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells.[5]  Another
study reported that breast adenocarcinoma cells transplanted
under the skin of mice responded better to local radiation therapy when small
doses of camphor were administered by intraperitoneal injection before
the radiation treatment.[6] Finally, researchers examined nine compounds, including a
camphor-containing compound, for their ability to inhibit the activity of
estrone sulfatase, an enzyme involved in the production of estrone, which is a
precursor of the various forms of estrogen.  Estrogens are thought to
promote the growth of hormone-dependent breast cancer cells.  The 
camphor-containing compound showed only modest inhibition of estrone sulfatase
activity in human breast cancer cells grown in vitro.[7] Kaegi E: Unconventional therapies for cancer: 6. 714-X.

(i.e., clinical trials,

case reports) have been reported in
peer-reviewed scientific journals to support the safety or the efficacy of
714-X.  A number of anecdotal
reports and testimonials have
been published in newspapers and other nonmedical literature.  The producers
of 714-X state that they have tried to document the long-term experience of
patients treated with this compound, but they have encountered difficulty in
obtaining information from patients and their health care providers.[1] Kaegi E: Unconventional therapies for cancer: 6. 714-X. Task Force on Alternative Therapeutic of the Canadian Breast Cancer Research Initiative. CMAJ 158 (12): 1621-4, 1998. [PUBMED Abstract] It is claimed that 714-X is nontoxic in the  manufacturer-recommended dose range.[1,2] The only
described side effects of treatment with this compound are local redness,
tenderness, and swelling at injection sites.[2] 714X Technical Data. Rock Forest, Canada:  CERBE Distribution, Inc. Available online.  Last accessed April 7, 2016.

CMAJ 158 (12): 1621-4, 1998. [PUBMED Abstract] To assist readers in evaluating the results of human/clinical studies of
integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies for cancer, a scoring system has been devised that allows
studies of individual treatments to be ranked according to the strength of
their evidence (i.e., their level of evidence).  Not all studies, however,
are given a level of evidence score.  To be eligible, a study must: Evaluate
a therapeutic outcome(s), such as
tumor response, improvement in
survival, or carefully measured improvement in quality of life. Be reported in
a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Have its clinical findings
published in sufficient detail that a meaningful evaluation can be made. Evidence from studies that do not meet these requirements is considered extremely weak. In addition to scoring individual studies, a summary of the evidence is usually made. Because no study of the use of 714-X in humans has been reported in a
peer-reviewed scientific journal, no level of evidence analysis is possible
for this treatment.  Therefore, at this time, the use of 714-X as a treatment
for cancer cannot be recommended outside the context of well-designed clinical trials. For additional information about levels of evidence analysis, refer to Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies.

Milestones in Cancer Research and Discovery   Annual Report to the Nation  Research Advances by Cancer Type  Stories of Discovery  Milestones in Cancer Research and Discovery  Zach, an anaplastic large cell lymphoma survivor Thirteen-year-old Zach had a great day in August 2017, when he caught a home run hit by Tommy Joseph at a Philadelphia Phillies game and later met him for a ball signing. Zach’s mother, Pam, watched with pride, a marked contrast from her anguish 7 years earlier when Zach had been diagnosed with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Zach had a difficult time with his chemotherapy and relapsed halfway through treatment. His doctors proposed an NCI–Children’s Oncology Group clinical trial of crizotinib (Xalkori), a drug that targets mutations in a gene called ALK and that has been used successfully against certain lung cancers. Within 3 days of starting crizotinib, Zach transformed back to the high-octane boy his family knew best. His tumors shrank over time, and his doctors still find no evidence of cancer. An avid athlete in school and youth leagues, Zach dreams of hitting his own home runs as a professional baseball player. In Pam’s eyes, crizotinib has already been a home run. “This is a drug that saved my boy’s life,” she reflected gratefully.  Posted:

NCI’s CCG and Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) are engaged in a collaboration named Clinical Trial Sequencing Project (CTSP). This project has launched out of a joint aspiration to promote the use of genomics in NCI-sponsored clinical trials of the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). CTSP’s goal is to elucidate the molecular basis of response and resistance to therapies studied. Biospecimens collected from NCI-sponsored NCTN clinical trials will undergo whole genome or whole exome sequencing in conjunction with transcriptome sequencing to identify genomic alterations important to the hypotheses stated in the proposals. The genomic and anonymized clinical data from CTSP will be made publically available in the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) to benefit the cancer research community. The cancer types currently under study are breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment (TAILORx) is an NCI-sponsored clinical trial investigating whether some breast cancer patients may be treated effectively without undergoing chemotherapy, and if a gene expression test can help choose the best individualized treatment. CCG’s study of breast cancer tissue from TAILORx aims to illuminate the molecular basis of ER-positive, Her2-negative breast cancer response and recurrence, and to provide vital genomic information about breast cancer treatments and outcomes to the cancer research community. The trial enrolled over 10,000 women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive), human epidermal growth factor-negative (Her2-negative) breast cancer that had not spread to the lymph nodes. Each patient’s tumor was evaluated with a gene expression test for the probability of cancer recurrence following surgical removal. The trial grouped patients based on the score obtained from the gene expression test, into low, middle, and high chance of recurrence. All patients with a high risk of recurrence received chemotherapy, as did randomly assigned middle-risk patients; low-risk patients received hormone therapy only and were spared chemotherapy. Initial results published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicate that low-risk women fare well when spared chemotherapy and that the gene expression test is a clinically helpful tool for determining the best treatment for individual patients. CCG will receive tissue samples of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the most common kidney cancer in adults, from a recent NCI-sponsored clinical trial that tested the effectiveness of two inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with high-risk, non-metastatic RCC. Abnormal activity of the VEGF pathway drives RCC by stimulating the development of blood vessels that provide nutrients to the tumor. Inhibition of VEGF has been shown to be effective for the treatment of advanced RCC that has metastasized to other areas of the body. However, patients with high-risk, non-metastatic disease treated with sunitinib or sorafenib, both VEGF inhibitors, received no benefit compared to patients who received a placebo following surgical removal of their tumors. CCG will analyze approximately 400 tissue samples from the ECOG-ACRIN E2805 trial of sunitinib and sorafenib to learn more about genomic drivers of RCC development, metastasis, and recurrence. CCG will perform a comprehensive molecular analysis of tissue samples of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma, from a Phase III clinical trial run by Cancer and Leukemia Group B. The trial, Rituximab and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (NCT00118209) treated 430 DLBCL patients with rituximab, an antibody that targets B cells for destruction, in combination with one of two different chemotherapy regimens. By randomly assigning patients to either R-CHOP or Dose Adjusted-EPOCH-R, the study aims to establish which chemotherapy best complements rituximab in the treatment of DLBCL and to develop a molecular predictor of patient responses. The goal of CCG’s in-depth analysis of the DNA, RNA, and protein of DLBCL samples from this trial is to bolster the findings with rich molecular data and to add key information, including multi-platform analysis of DLBCL subtypes and predictors of tumor resistance.

Grant Closeout   Grants Management Contacts  Monitoring  Prior Approvals  Annual Reporting and Auditing  Transfer of a Grant  Grant Closeout  NIH prior approval is required for the transfer of the legal and administrative responsibility for a grant-supported project or activity from one legal entity to another before the expiration of the approved project period (period of performance). A change of recipient organization may be accomplished under most NIH grants, including construction grants. A change of recipient that involves the transfer of a grant to or between foreign institutions or international organizations must be approved by the IC’s Advisory Council or Board. A grant to an individual may not be transferred. However, an individual fellowship may be transferred to a new sponsoring organization. The transfer process will be the same as for a change of recipient organization  A change in an individual fellow’s department or sponsor within the same organization is not considered a change of recipient organization.  A successor-in-interest or a name change is not considered a change of recipient.  A change of recipient organization may involve the transfer of equipment purchased with grant funds. The transfer may be accomplished as part of the original recipient’s relinquishment of the grant; otherwise, the NIH reserves the right to transfer title to equipment to the new organization as indicated in “Administrative Requirements—Management Systems and Procedures—Property Management System Standards."  The NIH may request additional information necessary to accomplish its review of the request. Acceptance of a relinquishing statement by NIH does not guarantee approval of a transfer application for the continued funding of a project.  Change of Institution Request (Type 7) A Relinquishing Statement is required as part of the Change of Institution process that allows an extramural grant recipient institution to transfer an active grant to another institution. The process is initiated by the signing official of the institution that currently holds the award, who submits a Reliquishing Statement in the eRA Commons and identifies the institution that will take over the award. This process must occur before the expiration of the current approved project period. The receiving institution must then submit a Change of Grantee Organization application using the associated Parent Funding Opportunity Announcement.

Center for Cancer Training Erika serves as Branch Director of NCI’s Center for Cancer Training (CCT), Office of Training and Education (OTE).  Erika uses her passion for training and mentorship to manage career development programs for trainees.  Several years ago, Erika revised the Sallie Rosen Kaplan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Women Scientists to better prepare NCI’s female postdoctoral fellows to transition to independence and to retain them in science.  Fellows who have successfully completed the one-year program and have gone on to their next career stage have all remained in the biomedical workforce.   In addition, she has developed, coordinated, and evaluated other career development workshops, courses, and programs in the CCT.  Erika leads the NIH Fellows Editorial Board, NCI Explore On-Site program, and the NCI Director’s Innovation Award, just to name a few.  Her effort in initiating the Responsible Conduct of Research training course for NCI trainees was recognized by an individual NCI’s Director’s Award in 2016.  In 2006, the Association for Women in Science, Bethesda Chapter, awarded her Mentor of the Year.  As Branch Director of OTE, Erika advocates for trainees, and continues to facilitate and promote training opportunities by working closely with trainees, PIs, and senior leadership. Before joining CCT, Erika had a long career in NCI’s intramural program as a Technical Laboratory Manager in CCR’s Mammary Biology and Tumorigenesis Laboratory where she studied prolactin’s action on breast cancer. Prolactin is an important hormone responsible for the development of the breast and may be positively associated with breast cancer risk.   Together with Dr. Barbara Vonderhaar, she was the first to demonstrate that human breast cancer cells synthesize and secrete significant amounts of biologically active prolactin.  She mentored over 150 trainees in the Laboratory and has over 50 publications in the fields of drug metabolism, and hormone regulation of the normal and cancerous breast. Erika received her undergraduate training in Biophysics and Microbiology from the University of Pittsburgh, her Master’s degree from Johns Hopkins University in Science/Medical Writing, and holds a Master’s Certificate in Biotechnology Management from the University of Maryland University College.

Research Articles   Research Articles  MRI of a meningioma in the brain. NCI-funded researchers are working to improve our understanding of how to treat tumors that arise in the brain or the spinal cord (together known as the central nervous system, or CNS). Such tumors can be either benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). But the tissues of the nervous system are so important and so vulnerable that even some benign tumors may need urgent treatment. Tumors that begin in the brain or spinal cord account for less than 2% of all cancers diagnosed each year in the United States. And there are over 130 different types. This diversity and the rarity of some types pose unique challenges to developing new treatments. Often, tumors found in the brain have started somewhere else in the body and then spread to the brain. These are called metastatic brain tumors (or brain metastases). The research highlighted on this page addresses primary brain tumors (tumors that start in the tissue of the brain), not metastatic brain tumors. It also includes research into primary spinal cord tumors, which are tumors that start in the spine. The latest research on this page includes clinical advances that may soon translate into improved care and research findings from recent studies.  Diagnosis of Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors  New Treatments for Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors in Adults  Survivorship and Quality of Life for People with Brain or Spinal Cord Tumors  Treatment of Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors in Children  NCI-Supported Research Programs  Brain and Spinal Cord Tumor Research Results  Diagnosis of Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors New Treatments for Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors in Adults Survivorship and Quality of Life for People with Brain or Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment of Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors in Children NCI-Supported Research Programs Brain and Spinal Cord Tumor Research Results Diagnosis of Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Many types of brain and spinal cord tumors look similar when the cells are examined under the microscope. Even with trained pathologists examining tissue samples, up to 10% of people with a brain or spinal cord tumor receive the wrong diagnosis at first. This can potentially affect outcomes, because tumors that look similar at the cellular level may require very different treatments. NCI-funded researchers are studying ways to improve the diagnosis of brain and spinal cord tumors. For example: A type of blood test called a liquid biopsy was able to distinguish between several different types of brain tumors in adult patients. This test checks for chemical changes in tumor DNA that had been shed into the bloodstream. Researchers hope that such tests could not just improve the accuracy of diagnoses but someday be used to diagnose brain tumors without the need for invasive surgery to get biopsy samples.  A different liquid biopsy test was able to detect a specific genetic alteration in children with a rare type of brain tumor. Such tests could eventually help select patients for studies of new targeted therapies.  Another study found that a blood test that detects genomic changes in DNA shed from a brain tumor called medulloblastoma could identify children who still had evidence of cancer after treatment. Such children are at high risk of relapse and may benefit from more aggressive therapy upfront.  Scientists are also testing the use of artificial intelligence, or AI, for the analysis of images to speed the diagnosis of brain tumors during surgery.  If you have received a diagnosis of a brain and spinal cord tumor and are seeking a second opinion, the NCI-CONNECT program offers free consultations, as well as advice for patients’ cancer care teams at home. The program also runs clinical studies and trials focused on the treatment of rare adult brain and spinal cord tumors and on improving quality of life, symptom control, and management of side effects. New Treatments for Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors in Adults The mainstays of treatment for most types of brain and spinal cord tumors are surgery and radiation therapy. For some types of tumors in the CNS, chemotherapy is also used. Because these treatments can damage normal cells as well as tumor cells in the brain and spinal cord, they may come with serious side effects. These include memory and thinking problems, mood changes, and difficulty walking. In addition to their toxicity, these treatments are not always effective, especially for aggressive types of brain cancer, such as glioblastoma. This cancer, the most common type of brain tumor, usually comes back (recurs) rapidly after treatment. Researchers are searching for ways to improve the treatment of brain and spinal cord tumors, including the following three strategies: Personalized medicine uses information about a person’s own genes or proteins to prevent, diagnose, or treat disease. Over the last decade, scientists have discovered that tumors arising from the same type of cell can be driven by many different gene changes (also known as gene mutations). Such genetic studies hold the promise of more personalized treatments. For example, recent studies have found that some brain tumors have mutations in a gene called IDH.

	In a large clinical trial, treatment with the targeted drug vorasidenib slowed the growth of tumors in some people with low-grade gliomas that had mutations in the IDH1 or IDH2 genes, postponing the need for additional therapies.
For tumors with mutations in IDH, treatment with a type of drug called a PARP inhibitor may make them more sensitive to chemotherapy. A clinical trial is testing this strategy in people with a type of brain tumor called a glioma that has recurred after initial treatment.
Other treatments for IDH-mutated tumors are targeting changes in cancer metabolism.  Some rare types of brain tumors may depend on specific gene changes to fuel their growth. That makes such changes good targets for treatment. For example, a recent study found that targeting a gene change called BRAF V600E in a rare type of brain tumor called papillary craniopharyngioma let many people delay invasive surgery or radiation therapy for years.  Researchers are also beginning to use powerful computers to look through enormous databases of genetic mutations and combinations of genes, called gene fusions, found in brain tumors. Doing so may help them pinpoint which ones the cancer cells rely on to survive. These mutations and fusions could then potentially be targeted with new or existing drugs.  Other studies are trying to target proteins found widely in CNS tumors. For example, NCI researchers are testing a drug that blocks dopamine receptors in recurrent brain and spine tumors. Dopamine receptors are found in many of these tumor types, including glioblastoma, lower grade gliomas, and medulloblastoma.  In a large clinical trial, treatment with the targeted drug vorasidenib slowed the growth of tumors in some people with low-grade gliomas that had mutations in the IDH1 or IDH2 genes, postponing the need for additional therapies.  For tumors with mutations in IDH, treatment with a type of drug called a PARP inhibitor may make them more sensitive to chemotherapy. A clinical trial is testing this strategy in people with a type of brain tumor called a glioma that has recurred after initial treatment.  Other treatments for IDH-mutated tumors are targeting changes in cancer metabolism.  Scientists are also trying to understand other biological factors that influence brain tumor development and its response to treatment. For example, studies have found that women are less likely than men to be diagnosed with glioblastoma and their tumors tend to respond better to standard treatments. Such work may uncover further avenues for treatment personalization. Personalizing treatment of brain and spinal cord tumors makes it challenging to test new drugs, because clinical trials will be limited to fewer patients with already rare cancers. Examples of NCI-led initiatives to overcome this challenge include: The NCI-led Brain Tumor Trials Collaborative (BTTC) and NCI-CONNECT clinical trial network are established at 33 cancer centers across the county to make it easier for people with rare brain and spinal cord tumors to participate in clinical trials closer to their homes.  NCI researchers are leading efforts to reduce other barriers to clinical trial participation for people with brain or spinal cord tumors. These include allowing older adults or people who have previously been treated for other types of cancer to participate. Promoting the use of telehealth and collection of blood tests at local hospitals may also reduce the need for people to travel to participate in a research study.  Radiation therapy is already personalized to some extent because the amount and shape of the tissue that gets treated is tailored to each tumor’s size and location. However, the dose (or amount) of radiation used is usually the same for everyone with a specific tumor type. Researchers want to find ways to figure out whether a tumor’s response to radiation can be predicted before treatment. That would make it possible for people with tumors that are unlikely to shrink after standard doses of radiation to instead join clinical trials that are testing strategies like higher radiation doses. Scientists are studying whether machine learning, also called artificial intelligence or AI, can use data from MRI scans of brain tumors to predict radiation response.  Scientists are also trying to develop substances called radiation sensitizers, which increase the damage radiation does to tumor cells but not normal cells. Dozens of small clinical trials across the country are studying radiation sensitizers in glioblastoma. For example, a trial led by NCI researchers is looking at whether the drug selinexor (Xpovio), when combined with chemotherapy and radiation, can improve survival.  Immunotherapy uses substances to stimulate or suppress the immune system to help the body fight cancer. In some blood cancers and solid tumors, immunotherapy drugs have provided huge gains in survival for some people. But to date, immunotherapy has not worked well for brain tumors. Issues may include: The blood–brain barrier, which is a network of blood vessels and tissue that helps protect the brain. This barrier also prevents some drugs and types of immune cells from reaching tumors.  The widespread use of anti-inflammatory drugs called corticosteroids to manage the symptoms of brain tumors. For example,
	A recent NCI-funded study found that corticosteroids may reduce the effectiveness of immunotherapy for brain cancer by suppressing the body’s immune response. 
Another study from NCI researchers found that steroids used to treat brain cancer may affect the development of T cells, which are key immune cells for fighting cancer.  A recent NCI-funded study found that corticosteroids may reduce the effectiveness of immunotherapy for brain cancer by suppressing the body’s immune response.  Another study from NCI researchers found that steroids used to treat brain cancer may affect the development of T cells, which are key immune cells for fighting cancer.  However, some people with CNS tumors given immunotherapy in clinical trials have had their tumors shrink or disappear. Researchers want to know if these responses could be predicted, both to spare people unnecessary treatment and to develop new strategies to make resistant CNS tumors respond to immunotherapies. NCI researchers are running a clinical trial testing a combination of two immunotherapy drugs in people with newly diagnosed brain tumors. As part of the study, they’re testing whether there are changes in the types and level of activity of immune cells in the blood both before and during treatment. Measuring these changes might help predict who will benefit from immunotherapy and who won’t.  Another study led by NCI researchers is testing whether the immunotherapy drug nivolumab (Opdivo) can shrink or control the growth or spread of specific types of recurrent rare brain or spine tumors. The trial is also testing the changes that nivolumab induces in immune cells in the blood during treatment, and whether the drug can improve the symptoms of people with these tumors.  Other studies are examining whether people whose brain tumors have certain mutations, such as those in the IDH gene, are more likely to have their tumors shrink from immunotherapy.  Survivorship and Quality of Life for People with Brain or Spinal Cord Tumors Because both CNS tumors and their treatments can be debilitating, researchers are looking for new ways to improve quality of life for people with these tumors. This may include using people’s quality of life to measure the benefit of new drugs or treatment combinations. For example, in a recent NCI-led trial of a drug combination to treat a rare CNS tumor called ependymoma, most people’s tumors didn’t shrink. However, because they reported a reduction in symptoms from their tumor, the combination is now included in some professional recommendations for treatment of this cancer.  NCI scientists are looking at whether genomic factors can predict the likelihood that a patient will experience side effects from certain treatments. They’re also performing experiments in the lab to understand the biological processes linked with these side effects. Results from these studies could potentially influence treatment decisions.  For people with many cancer types, simply monitoring symptoms has been found to improve not just quality of life but survival. An NCI study is tracking symptoms and the well-being of people with brain and spinal cord tumors over time. People in that study can also take part in research to improve sleep, to reduce distress, anxiety, and depression, such as using virtual reality to reduce stress.  Treatment of Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors in Children Tumors of the brain and spinal cord in children are relatively rare. But about 4,000 children and adolescents nationwide receive a diagnosis of a brain or spinal cord tumor every year, making CNS tumors the second most common cancer type in this age group after leukemia. Treatment has improved for young patients with these tumors over the last several decades. Although some CNS tumors can’t be cured, almost three-quarters of children and adolescents treated for a brain or spinal cord tumor will be alive 5 years after diagnosis. However, effective treatments can harm children’s developing nervous systems. Current research in childhood brain and spinal cord tumors focuses on understanding the underlying causes of these cancers, developing new treatments, and reducing the toxic effects of effective therapies. For example, One study found that some children with medulloblastoma, a type of brain cancer, can safely get less radiation therapy without reducing their long-term survival. The effectiveness of this approach depended on the genetic alterations found in children’s tumors. A follow-up study is looking more closely at reducing the intensity of treatment in children with medulloblastoma caused by changes in a gene called WNT.  Some children with a type of brain tumor called low-grade glioma have a certain change in a gene called BRAF in their cancer cells. Recent results from a clinical trial found that, for these children, a combination of two targeted drugs was safer and better than standard chemotherapy at shrinking these tumors and keeping them from growing again. These drugs, dabrafenib (Tafinlar) and trametinib (Mekinist), can be given orally as a liquid, making treatment easier for children as well.  A targeted drug called selumetinib (Koselugo) is approved for treating nerve tumors in children with a rare condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) . A small study found that it could also shrink a type of brain tumor called low-grade glioma in some children with NF1 whose tumors have certain BRAF changes. NCI researchers have launched a clinical trial of the drug in children with and without NF1 who have low-grade glioma with these BRAF changes.  A rare type of brain tumor called diffuse midline glioma, which occurs more commonly in children than adults, currently has no cure. An NCI-funded clinical trial is testing CAR T cells, a type of immunotherapy, that target cells with a mutation found in some of these tumors. The treatment has been found to shrink tumors and reduce neurologic symptoms caused by the tumor in some children.  Other studies are using information about mutations in children’s brain tumors to test new treatments in those who may benefit the most. One such study, the Pediatric MATCH study is testing new targeted therapies in children with solid tumors—including those in the brain or spinal cord—that have not responded to standard treatments. In the study, children are assigned to an experimental treatment based on the genetic changes found in their tumors rather than on their type of cancer or cancer site.  Additional clinical trials for children with CNS tumors are being performed by the NCI-sponsored Children’s Oncology Group and Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium. NCI-Supported Research Programs Many NCI-funded researchers working at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) campus, as well as across the United States and throughout the world, are seeking ways to address tumors of the brain and spinal cord more effectively. Some research is basic, exploring questions such as the biological underpinnings of cancer. And some is more clinical, seeking to translate this basic information into improving patient outcomes. The programs listed below are a small sampling of NCI’s research efforts in brain and other CNS tumors. The NCI-CONNECT Rare Brain and Spine Tumor Network is part of the Rare Tumor Patient Engagement Network, an initiative supported by the Cancer Moonshot℠. The network aims to advance the understanding of rare adult CNS cancers by establishing and fostering patient–advocacy–provider partnerships and networks to improve approaches to care and treatment. Consultations are free of charge for people seeking a second opinion or expertise on a rare CNS tumor type. Patients also receive support for travel expenses, food, lodging and outpatient treatment.  The Brain Tumor Trials Collaborative network includes over 30 institutions with expertise in neuro-oncology from across the United States. The network’s mission is to develop and carry out clinical trials in a collaborative environment to advance treatments for patients with brain and spine tumors. NCI serves as the lead institution, providing administrative support, a clinical database, and oversight for the network.  NCI’s Brain Cancer Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs) promote collaborative, interdisciplinary research. SPORE grants involve both basic and clinical/applied scientists working together. They support the efficient movement of basic scientific findings into clinical settings, as well as studies to determine the biological basis for observations made in individuals with cancer or in populations at risk for cancer.  NCI's National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) is a collection of organizations and clinicians that coordinate and support cancer clinical trials at more than 3,000 sites across the United States and Canada. NCTN has a variety of trials testing treatments for brain and other CNS tumors.  NCI has also formed partnerships with the pharmaceutical industry, academic institutions, and individual investigators for the early clinical evaluation of innovative cancer therapies. The Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) was created to evaluate these therapies using a coordinated, collaborative approach to early-phase clinical trials. The ETCTN is currently running early-stage trials in brain and other CNS tumors.  NCI’s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics conducts studies on people with brain and other CNS tumors to learn about genetic and other risk factors for these diseases.  NCI’s Office of Cancer Survivorship, part of the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, supports many research projects that study survivorship issues in people who have been treated for brain tumors. NCI funds and oversees both early- and late-phase clinical trials to develop new treatments and improve patient care. Our clinical trials search form can be used to find trials to treat glioblastoma, glioma, medulloblastoma, and other types of brain and spinal cord tumors.

The light used in this treatment can't reach very far into tissue so photodynamic therapy is limited to use with small tumors that are on or just under the skin or on the lining of internal organs or cavities. It is approved to treat actinic keratosis, advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, Barrett esophagus, basal cell skin cancer, esophageal (throat) cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and very early squamous cell skin cancer. It may also be used to relieve symptoms of some cancers, such as esophageal cancer when it blocks the throat. Photodynamic therapy can harm normal cells in the treatment area and cause side effects. To learn more, visit Photodynamic Therapy for Cancer.

Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[1-3]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because cancer therapy side effects may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Pediatric soft tissue sarcomas are a heterogenous group of malignant tumors that originate from primitive mesenchymal tissue and account for 6% of all childhood tumors (rhabdomyosarcomas, 3%; other soft tissue sarcomas, 3%).[2] For more information, see the Histopathological Classification of Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma section. Rhabdomyosarcoma, a tumor of striated muscle, is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children. It accounts for 50% of the soft tissue sarcomas in children aged 0 to 14 years.[2] For more information, see Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma Treatment. In pediatrics, the remaining soft tissue sarcomas are commonly referred to as nonrhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) and account for approximately 3.5% of all childhood tumors.[2,4] This summary discusses the treatment of NRSTS. NRSTS are often classified according to the normal tissue types from which they are derived. These types include various connective tissues, peripheral nervous system tissue, smooth muscle tissue, and vascular tissue. The classification also includes undifferentiated tumors that are not clearly related to specific tissue types. For more information about vascular tumors in children, see Childhood Vascular Tumors Treatment. The distribution of soft tissue sarcomas by histology and age, on the basis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program information from 2000 to 2015, is depicted in Table 1. The distribution of histological subtypes by age is also shown in Figure 2. NRSTS are more common in adolescents and adults.[6] Most of the information regarding treatment and natural history of the disease in younger patients has been based on studies in adult patients. The distributions of these tumors by age according to stage (Figure 1), histological subtype (Figure 2), and tumor site (Figure 3) are shown below.[7]EnlargeFigure 1.

The distribution of nonrhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcomas by age according to tumor site. Some genetic factors and external exposures have been associated with the development of NRSTS, including the following: Genetic factors:  Li-Fraumeni syndrome: Patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (usually resulting from  heritable cancer-associated changes of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene) have an increased risk of developing soft tissue tumors (mostly NRSTS), bone sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, and acute leukemia.[8,9]Familial adenomatous polyposis: Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis are at increased risk of developing desmoid-type fibromatosis.[10]RB1 gene: Germline mutations of the RB1 gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing soft tissue sarcoma, particularly leiomyosarcoma, and the risk appears higher  among those younger than 1 year who were treated with alkylating agents.[11,12]SMARCB1 gene: Germline mutations or deletions of the SMARCB1 (INI1) gene are associated with an increased risk of developing extrarenal rhabdoid tumors.[13] For more information about SMARCB1 and rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome type 1, see Rhabdoid Tumor Predisposition Syndrome Type 1.Neurofibromatosis type 1: Approximately 4% of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, which usually develop after a
long latency; some patients develop multiple lesions.[14-16]Werner syndrome: Werner syndrome is characterized by spontaneous chromosomal instability, resulting in increased susceptibility to cancer and premature aging. An excess of soft tissue sarcomas has been reported in patients with Werner syndrome.[17]Tuberous sclerosis complex: Tuberous sclerosis complex is associated with the development of various tumors showing perivascular epithelioid cell differentiation (PEComas), including lymphangioleiomyomatosis and hepatic and renal angiomyolipomas.[18-20]Adenosine deaminase–deficient severe combined immunodeficiency: Patients with adenosine deaminase–deficient severe combined immunodeficiency have been reported to be at increased risk of developing   multicentric dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, which usually presents at an average age of 8.9 years.[21] External exposures: Radiation: Some
NRSTS (particularly malignant fibrous
histiocytoma) can develop within a previously irradiated site.[22-26]Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in patients with AIDS: Some NRSTS (e.g.,
leiomyosarcoma) have been linked to EBV infection in patients
with AIDS.[22,27] Li-Fraumeni syndrome: Patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (usually resulting from  heritable cancer-associated changes of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene) have an increased risk of developing soft tissue tumors (mostly NRSTS), bone sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, and acute leukemia.[8,9] Familial adenomatous polyposis: Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis are at increased risk of developing desmoid-type fibromatosis.[10] RB1 gene: Germline mutations of the RB1 gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing soft tissue sarcoma, particularly leiomyosarcoma, and the risk appears higher  among those younger than 1 year who were treated with alkylating agents.[11,12] SMARCB1 gene: Germline mutations or deletions of the SMARCB1 (INI1) gene are associated with an increased risk of developing extrarenal rhabdoid tumors.[13] For more information about SMARCB1 and rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome type 1, see Rhabdoid Tumor Predisposition Syndrome Type 1. Neurofibromatosis type 1: Approximately 4% of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, which usually develop after a
long latency; some patients develop multiple lesions.[14-16] Werner syndrome: Werner syndrome is characterized by spontaneous chromosomal instability, resulting in increased susceptibility to cancer and premature aging. An excess of soft tissue sarcomas has been reported in patients with Werner syndrome.[17] Tuberous sclerosis complex: Tuberous sclerosis complex is associated with the development of various tumors showing perivascular epithelioid cell differentiation (PEComas), including lymphangioleiomyomatosis and hepatic and renal angiomyolipomas.[18-20] Adenosine deaminase–deficient severe combined immunodeficiency: Patients with adenosine deaminase–deficient severe combined immunodeficiency have been reported to be at increased risk of developing   multicentric dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, which usually presents at an average age of 8.9 years.[21] Radiation: Some
NRSTS (particularly malignant fibrous
histiocytoma) can develop within a previously irradiated site.[22-26] Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in patients with AIDS: Some NRSTS (e.g.,
leiomyosarcoma) have been linked to EBV infection in patients
with AIDS.[22,27] NRSTS can develop in any part of the body,  but they arise most commonly in the trunk and extremities.[28-30] Although rare, these tumors can arise in brain tissue and are treated according to the histological type.[31] NRSTS can present initially as an asymptomatic solid mass, or they may be symptomatic because of local invasion of adjacent anatomical structures. Systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss, and night sweats) are rare.
Hypoglycemia and hypophosphatemic rickets have been reported in cases of
hemangiopericytoma (now identified as a solitary fibrous tumor in the revised World Health Organization classification system), whereas hyperglycemia has been noted in patients with
fibrosarcoma of the lung.[32] When a suspicious lesion is identified, it is crucial that a complete workup, followed by adequate biopsy be performed. The lesion is imaged before initiating any intervention using the following procedures: Plain films. Plain films  can be used  to rule out bone involvement and detect calcifications that may be seen in soft tissue tumors such as extraskeletal osteosarcoma or synovial sarcoma. Computed tomography (CT). Chest CT is essential to assess the presence of metastases. An abdominal CT can be used to image intra-abdominal tumors, such as liposarcoma. Patients with NRSTS who were treated in 11 centers as part of the European paediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma Study Group (EpSSG) were retrospectively assessed to evaluate the impact of indeterminate pulmonary nodules identified on chest CT.[33]  Of the 206 patients examined, 109 (52.9%) did not have any nodules, 78 (38%) had at least one indeterminate nodule, and 19 (9.2%) had nodules meeting the definition of metastases.  The 5-year event-free survival  (EFS) rate was 78.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.4%–85.1%) for patients without nodules and 69.6% (95% CI, 57.9%–78.7%) for patients with indeterminate nodules (P = .135). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 87.4% (95% CI, 79.3%–92.5%) for patients without nodules and 79.0% (95% CI, 67.5%–86.8%) for patients with indeterminate nodules (P = .086). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI can be used to image  intra-abdominal tumors, such as liposarcoma, and is essential for extremity lesions. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan and bone scan. In a retrospective study, 46 PET scans were completed in 25 pediatric patients with soft tissue sarcoma.[34] The positive predictive value of finding metastatic disease was 89%, and  the negative predictive value was 67%. A small retrospective study of nine patients with NRSTS suggested that PET-CT was more accurate and cost-effective than either modality alone in identifying distant metastatic disease.[35] The use of this modality in pediatric NRSTS has not been studied prospectively. The imaging characteristics of some tumors can be highly suggestive of that particular diagnosis. For example, the imaging characteristics of pediatric low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma have been described and can aid in the diagnosis of these rare neoplasms.[36] Although NRSTS are pathologically
distinct from rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, the classification of childhood NRSTS type is often difficult. Core-needle biopsy, incisional biopsy, or excisional biopsy can be used to diagnose NRSTS. If possible, the surgeon who will perform the definitive resection needs to be involved in the biopsy decision. Poorly placed incisional or needle biopsies may adversely affect the ability to achieve negative margins. Needle biopsy techniques must ensure adequate tissue sampling. Given the diagnostic importance of translocations and other molecular changes, a core-needle biopsy or small incisional biopsy that obtains adequate tumor tissue is crucial to allow for  conventional
histological and immunocytochemical analysis and other studies such as light and electron microscopy, cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization,
and molecular pathology.[37,38] The acquisition of multiple cores of tissue may be required. Of 530 suspected soft tissue masses in (largely adult) patients who underwent core-needle biopsies, 426 (80%) were proven  to be soft tissue tumors, 225 (52.8%) of which were malignant. Core-needle biopsy was able to differentiate soft tissue sarcomas from benign lesions with a sensitivity of 96.3% and a specificity of 99.4%. Tumor subtype was accurately assigned in 89.5% of benign lesions and in 88% of soft tissue sarcomas. The biopsy complication rate was 0.4%.[39] Considerations related to a biopsy procedure are as follows: Core-needle biopsy for a deep-seated tumor can lead to formation of a hematoma, which affects subsequent resection and/or radiation (because the hematoma should be covered in the irradiated volume). Fine-needle biopsy is usually not recommended because it is difficult to determine the accurate histological diagnosis and grade of the tumor in this heterogeneous group of tumors. Image guidance using ultrasonography, CT scan, or MRI may be necessary to ensure a representative biopsy.[40] Image guidance is  particularly helpful in deep lesions and to avoid cystic changes or necrotic tumors.[41] Incisional biopsies must not compromise subsequent wide local excision. Excisional biopsy of the lesion is only appropriate for small superficial lesions (<3 cm in size) and are discouraged.[42,43] If an excisional biopsy is contemplated, then MRI of the area is recommended to define the area of involvement as subsequent surgery or radiation therapy may be needed. Various institutional series have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of sentinel node biopsy as a staging procedure in pediatric patients with soft tissue sarcomas.[44-49] The utility of sentinel node biopsy is currently limited to epithelioid sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, and trunk and extremity rhabdomyosarcoma.[50] In a prospective study of pediatric patients with sarcoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, 28 patients were examined. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive in 7 of  the 28 patients, including 3 patients (43%) who had negative PET-CT scans. PET-CT overestimated and suggested nodal involvement in 14 patients, more than what was confirmed by sentinel lymph node biopsy. The findings from the sentinel lymph node biopsies resulted in altering therapy for all seven   patients who were determined to have metastatic disease.  As indicated by previous reports, epithelioid sarcoma and clear cell sarcoma were the two NRSTS included in this study.[50] In the ARST0332 (NCT00346164) study, patients with epithelioid sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, or radiographically enlarged nodes underwent regional node sampling. Nodal metastases were identified in 20 patients (3.8%), and all but one of these patients had radiographic evidence of nodal involvement. The most common histologies included epithelioid sarcoma (18%), angiosarcoma (17%), and clear cell sarcoma (14%). Patients with isolated nodal metastases had a similar outcome to those who did not have distant metastases (5-year OS rates, 85% vs. 87%). Sentinel lymph node biopsies were encouraged but not required for this study.  A sentinel lymph node biopsy was not done in most patients because they had clinically enlarged nodes.  Of note, three patients without clinical evidence of lymph node metastasis at study entry experienced lymph node basin failure.  One of these patients had three lymph nodes in two different lymph node basins sampled by sentinel lymph node biopsy that were pathologically negative.[51]Transverse extremity incisions are avoided to reduce skin loss at re-excision and because they require a greater cross-sectional volume of tissue to be covered in the radiation field. Other extensive surgical procedures are also avoided before definitive diagnosis. In a prospective study of pediatric patients with sarcoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, 28 patients were examined. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive in 7 of  the 28 patients, including 3 patients (43%) who had negative PET-CT scans. PET-CT overestimated and suggested nodal involvement in 14 patients, more than what was confirmed by sentinel lymph node biopsy. The findings from the sentinel lymph node biopsies resulted in altering therapy for all seven   patients who were determined to have metastatic disease.  As indicated by previous reports, epithelioid sarcoma and clear cell sarcoma were the two NRSTS included in this study.[50] Transverse extremity incisions are avoided to reduce skin loss at re-excision and because they require a greater cross-sectional volume of tissue to be covered in the radiation field. Other extensive surgical procedures are also avoided before definitive diagnosis. For these reasons, open biopsy or multiple core-needle biopsies are strongly encouraged
so that adequate tumor tissue can be obtained to allow crucial
studies to be performed and to avoid limiting future treatment options. In children with unplanned resection of NRSTS, primary re-excision is frequently recommended because many patients will have tumor present in the re-excision specimen.[52,53] A single-institution analysis of adolescents and adults compared patients with unplanned excision of soft tissue sarcoma to stage-matched controls. In this retrospective analysis, unplanned initial excision of soft tissue sarcoma resulted in increased risk of local recurrence, metastasis, and death. This increased risk was greatest for high-grade tumors.[54][Level of evidence C1] In this case, a second resection is expected. Many NRSTS are
characterized by chromosomal abnormalities.  Some of these chromosomal
translocations lead to a fusion of two disparate genes.  The resulting fusion
transcript can be readily detected by using polymerase chain reaction–based
techniques, thus facilitating the diagnosis of those neoplasms that have
translocations. Some of the most frequent aberrations seen in
NRSTS are listed in Table 2. The prognosis of NRSTS varies greatly depending on the following factors:[71-73] Site of the primary tumor. Tumor size. Tumor grade. For more information, see the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Tumor Pathological Grading System section. Tumor histology. Depth of tumor invasion. Presence of metastases and site of the metastatic tumor. Resectability of the tumor. Use of radiation therapy. In a
review of a large adult series of NRSTS, patients with superficial extremity
sarcomas had a better prognosis than did patients with deep tumors.  Thus, in addition to grade
and size, the depth of invasion of the tumor should be considered.[74] Several adult and pediatric series have shown that
patients with large or invasive tumors have a significantly worse prognosis
than do those with small, noninvasive tumors. A retrospective review of soft tissue sarcomas in children and adolescents suggests that the 5 cm cutoff used for adults with soft tissue sarcoma may not be ideal for smaller children, especially infants. The review identified an interaction between tumor diameter and body surface area.[75] This relationship has been questioned and requires further study to determine the therapeutic implications of the observation.[76] Some pediatric NRSTS are associated with a better outcome.  For instance, patients with infantile fibrosarcoma who present at age 4 years or younger have an excellent prognosis. This excellent outcome occurs because surgery alone can cure a significant number of these patients  and infantile fibrosarcoma is highly chemosensitive. This tumor also responds well to larotrectinib, a specific tropomyosin receptor kinase inhibitor.[22,77] Soft tissue sarcomas in older children and adolescents often
behave similarly to those in adult patients.[22,78] A large, prospective, multinational COG  study (ARST0332 [NCT00346164]) enrolled newly diagnosed patients younger than 30 years. Patients were assigned to treatment on the basis of their risk group. Risk groups were defined by the presence of metastasis, tumor resectability and margins, and tumor size and grade. For more information, see Figure 4.[79][Level of evidence B4] EnlargeFigure 4.  Risk group and treatment assignment for the Children’s Oncology Group ARST0332 trial. Reprinted from The Lancet Oncology, Volume 21 (Issue 1), Spunt SL, Million L, Chi YY, et al., A risk-based treatment strategy for non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft-tissue sarcomas in patients younger than 30 years (ARST0332): a Children's Oncology Group prospective study, Pages 145–161, Copyright © 2020, with permission from Elsevier. Each patient was assigned to one of three risk groups and one of four treatment groups. The risk groups were as follows:[79] Low risk: Nonmetastatic R0 (resection was complete with negative microscopic margins) or R1 (microscopically positive margins) low-grade tumor, or ≤5 cm R1 high-grade tumor. Intermediate risk: Nonmetastatic R0 or R1 >5 cm high-grade tumor, or unresected tumor of any size or grade. High risk: Metastatic tumor. The treatment groups were as follows: Surgery alone (n = 205). Radiation therapy (55.8 Gy) (n = 17). Chemoradiation therapy (chemotherapy and 55.8 Gy radiation therapy) (n = 111). Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (chemotherapy and 45 Gy radiation therapy, then surgery and radiation therapy boost based on margins with continued chemotherapy) (n = 196). Chemotherapy included six cycles of ifosfamide (3 g/m2 per dose) administered intravenously on days 1 through 3 and five cycles of doxorubicin (37.5 mg/m2 per dose) administered intravenously on days 1 to 2 every 3 weeks, with the sequence adjusted on the basis of the timing of surgery or radiation therapy. For the 550 patients enrolled, 529 evaluable patients were included in the analysis; at a median follow-up of 6.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 4.9–7.9), the survival  results are shown in Table 3. Pediatric patients with unresected localized NRSTS have a poor outcome. Only about one-third of patients treated with multimodality therapy remain disease free.[71,80]; [81,82][Level of evidence C1] In an Italian review of 30 patients with NRSTS at visceral sites, only ten patients survived at 5 years. Unfavorable prognostic factors included inability to achieve complete resection, large tumor size, tumor invasion, histological subtype, and lung-pleura sites.[83][Level of evidence C1] The EpSSG conducted a prospective trial for patients younger than 21 years with NRSTS. They reported an analysis of 206 patients with synovial sarcoma and 363 with adult-type NRSTS. Patients were treated according to assigned risk groups. For more information, see Figure 5.[84] With a median follow-up of 80 months (interquartile range, 54.3–111.3) for the 467 surviving patients, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 73.7% (95% CI, 69.7%–77.2%), and the OS rate was 83.8% (95% CI, 80.3%–86.7%). The survival by treatment groups are shown in Table 4.[84] Overall, local control after radiation therapy was as follows: R0, 106 of 109 patients (97%); R1, 51 of 60 patients (85%); and R2/unresectable, 2 of 6 patients (33%). Local recurrence predictors included extent of delayed resection (P < .001), imaging response before delayed surgery (P < .001), histological subtype (P < .001), and no radiation therapy (P = .046). The 5-year EFS was significantly lower for patients unable to undergo R0 or R1 resection (P = .0003).[85] The authors concluded that adjuvant therapy could safely be omitted in the group of patients assigned to surgery alone. They also concluded that improving the outcome for patients with high-risk, initially resected, adult-type NRSTS and those with initially unresected disease remains a major clinical challenge.[84] In a pooled analysis from U.S. and European pediatric centers, outcome was better for patients whose tumor removal procedure was deemed complete than for patients whose tumor removal was incomplete. Outcome was better for patients who received radiation therapy than for patients who did not.[81][Level of evidence C1] Because 
long-term morbidity must be minimized while disease-free survival is maximized, the ideal therapy for each patient must be
carefully and individually determined using these prognostic factors before
initiating therapy.[29,86-90] Smith MA, Altekruse SF, Adamson PC, et al.: Declining childhood and adolescent cancer mortality.

In the United States, it has been adopted by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) for sarcoma staging and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) cancer protocols for bone and soft tissue sarcomas. The WHO published a revision to their classification of soft tissue and bone tumors in 2020.  The classification had several updates to existing classification, nomenclature, grading, and risk stratification schemes.   The revised classification includes newly described entities, and it uses molecular alterations in the classifications.[1] The grading of soft tissue tumors has always been a controversial issue. The 2020 WHO classification represents the consensus of several soft tissue pathologists and geneticists, as well as a medical oncologist, radiologist, and surgeon. This edition further integrates morphological and genetic information into the classification. For example, a new category of tumors called NTRK-rearranged spindle cell neoplasms was included, but infantile fibrosarcoma was excluded from this group. Ewing sarcoma was removed from the bone tumor section and, instead, is in the undifferentiated small cell sarcomas of bone and soft tissue section. This classification reflects the variable presentation sites and the variety of translocations seen in Ewing sarcoma. This classification also separated Ewing sarcoma from entities such as CIC-rearranged sarcomas, BCOR-rearranged sarcomas, and EWSR1 gene fusions involving non-ETS partner genes.[1] Adipocytic tumors.Benign.Lipoma not otherwise specified (NOS).Lipomatosis.Lipomatosis of nerve.Lipoblastomatosis.Angiolipoma NOS.Myolipoma.Chondroid lipoma.Spindle cell lipoma.Atypical spindle cell/pleomorphic lipomatous tumor.Hibernoma.Intermediate (locally aggressive).Atypical lipomatous tumor.Malignant.Liposarcoma, well-differentiated, NOS.Dedifferentiated liposarcoma.Myxoid liposarcoma.Pleomorphic liposarcoma.Myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma.

With the increased use of next-generation sequencing techniques and heightened awareness of recently approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target NTRK and other genes, newer subgroups of pediatric soft tissue lesions that are characterized by kinase fusions have been  identified and share a similar morphological spectrum. Identifying these rare entities is important because some of them might be amenable to therapeutic targeting with novel agents.  Some examples of these lesions are described below.[4] Lipofibromatosis-like neural tumors are superficial tumors that commonly affect children, and the cells are immunoreactive for S100. These tumors commonly have NTRK1 fusions but rarely harbor RET or ALK fusions. Spindle cell tumors with S100 and CD34 positivity that resemble intermediate-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors predominate in children and young adults  and can affect bone and soft tissues. They have fusions in various genes, including RAF1, BRAF, NTRK1, and NTRK2. Infantile fibrosarcoma–like lesions morphologically resemble infantile fibrosarcoma and most commonly affect patients younger than 2 years. They have a predilection for intraabdominal sites. They often exhibit alternate fusions, involving genes such as BRAF, NTRK1, and MET. Spindle cell sarcomas with hemangiopericytic and myopericytic patterns can affect children and have NTRK1 fusions. RAF1 fusion–positive spindle cell sarcomas can be seen in children and adults and often arise in the trunk. They rarely behave aggressively. BRAF fusion–positive soft tissue tumors have been associated with infantile fibrosarcoma–like variants or spindle cell sarcomas that resemble malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. They have been reported in children and often involve the abdominal cavity. RET fusion–positive tumors predominantly affect children and have a similar phenotype to NTRK fusion–positive tumors. They can display fibroblastic and neural-like differentiation. These tumors are sensitive to the highly selective small-molecule RET inhibitor selpercatinib.[5] WHO Classification of Tumours Editorial Board: WHO Classification of Tumours.

determining the most effective therapy for pediatric soft tissue sarcomas.  As
yet, there is no well-accepted staging system that is applicable to all
childhood sarcomas. The system from the American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) that is used for adults has not been validated in pediatric studies. Although a standardized staging system for pediatric nonrhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) does not exist, two
systems are currently in use for staging pediatric NRSTS:[1] Surgico-pathological staging system: The surgico-pathological staging system used by the Intergroup
Rhabdomyosarcoma Study is based on the amount, or extent, of tumor that remains
after initial surgery and whether the disease has metastasized. This staging system was used in early pediatric trials.[2]
For more information, see the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Staging System section. TNM staging system: The TNM staging system  is a collaborative effort between the AJCC (United States) and  the International Union Against Cancer (worldwide). Staging is based on the extent of the tumor (T), the extent of spread to the lymph nodes (N), the presence of metastasis (M), and the tumor grade. For the staging of soft tissue sarcoma from the eighth edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, see Tables 5, 6, 7, and 8.[3-7] The last Children's Oncology Group (COG) trial used the sixth edition AJCC Cancer Staging Manual for soft tissue sarcoma (with central pathology review).[1] A review of children with NRSTS was performed with data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and identified 941 patients between 1988 and 2007.[8]  The COG risk stratification was validated in this cohort. Group I: Localized tumor completely resected with histologically negative margins. Group II: Grossly resected tumor with microscopic residual tumor at the margin(s) and/or extension into regional lymph nodes.
Group IIA: Localized, grossly resected tumor with microscopic residual disease.Group IIB: Regional disease with involved nodes completely resected with no microscopic disease. The most proximal (to the patient, most distal to the tumor) regional lymph node must be negative.Group IIC: Regional disease with involved nodes grossly resected but with evidence of residual microscopic disease at the primary site and/or histologic involvement of the most proximal regional lymph node in the dissection. Group III: Localized tumor, incompletely resected, or biopsy only, with gross residual tumor. Group IIA: Localized, grossly resected tumor with microscopic residual disease. Group IIB: Regional disease with involved nodes completely resected with no microscopic disease. The most proximal (to the patient, most distal to the tumor) regional lymph node must be negative. Group IIC: Regional disease with involved nodes grossly resected but with evidence of residual microscopic disease at the primary site and/or histologic involvement of the most proximal regional lymph node in the dissection. Group IV: Any localized or regional tumor with distant metastases present   
at the time of diagnosis.
This includes the presence of malignant cells in effusions (pleural, peritoneal) and/or cerebrospinal fluid (rare). Any soft tissue sarcoma that  recurs after initial treatment or progresses after radiation therapy, 
chemotherapy, or initial surgery. The eighth edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual has designated staging by  the
four criteria of tumor size, nodal status, histological grade, and metastasis and by anatomic primary tumor site (head and neck; trunk and extremities; abdomen and thoracic visceral organs; retroperitoneum; and unusual histologies and sites) (see Tables 5, 6, 7, and 8).[3-7] For information about unusual histologies and sites, see the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual.[7] In most cases of soft tissue sarcomas, accurate histopathological classification alone does not yield optimal information about their clinical
behavior.  Therefore, several histological parameters are evaluated in the grading process, including the following: Degree of
cellularity. Cellular pleomorphism. Mitotic activity. Degree of necrosis. Invasive growth. This process
is used to improve the correlation between histological findings and clinical
outcome.[9]  In children, grading of soft tissue sarcoma is complicated by certain factors, such as prognosis, patient age, extent of surgical resection, and ability to metastasize. For example,  children younger than 4 years with infantile fibrosarcoma and hemangiopericytoma have a good prognosis, and angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans can recur locally if incompletely excised but usually do not metastasize. Testing the validity of a grading system within the pediatric population is
difficult because of the rarity of these neoplasms.  In March 1986, the Pediatric
Oncology Group (POG) conducted a prospective study on pediatric NRSTS and devised the POG grading system.  Analysis of outcome for patients with localized NRSTS demonstrated that patients with grade 3
tumors fared significantly worse than those with grade 1 or grade 2
lesions.  This finding suggests that this system can accurately predict the
clinical behavior of NRSTS.[9-11] The POG and Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre Le Cancer (FNCLCC) grading systems have proven to be of prognostic value in
pediatric and adult NRSTS.[12-16] The COG uses the FNCLCC clinically. In a study of 130 tumors from  children and adolescents with NRSTS enrolled in three prospective clinical trials, a correlation was found between the POG-assigned grade and the FNCLCC-assigned grade. However, grading did not correlate in all cases; 44 patients whose tumors received discrepant grades (POG grade 3, FNCLCC grade 1 or 2) had outcomes between concurrent grade 3 and grades 1 and 2. A mitotic index of 10 or greater emerged as an important prognostic factor.[17] The COG ARST0332 (NCT00346164) trial compared the POG and FNCLCC pathological grading systems as part of a prospective risk-based strategy. The study found that, in addition to tumor depth and invasiveness, the FNCLCC grade was strongly associated with event-free survival and overall survival.[18] The closed COG ARST1321 (NCT02180867) trial used the FNCLCC system to assign histological grade. The FNCLCC  Sarcoma Group is described below. The POG grading system is no longer used. The FNCLCC histological grading system was developed for adults with soft tissue sarcoma. The purpose of the grading system is to predict which patients will develop metastasis and subsequently benefit from postoperative chemotherapy.[19,20] For information about the FNCLCC histological grading system for adults, see the FNCLCC histological grade section in Soft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment.

sarcomas (NRSTS), treatment should be coordinated by a multidisciplinary team that includes oncologists (pediatric or medical), pathologists, surgeons, and radiation oncologists for all children, adolescents, and young adults with these tumors.  In addition, to better define the tumors' natural
history and response to therapy, entry into national or institutional
treatment protocols should be considered for children with rare neoplasms. 
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) performed a prospective nonrandomized trial (ARST0332 [NCT00346164]) for patients with soft tissue sarcomas.[1] Surgical resection of the primary tumor was classified as follows: R0 if the resection was complete with negative microscopic margins. R1 if the margins were microscopically positive. R2 if the resection left macroscopic residual tumor. Patients were assigned to one of the following  three risk groups: Low risk: Nonmetastatic R0 or R1 low-grade, or ≤5 cm R1 high-grade tumor. Intermediate risk: Nonmetastatic R0 or R1 >5 cm high-grade, or unresected tumor of any size or grade. High risk: Metastatic tumor. The treatment groups were as follows: Surgery alone. Radiation therapy (55.8 Gy). Chemoradiation therapy (chemotherapy and 55.8 Gy radiation therapy). Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (chemotherapy and 45 Gy radiation therapy, then surgery and radiation therapy boost based on margins with continued chemotherapy). Chemotherapy included six cycles of intravenous (IV) ifosfamide (3 g/m2 per dose) on days 1 through 3 and five cycles of IV doxorubicin (37.5 mg/m2 per dose) on days 1 to 2 every 3 weeks, with the sequence adjusted on the basis of timing of surgery or radiation therapy. The analysis included 529  evaluable patients: low risk (n = 222), intermediate risk (n  = 227), and high risk (n = 80). Patients underwent surgery alone (n = 205), radiation therapy (n = 17), chemoradiation therapy (n = 111), and neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (n = 196). At a median follow-up of 6.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 4.9–7.9), the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates, by risk group, were as follows: Low-risk group: EFS rate, 88.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84.0%–93.8%) and OS rate, 96.2% (95% CI, 93.2%–99.2%). Intermediate-risk group: EFS rate, 65.0% (95% CI, 58.2%–71.8%) and OS rate, 79.2% (95% CI, 73.4%–85.0%). High-risk group: EFS rate, 21.2% (95% CI, 11.4%–31.1%) and OS rate, 35.5% (95% CI, 23.6%–47.4%). The authors concluded that pretreatment clinical features can be used to effectively define treatment failure risk and stratify young patients with NRSTS for risk-adapted therapy. Most low-risk patients can be cured without adjuvant therapy, avoiding known long-term treatment complications. Survival remains suboptimal for intermediate-risk and high-risk patients, and novel therapies are needed for these patients. Surgical resection of the primary tumor is the predominant therapy for most NRSTS. In the COG ARST0332 (NCT00346164) study, approximately 37% of patients younger than 30 years were treated with surgery alone.[1] Another 36% of patients had surgical resection after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. Involvement of a surgeon with special expertise in the resection of soft tissue sarcomas is highly desirable. After an appropriate biopsy and pathological diagnosis, every attempt is made to resect the primary tumor. Completeness of resection predicts outcome. In the COG ARST0332 study, complete resections with negative microscopic margins (R0) resulted in the best outcomes.[1] The 5-year EFS rates for patients treated with surgery and other modalities were the following:84% for patients who had R0 resections.66% for patients who had R1  resections.49% for patients who had R2  resections. The 5-year OS rates for patients treated with surgery and other modalities were the following:93% for patients who had R0 resections.80% for patients who had R1  resections.63% for patients who had R2 resections. The 5-year EFS rates for patients treated with surgery only were the following:96% for patients with low-grade tumors who had R0 resections.81% for patients with low-grade tumors who had R1 resections.84% for patients with high-grade tumors that were smaller than 5 cm and had R0 resections. 84% for patients who had R0 resections. 66% for patients who had R1  resections. 49% for patients who had R2  resections. 93% for patients who had R0 resections. 80% for patients who had R1  resections. 63% for patients who had R2 resections. 96% for patients with low-grade tumors who had R0 resections. 81% for patients with low-grade tumors who had R1 resections. 84% for patients with high-grade tumors that were smaller than 5 cm and had R0 resections. The timing of surgery depends on an assessment of the feasibility and morbidity of surgery.  In the COG ARST0332 study, the outcomes were nearly identical for intermediate-risk patients who achieved an R0 or R1 resection with up-front surgery or surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (70% vs. 71%, respectively). An R0 resection was more likely to occur after neoadjuvant therapy.[1] These observations are true even for high-grade tumors, where ability to achieve R0 or R1 resection was the major predictor of EFS. Treatment with neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy resulted in lower doses of radiation therapy and achieved greater rates of R0 resection.[2] Resectability should be determined at the time of diagnosis, with an emphasis on achieving negative margins without loss of form or function. If the initial operation
fails to achieve pathologically negative tissue margins or if the initial surgery was done without the knowledge that cancer was present, a re-excision of the affected area
is performed to obtain clear, but not necessarily wide, margins.[3-6]  This surgical tenet is true even if no mass is detected by magnetic resonance imaging after initial  surgery.[7]; [8][Level of evidence C1] Regional lymph node metastases at diagnosis are unusual and are most often seen in patients with epithelioid and clear cell sarcomas.[9,10] Sentinel lymph node biopsy as a staging procedure in soft tissue sarcoma remains controversial. However, it may help manage selected cases in adults with clear cell sarcoma and epithelioid sarcoma. There are insufficient data to support the use  of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the management of pediatric patients with other NRSTS.[11-16] Considerations for radiation therapy are based on the potential for surgery, with or without chemotherapy, to obtain local control without loss of critical organs or significant functions, or causing cosmetic or psychological impairment.  This will vary according to the following: Patient variables (e.g., age and sex). Tumor variables (e.g., histopathology, site, size, and grade). Use of surgery and margin status. Expectations for radiation-induced morbidities (e.g., impaired bone or muscle development, organ damage, or subsequent neoplasm). Radiation therapy can be given preoperatively or postoperatively. It can also be used as definitive therapy in rare situations  in which surgical resection is not performed.[17] Radiation field size and dose will be based on patient and tumor variables and the surgical procedure.[18] Radiation therapy was associated with improved OS compared with surgery alone when delivered preoperatively or postoperatively.[19] Brachytherapy and
intraoperative  radiation may be applicable in select
situations.[20-22]; [23][Level of evidence C2] Preoperative radiation therapy has been associated with
excellent local control rates.[24-26] The advantages of this approach include treating smaller tissue volumes without the need to treat a postsurgical bed and somewhat lower radiation doses because relative hypoxia from surgical disruption of vasculature and scarring is not present. Preoperative radiation therapy has been associated with an increased  rate of wound complications in adults, primarily in lower extremity tumors; however, the degree of these complications is questionable.[27] Conversely, preoperative radiation therapy may lead to less fibrosis than with postoperative approaches, perhaps because of the smaller treatment volume and dose.[28] Radiation technique can impact normal tissue sparing. Compared with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy offers the potential to decrease radiation dose to skin and epiphysis when irradiating extremity sarcomas.[29] Radiation therapy can also be given postoperatively. In general, radiation is indicated for patients with inadequate surgical margins and for larger, high-grade tumors.[30,31]  This is particularly important in high-grade tumors with
tumor margins smaller than 1 cm.[32,33]; [34][Level of evidence C3]  With combined R0 (negative margin) surgery and radiation therapy, local control of the primary tumor can be achieved in about 90%
of patients with extremity sarcomas, 70% to 75% of patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas, and 80% of patients overall.[20,35-38] Retroperitoneal sarcomas are unique in that the radiosensitivity of the bowel increases the risk of injury and makes postoperative radiation therapy less desirable.[39,40]  Postoperative adhesions and bowel immobility can increase the risk of damage from any given radiation dose.   This contrasts with the preoperative approach in which the tumor often displaces bowel outside of the radiation field, and any exposed bowel is more mobile, which decreases exposure to specific bowel segments. Radiation volume and dose depend on the patient, tumor, and surgical variables noted above, as well as the following: Patient age and growth potential. Ability to avoid critical organs, epiphyseal plates, and lymphatics (but not the neurovascular bundles that are relatively radiation tolerant). Functional/cosmetic outcome. Radiation doses are typically 45 Gy to 50 Gy preoperatively, with consideration for postoperative boost of 10 Gy to 20 Gy if resection margins are microscopically or grossly positive, or planned brachytherapy if the resection is predicted to be subtotal. In addition, even in the preoperative setting, an additional boost of radiation at a dose of 60 Gy can be considered for areas of the tumor predicted to be at risk of residual microscopic disease (e.g., areas of tumor adjacent to critical normal tissues) that cannot be resected with adequate margins. This can be accomplished with a simultaneously integrated boost dose (i.e., higher dose area within the larger lower dose volume) or administered with a small field of radiation after the initial volume is treated with a dose of 45 Gy to 50 Gy. However, data documenting the efficacy of a postoperative boost to areas with microscopically positive margins are lacking.[41] The postoperative radiation dose is 55 Gy to 60 Gy for R0 resections, up to 65 Gy for R1 resections (microscopic positive margins), and higher when unresectable gross residual disease exists, depending on overall treatment goals (e.g., definitive local control vs. palliation). The Children's Oncology Group analyzed local recurrence (LR) for NRSTS after radiation therapy in patients treated on ARST0332.[2]  Patients younger than 30 years with high-grade NRSTS received radiation therapy (55.8 Gy) for an R1, 5 cm or smaller tumor (arm B); radiation therapy (55.8 Gy) with chemotherapy for an R0/R1, larger than 5 cm tumor (arm C); or neoadjuvant radiation therapy (45 Gy) with chemotherapy plus delayed surgery, chemotherapy, and postoperative boost to 10.8 Gy for an R0, smaller than 5 mm margins tumor or R1 tumor, or 19.8 Gy for R2 or unresected tumors (arm D). Of 193 eligible patients, 24 had local recurrences (arm B: 1 of 15 [6.7%], arm C: 7 of 65 [10.8%], arm D: 16 of 113 [14.2%]) with a  median time to local recurrence of 1.1 years (range, 0.11–5.27). Of 95 patients eligible for delayed surgery after neoadjuvant therapy, 89 (93.7%) achieved R0/R1 margins. Overall local control after radiation therapy were as follows: R0, 106 of 109 (97%); R1, 51 of 60 (85%); and R2/unresectable, 2 of 6 (33%). The authors concluded that risk-based treatment for young patients with high-grade NRSTS treated on ARST0332 produced very high local control, particularly after R0 resection (97%), despite lower-than-standard radiation therapy doses. Radiation margins are typically 2 cm to 4 cm longitudinally and encompass fascial planes axially.[42,43] The role of postoperative chemotherapy remains unclear.[44] Evidence (lack of clarity regarding postoperative chemotherapy): A meta-analysis of data from  all randomized trials of adults with soft tissue sarcoma observed the following:[45]Recurrence-free survival was better with postoperative chemotherapy for patients with high-grade tumors larger than 5 cm. In a European trial, adults with completely resected soft tissue sarcoma were randomly assigned to observation or postoperative chemotherapy with ifosfamide and doxorubicin.[46][Level of evidence A1] Postoperative chemotherapy was not associated with improved EFS or OS.It is difficult to extrapolate this trial to pediatric patients because the trial included: (1) a wide variety of histologies; (2) a relatively low dose of ifosfamide; (3) patients assigned to chemotherapy had definitive radiation delayed until completion of chemotherapy; and (4) almost one-half of the patients in the trial had intermediate-grade tumors.In the discussion section, the authors merged their patients with previously published series, including those from the European meta-analysis, and concluded that the results suggested a benefit for postoperative chemotherapy. The
largest prospective pediatric trial failed to  demonstrate any benefit   with postoperative
 vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin.[35] Doxorubicin and ifosfamide were used in the risk-based COG ARST0332 (NCT00346164) trial.[1][Level of evidence C1] Although this was not a randomized study, results at 2.6 years showed that patients with high-risk (>5 cm and high grade), grossly resected, nonmetastatic tumors who were treated with radiation therapy and postoperative doxorubicin and ifosfamide had a 5-year EFS rate of 67.2% and an OS rate of 78%.In patients with metastatic disease treated with preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the estimated 5-year EFS rate was 21.2%, and the OS rate was 35.5%. Recurrence-free survival was better with postoperative chemotherapy for patients with high-grade tumors larger than 5 cm. Postoperative chemotherapy was not associated with improved EFS or OS. It is difficult to extrapolate this trial to pediatric patients because the trial included: (1) a wide variety of histologies; (2) a relatively low dose of ifosfamide; (3) patients assigned to chemotherapy had definitive radiation delayed until completion of chemotherapy; and (4) almost one-half of the patients in the trial had intermediate-grade tumors. In the discussion section, the authors merged their patients with previously published series, including those from the European meta-analysis, and concluded that the results suggested a benefit for postoperative chemotherapy. Although this was not a randomized study, results at 2.6 years showed that patients with high-risk (>5 cm and high grade), grossly resected, nonmetastatic tumors who were treated with radiation therapy and postoperative doxorubicin and ifosfamide had a 5-year EFS rate of 67.2% and an OS rate of 78%. In patients with metastatic disease treated with preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the estimated 5-year EFS rate was 21.2%, and the OS rate was 35.5%. The use of angiogenesis and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors has been explored in the treatment of adult soft tissue sarcomas but not in pediatrics. Evidence (targeted therapy in adults with soft tissue sarcoma): In a trial of 711 adult patients who achieved a response or stable disease after chemotherapy, patients were randomly assigned to receive ridaforolimus or placebo.[47]The administration of ridaforolimus was associated with a 3-week improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with placebo. In another trial of 371 randomly assigned adult patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma that progressed after chemotherapy, pazopanib was compared with placebo.[48] The median PFS for the pazopanib arm was 4.6 months compared with 1.6 months for the placebo arm. OS was not different between the two arms. In a study of 182 previously treated adult patients with recurrent liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and other sarcomas, patients were randomly assigned to receive regorafenib or placebo.[49]Patients with nonadipocytic tumors who were treated with regorafenib had significant improvements in PFS when compared with patients who were treated with placebo. The administration of ridaforolimus was associated with a 3-week improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with placebo. The median PFS for the pazopanib arm was 4.6 months compared with 1.6 months for the placebo arm. OS was not different between the two arms. Patients with nonadipocytic tumors who were treated with regorafenib had significant improvements in PFS when compared with patients who were treated with placebo. The COG and NRG Oncology cancer consortia conducted a randomized trial of pazopanib added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (doxorubicin and ifosfamide) and preoperative radiation therapy in pediatric and adult patients with NRSTS.  Patients whose tumors were larger than 5 cm and   had intermediate- or high-grade disease were eligible.  The end point of the trial was pathological tumor response after adjuvant therapy.  Study entry was closed early because the planned interim analysis showed that the pathological response boundary was crossed.  Eighty-one patients were enrolled, but only 42 (52%) were available for response data (17 patients from each group discontinued therapy for either progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient or physician choice).[50] Four of 18 patients (22%) in the control group had greater than 90% necrosis at resection, compared with 14 of 24 patients (58%) in the group treated with pazopanib, meeting the criteria for early stopping of the study. Toxicity was greater in the pazopanib group, mainly resulting from increased myelosuppression.  Wound complications were also more frequent in the pazopanib group. With longer follow-up, the investigators were able to analyze the secondary objectives of OS and EFS.[51] At a median follow-up of 3.3 years (range, 0.1–5.8 years), the 3-year EFS rate for all patients in the intent-to-treat analysis was 52.5% for patients who received pazopanib and 50.6% for those who did not (log-rank P = .8677). The 3-year OS rate was 75.7% for patients who received pazopanib and 65.4% for the control group (log-rank P = .1919).

cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills of the following health care professionals and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation that will achieve optimal survival and quality of life: Primary care physicians. Pediatric surgical specialists. Pediatric radiation oncologists. Pediatric medical oncologists/hematologists. Rehabilitation specialists. Pediatric nurse specialists. Social workers. Child life professionals. Psychologists. For information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on Supportive and Palliative Care. The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for pediatric cancer
centers and their role in the treatment of pediatric patients with cancer.[2]  At these pediatric
cancer centers, clinical trials are available for most types of cancer
that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity to participate is offered to most patients and families.  Multidisciplinary evaluation in pediatric cancer centers that have surgical and radiotherapeutic expertise is of critical importance to ensure the best clinical outcome for these patients. Although surgery with or without radiation therapy can be curative for a significant proportion of patients, the addition of chemotherapy might benefit subsets of children with the disease; therefore, enrollment into clinical trials is encouraged. Clinical trials for
children and adolescents with cancer are generally designed to compare
potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. 
Most of the progress made in identifying curative therapies for
childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.  Information about
ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Many therapeutic strategies for children and adolescents with soft tissue tumors are
similar to those for adult patients, although there are important differences. 
For example, the biology of the neoplasm in pediatric patients may differ
dramatically from that of the adult lesion.  Additionally, limb-sparing procedures are more
difficult to perform in pediatric patients.  The morbidity associated with radiation therapy, particularly in infants and young children, may be much greater than that observed in
adults.[3] Improved outcomes with multimodality therapy in adults and children with soft tissue sarcomas over the past 20 years has caused increasing concern about the potential long-term side effects of this therapy
in children, especially when considering the expected longer life span of children versus adults. Therefore, to
maximize tumor control and minimize long-term morbidity, treatment must be
individualized for children and adolescents with nonrhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcoma.  These patients should be enrolled in prospective studies that
accurately assess any potential complications.[4] Smith MA, Altekruse SF, Adamson PC, et al.: Declining childhood and adolescent cancer mortality.

Liposarcoma, Well-Differentiated, Not Otherwise Specified (NOS)Clinical presentationHistopathological classificationGenomic alterationsPrognosisTreatment of liposarcoma Clinical presentation Histopathological classification Genomic alterations Prognosis Treatment of liposarcoma Adipocytic tumors account for less than 10% of soft tissue lesions in patients younger than 20 years. The most common adipocytic tumors in children are lipomas and lipoblastomas. Table 9  summarizes the adipocytic neoplasms seen in pediatric patients and includes information about their corresponding clinico-pathological and molecular features.[1] Liposarcoma is rare in the pediatric population and accounts for 3% of soft tissue sarcoma in patients younger than 20 years  (see Table 1). In a review of 182 pediatric patients with adult-type sarcomas, only 14 had a diagnosis of liposarcoma.[7]  One retrospective study identified 34 patients younger than 22 years  from 1960 to 2011.[8]  There were roughly equal numbers of male and female patients, and the median age was 18 years. In an international clinico-pathological review, the characteristics of 82 cases of pediatric liposarcoma were reported.[9] The median age was 15.5 years, and females were more commonly affected.  In both reports, most patients had myxoid liposarcoma.[8,9] A literature review of 275 cases of pediatric liposarcoma showed that:[10] Myxoid liposarcoma was the most common histology  (68%), followed by well-differentiated liposarcoma (10.5%). Twelve percent of patients died of disease, and most of the deaths occurred in patients with the pleomorphic and myxoid pleomorphic subtypes. About 70% of patients with myxoid and well-differentiated liposarcoma were treated with surgery only. The overall clinical outcomes for these groups  of patients were excellent, with no evidence of disease in 114 of 127 patients. In contrast, more than 50% of patients with pleomorphic  liposarcoma received radiation therapy and chemotherapy in addition to surgery, and their clinical outcome was suboptimal, with no evidence of disease in only 5 of 10 patients. Germline TP53 mutations were seen in two  patients with myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma and two patients with well-differentiated liposarcoma who had a family history compatible with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Most liposarcomas in the pediatric and adolescent age range are low grade and located subcutaneously.  Metastasis to lymph nodes is uncommon, and most metastases are pulmonary.  Tumors arising in the periphery are more likely to be low grade and myxoid.  Tumors arising centrally are more likely to be high grade, pleomorphic, and present with metastasis or recur with metastasis. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification for liposarcoma is as follows:[11] Intermediate (locally aggressive).Atypical lipomatous tumor. These tumors do not metastasize unless they undergo dedifferentiation. Malignant.Dedifferentiated liposarcoma.Myxoid liposarcoma. Pure myxoid liposarcomas are characterized by a t(12;16)(q13;p11) translocation and can metastasize but usually have an excellent outcome in the absence of a round cell component.[12] Myxoid liposarcoma is the most common subtype of liposarcoma in the pediatric population.[8,9]Pleomorphic liposarcoma. This is an uncommon type of liposarcoma and primarily arises in older adults.Myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma. This rare entity occurs primarily in children, adolescents, and young adults. It commonly presents in the mediastinum and is clinically aggressive.Liposarcoma, well-differentiated, NOS. Atypical lipomatous tumor. These tumors do not metastasize unless they undergo dedifferentiation. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Myxoid liposarcoma. Pure myxoid liposarcomas are characterized by a t(12;16)(q13;p11) translocation and can metastasize but usually have an excellent outcome in the absence of a round cell component.[12] Myxoid liposarcoma is the most common subtype of liposarcoma in the pediatric population.[8,9] Pleomorphic liposarcoma. This is an uncommon type of liposarcoma and primarily arises in older adults. Myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma. This rare entity occurs primarily in children, adolescents, and young adults. It commonly presents in the mediastinum and is clinically aggressive. Liposarcoma, well-differentiated, NOS. Atypical lipomatous tumor. This entity is characterized by supernumerary ring and giant marker chromosomes that contain chromosomal region 12q14-q15, which includes MDM2. MDM2 amplification can be detected in virtually all cases of atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma, with nearby genes such as CDK4 and FRS2 commonly being coamplified with MDM2.[13] Dedifferentiated liposarcoma. This entity, like atypical lipomatous tumor, is characterized by MDM2 amplification and the supernumerary ring and giant marker chromosomes containing the chromosomal region 12q14-q15. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma contains a high number of segmental copy number alterations, but has few gene mutations.[14] Myxoid liposarcoma. This  entity is characterized by the t(12;16)(q13;p11) translocation that produces the FUS::DDIT3 gene fusion.[14]  In a small percentage of cases, EWSR1 substitutes for FUS, producing the EWSR1::DDIT3 gene fusion (t(12;22)(q13;q12)). DDIT3 (previously called CHOP and GADD153) is a stress-induced gene that has an inhibitory effect on adipogenesis.[15] Myxoid liposarcoma is the most common subtype of liposarcoma in the pediatric population. Most pediatric cases show the FUS::DDIT3 gene fusion.[8,9,16] Pleomorphic liposarcoma. This entity is primarily a disease of older adults and lacks either DDIT3 gene rearrangements or MDM2 amplification. Cases of pleomorphic liposarcoma typically have multiple chromosomal imbalances, including mutations in TP53 and NF1 observed in some cases.[17] Myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma. This entity most commonly presents in the adolescent and young adult population and lacks the DDIT3 gene rearrangement of myxoid liposarcoma and the MDM2 amplification of atypical lipomatous tumor and dedifferentiated liposarcoma.[9,16,18] Instead, myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma presents with multiple chromosomal gains and losses. Loss of Rb expression is commonly observed, sometimes in association with loss of chromosome 13q14 where RB1 is located.[18,19] Although most cases of myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma lack TP53 mutations, a minority have TP53 mutations that are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome in some cases.[20-22] Higher grade or central tumors are associated with a significantly higher risk of death.  In an international retrospective review, the 5-year survival rate was 42% for patients with central tumors. Seven of ten patients with pleomorphic myxoid liposarcoma died of their disease.[9]  In a retrospective study of 14 patients, the 5-year survival rate was 78%. Tumor grade, histological subtype, and primary location correlated with survival.[8] Treatment options for liposarcoma include the following: Surgery. If the tumor is not completely removed or locally recurs, a second surgery may be performed.[23-25] Chemotherapy followed by surgery. Surgery and radiation therapy (evidence based on adult studies).[26,27] Targeted therapy (evidence based on adult studies).[28] Surgery is the most important treatment for liposarcoma.  After complete surgical resection of well-differentiated or myxoid liposarcoma, the event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates are roughly 90%.[29] If initial surgery is incomplete, re-excision should be performed to achieve a wide margin of resection.[23-25]  Local recurrences have been seen and are controlled with a second resection of the tumor, particularly for low-grade liposarcomas. Chemotherapy has been used to decrease the size of liposarcoma before surgery to facilitate complete resection, particularly in central tumors.[30,31]  The role of postoperative chemotherapy for liposarcoma is poorly defined.  Postoperative therapy for completely resected myxoid liposarcomas does not appear to be needed.  Even with the use of postoperative chemotherapy, the survival of patients with pleomorphic liposarcomas remains poor.[32] There are very limited data to support the use of trabectedin in pediatric patients.[33] Trabectedin has produced encouraging responses in adults with advanced myxoid liposarcoma.[34] In one study, adult patients with recurrent liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma were randomly assigned to treatment with either trabectedin or dacarbazine. Patients treated with trabectedin had a 45%  reduction in disease progression.[35][Level of evidence B1] Treatment with eribulin, a nontaxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor, significantly improved survival in adult patients with recurrent liposarcoma compared with dacarbazine. The median OS was 15.6 months for patients who received eribulin, versus 8.4 months for patients who received dacarbazine. Survival differences were more pronounced in patients with dedifferentiated and pleomorphic liposarcoma. Eribulin was effective in prolonging survival of patients with either high-grade or intermediate-grade tumors.[36][Level of evidence A1] A pediatric phase I trial of eribulin did not accrue any patients with liposarcoma.[37] Radiation therapy is also considered either preoperatively or postoperatively depending on the cosmetic/functional consequences of additional surgery and radiation therapy.[38,39] In a phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, 41 adult patients with unresectable or metastatic  high-grade or intermediate-grade liposarcoma were treated with pazopanib at a dose of 800 mg daily.[28][Level of evidence B4] The progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 12 weeks was 68.3%, which was significantly greater  than the null hypothesis value of 40%. Forty-four percent of patients experienced tumor control. One patient had a partial response, and 17 patients had stable disease. At 24 weeks, 39% of the patients remained progression free. The median PFS was 4.4 months, and median OS was 12.6 months. Putra J, Al-Ibraheemi A: Adipocytic tumors in Children: A contemporary review.

Osteosarcoma, extraskeletal. Osseous and chondromatous neoplasms account for 0.8% of soft tissue sarcomas in patients younger than 20 years (see Table 1). Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is more common in the head and neck region. Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is  a rare tumor characterized by small round cells and hyaline cartilage that more commonly affects young adults. Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma has been associated with consistent chromosomal rearrangement.  A retrospective analysis of cases of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma identified a HEY1::NCOA2 gene fusion in 10 of 15 tested specimens.[1] This gene fusion was not associated with chromosomal changes that could be detected by karyotyping.  In one instance, translocation t(1;5)(q42;q32) was identified in a case of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma and shown to be associated with a novel IRF2BP::CDX1 gene fusion.[2] A retrospective study analyzed 13 patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, all with confirmed HEY1::NCOA2 gene fusions.[3] The median age of presentation was 19 years. Five patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcomas (39%) had an intraosseous presentation (skull, maxilla, palate, and mandible), while the remaining eight cases occurred in the brain/meninges, orbit, and nasal cavity. Microscopically, head and neck mesenchymal chondrosarcomas were characterized by primitive round cells arranged in a distinctive nested architecture and a rich staghorn vasculature. A cartilaginous component of hyaline cartilage islands and/or single chondrocytes were present in 69% of cases. A combined immunoprofile of CD99(+)/SATB2(+)/CD34(-)/STAT6(-) was typically noted. A retrospective survey of European institutions identified 113 children and adults with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. Factors associated with better outcome included the following:[4][Level of evidence C1] Lack of metastatic disease at initial presentation. Clear resection margins. Administration of postoperative chemotherapy after resection for patients with initially localized disease. A retrospective analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data from 1973 to 2011 identified 205 patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma; 82 patients had skeletal primary tumors, and 123 patients had extraskeletal tumors.[5]  The outcomes of patients with skeletal and extraskeletal primary tumors were the same.  Factors associated with outcome included the following: Primary site: The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 50% for patients with appendicular tumors, 37% for patients with  axial tumors, and 74% for patients with cranial tumors. Metastases and tumor size: Presence of metastatic disease and larger tumor size were independently associated with an increased risk of death. A single-institution retrospective review identified 43 cases of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma from 1979 to 2010.[6]  Thirty patients with localized disease were evaluated.  The mean age at diagnosis was 33 years (range, 11–65 years). The 5-year OS rate was 51%, and the 10-year OS rate was 37%. Younger age (<30 years) and male sex were associated with poorer OS and disease-free survival (DFS). Patients who did not receive adjuvant radiation therapy were more likely to have a local recurrence. Treatment options for extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma include the following: Surgery. Surgery preceded or followed by radiation therapy.[7,8] Chemotherapy followed by surgery and additional chemotherapy. Radiation therapy may also be given. A review of 15 patients younger than 26 years from the German Cooperative Soft Tissue Sarcoma Study Group (11 with soft-tissue lesions) and the German-Austrian-Swiss Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group (four with primary bone lesions) protocols suggested that complete surgical removal, or incomplete resection followed by radiation therapy, was necessary for local control.[9][Level of evidence C1] A single-institution, retrospective review identified 12 pediatric patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.[10] Eleven patients presented with localized disease, and one patient presented with pulmonary nodules.  Six patients received preoperative chemotherapy. All patients received postoperative chemotherapy (most commonly ifosfamide/doxorubicin) with or without radiation therapy (median dose, 59.4 Gy). The NCOA2 rearrangement was documented in these patients' tumors. The study confirmed that surgical resection is necessary for cure. At a median follow-up of 4.8 years, the 5-year DFS rate was 68.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.8%–96.6%), and the OS rate was 88.9% (95% CI, 66.9%–100%). A Japanese study of patients with extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma randomly assigned patients to treatment with either trabectedin or best supportive care.[11]  The median age of patients was 38 years (range, 21–77 years). The OS was higher for the patients assigned to receive trabectedin than for patients assigned to receive best supportive care. Extraskeletal osteosarcoma is extremely rare in the pediatric and adolescent population. Osseous and chondromatous neoplasms account for 0.8% of soft tissue sarcomas in patients younger than 20 years (see Table 1). A review of 32 adult patients with extraskeletal osteosarcomas consistently revealed several alterations.[12]  Frequent genomic alterations included copy number losses in CDKN2A (70%), TP53 (56%), and RB1 (49%).  Mutations were identified that affected methylation/demethylation (40%), chromatin remodeling (27%), and the WNT/SHH pathways (27%).  Cases with simultaneous TP53 and RB1 biallelic copy number losses were associated with worse DFS and OS. Extraskeletal osteosarcoma is associated with a high risk of local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis.[13] A single-institution retrospective review identified 43 patients with extraskeletal osteosarcoma; 37 patients had localized disease, and 6 patients presented with metastatic disease.  The median age was 55 years (range, 7–81 years).  Seventy-five percent of patients received chemotherapy.[14] The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 21 months. The median OS was 50 months. There was a trend toward better survival for patients who received chemotherapy, and a statistically significant improvement in survival for patients who received chemotherapy that included cisplatin. In a review of 274 patients with extraskeletal osteosarcoma, the median age at diagnosis  was 57 years (range, 12–91 years).[15][Level of evidence C1] The 5-year DFS and OS rates were significantly better for those who received chemotherapy. The use of an osteosarcoma-type regimen was associated with improved response rates. The European Musculoskeletal Oncology Society performed a retrospective analysis of 266 eligible patients with extraskeletal osteosarcoma treated between 1981 and 2014.   Fifty patients (19%) presented with metastatic disease.[15] An analysis of the 211 patients who achieved complete remission after surgical resection of the primary tumor showed a 5-year OS rate of 51% and a DFS rate of 43%. There was a favorable trend for survival among patients who were treated with chemotherapy that is usually employed for patients with osseous osteosarcoma. In a multivariable analysis, factors associated with better prognosis included younger age (<40 years), smaller tumors, and use of chemotherapy. An analysis of SEER Program data identified 256 patients  (6%) with extraskeletal osteosarcoma among 4,173 patients with high-grade osteosarcoma from 1973 to 2009.[16] Compared with skeletal osteosarcoma, patients with extraskeletal osteosarcoma were more likely to be older, female, have an axial primary tumor, and have regional lymph node involvement. Adverse prognostic features included presence of metastatic disease, larger tumor size, older age, and axial primary tumor site. Treatment options for extraskeletal osteosarcoma include the following: Surgery followed by chemotherapy.[13-15] Typical chemotherapy regimens used for osteosarcoma include some combination of cisplatin, doxorubicin, high-dose methotrexate, and ifosfamide.[13-15] For more information about  treatment of extraosseous osteosarcoma, including chemotherapy options, see Osteosarcoma and Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma of Bone Treatment.

Intermediate (rarely metastasizing).Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans not otherwise specified (NOS).Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.Epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma.Infantile fibrosarcoma. Malignant.Fibrosarcoma NOS.Myxofibrosarcoma.Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma.Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. Desmoid-type fibromatosis (previously called desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatoses). Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans not otherwise specified (NOS). Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.Epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma. Infantile fibrosarcoma. Epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma. Fibrosarcoma NOS. Myxofibrosarcoma. Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. Desmoid-type fibromatosis has previously been called desmoid tumors or aggressive fibromatoses. Desmoid-type fibromatosis has an extremely low potential to metastasize.  The tumors  are locally infiltrating, and surgical control can be difficult because of the need to preserve normal structures. Desmoid-type fibromatosis has a high potential for local recurrence.  These tumors have a highly  variable natural history, including well documented examples of spontaneous regression.[1] Most desmoid tumors are sporadic, but a small proportion may occur in association with a mutation in the APC  gene (associated with intestinal polyps and a high incidence of colon cancer). In a study of 519 patients older than 10 years with a diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis, 39 patients (7.5%, a possible underestimation) were found to have familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).[2] The patients with FAP and desmoid-type fibromatosis were younger, more often male, and had more abdominal wall or mesenteric tumors than did patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis without FAP. Mutations in exon 3 of the CTNNB1 gene are seen in more than 80% of desmoid-type fibromatosis cases. The 45F mutation in exon 3 of  the CTNNB1 gene has been associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence.[3] Repeated surgical resection can sometimes bring recurrent lesions under control.[4] Currently, there are no general recommendations for genetic testing in children with desmoid-type fibromatosis. Pathological and molecular characteristics of the tumor only provide guidance for screening. A family history of colon cancer, the presence of congenital hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium,[5,6] or location of the desmoid-type fibromatosis in the abdomen or abdominal wall [2] should prompt referral to a genetic counselor. If the tumor has a somatic CTNNB1 mutation, screening is not necessary, because the APC gene mutation has not been described in this setting. If a CTNNB1 mutation is not identified, screening for the APC mutation may be warranted.[7,8] Pediatric desmoid tumors can harbor additional mutations in the AKT, BRAF V600E, TP53, and RET genes.[9] For more information, see the Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) section in Genetics of Colorectal Cancer. Evaluating the benefit of treatment interventions for desmoid-type fibromatosis has been extremely difficult, because desmoid-type fibromatosis has a highly variable natural history, with partial regressions seen in up to 20% of patients.[10]  Large adult series and smaller pediatric series have reported long periods of disease stabilization and even regression without systemic therapy.[4,11]; [12][Level of evidence C2] For instance, in a large placebo-controlled trial of sorafenib in adult patients with desmoid tumor, the patients who received no therapy (observation/placebo) demonstrated a 20% partial regression rate, and 46% of the patients in the placebo group had no progression at 1 year.[10] Treatment options for desmoid-type fibromatosis include the following: Observation. Chemotherapy, for unresectable or recurrent tumors. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors. NOTCH pathway/gamma-secretase inhibitors. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Antiestrogen treatment. Surgery. Radiation therapy. Because of the variable natural history of desmoid tumors, as outlined above, observation is sometimes a viable option.  This is particularly the case for asymptomatic lesions, lesions that do not pose a danger to vital organs, and tumors that are incompletely resected.[4,13-19] A global consensus meeting that involved sarcoma experts with experience in both adult and pediatric desmoid tumor was organized to define the appropriate management of these tumors. The Desmoid Tumor Working Group suggested that an initial active surveillance approach does not influence the efficacy of subsequent treatments. They suggested that active therapy should only be considered in cases of persistent progression. Active surveillance includes continuous monitoring with a first magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 1 to 2 months of diagnosis, followed by scans in 3- to 6-month intervals. When the disease is located in critical structures that may pose significant morbidity, such as the mesentery and head and neck region, earlier decisions toward an active therapy should be undertaken.[20] Evidence (observation vs. initial surgery): A prospective study of 771 patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis compared initial surgery with initial observation.[21][Level of evidence C2]There was no difference in event-free survival (EFS) rates between the two groups (53% vs. 58%; P = .415). Among patients with favorable tumor locations (defined as abdominal wall, intra-abdominal, breast, digestive viscera, and lower limb), the 2-year EFS rate was similar in patients who underwent surgery (70%) or were observed (63%; P = .41). Among patients with tumors in unfavorable locations (defined as chest wall, head and neck, and upper limb), the 2-year EFS rate was significantly better for those  treated nonsurgically (52%) compared with those who underwent initial surgery (25%; P = .001). There were 173 patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis who were treated on European paediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma Study Group (EpSSG) studies since 2005. Thirteen patients (8%) had biopsies  only (no further treatment), 65 patients (42%) received chemotherapy only, 31 patients (20%) underwent surgery only, 36 patients (23%) had both chemotherapy and surgery, and 9 patients (6%) received radiation therapy in addition to other therapies.[22][Level of evidence C2]All patients were alive at the time of analysis.  The authors concluded that  the conservative nonsurgical approach did not compromise outcome in pediatric patients. There was no difference in event-free survival (EFS) rates between the two groups (53% vs. 58%; P = .415). Among patients with favorable tumor locations (defined as abdominal wall, intra-abdominal, breast, digestive viscera, and lower limb), the 2-year EFS rate was similar in patients who underwent surgery (70%) or were observed (63%; P = .41). Among patients with tumors in unfavorable locations (defined as chest wall, head and neck, and upper limb), the 2-year EFS rate was significantly better for those  treated nonsurgically (52%) compared with those who underwent initial surgery (25%; P = .001). All patients were alive at the time of analysis. The authors concluded that  the conservative nonsurgical approach did not compromise outcome in pediatric patients. The lack of intervention, surgical or otherwise, has been questioned.  The Toronto Hospital for Sick Children evaluated  the emotional impact on patients with desmoid tumors during regular return visits to a cancer center for ongoing computed tomography (CT) or MRI scans and follow-up. For individuals with desmoid tumors, higher levels of anxiety were found, even when compared with sarcoma patients, which did not ease with treatment and continued throughout surveillance.[23][Level of evidence C1] The following chemotherapy regimens have been used to treat desmoid-type fibromatosis: Methotrexate and vinblastine: This combination produced objective responses in about one-third of patients with unresectable or recurrent desmoid-type fibromatosis.[24] Doxorubicin and dacarbazine: A series of mainly adult patients with FAP and unresectable desmoid-type fibromatosis that were unresponsive to hormone therapy showed that doxorubicin plus dacarbazine followed by meloxicam (an NSAID) can be safely administered and can induce responses.[25] Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin: In a study of 11 patients, 4 patients achieved an objective response and  7 patients had stable disease.[26] In a series of five patients, a median progression-free interval  of 29 months was reported.[27] Hydroxyurea: A retrospective analysis reported the results of 16 children with previously treated desmoid tumors who were treated with hydroxyurea. Before hydroxyurea, seven patients had tumor progression, two patients had increased pain, and seven patients had both. Tumor shrinkage occurred in 37.5% of patients (with 18.7% partial remissions), and symptom improvement occurred in 68.7% of patients.[28] Targeted therapy has been used to treat children and adults with desmoid-type fibromatosis. Evidence (sorafenib): An international prospective phase III double-blind study was conducted through the National Clinical Trials Network to evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib in patients with unresectable progressive or symptomatic desmoid tumors.  Eighty-seven patients were enrolled (aged 18–72 years). Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 fashion (sorafenib: placebo); crossover to sorafenib was permitted after disease progression.[10][Level of evidence B1]The objective response rate was 33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20%–48%) in the sorafenib arm and 20% (95% CI, 8%–38%) in the placebo arm. The median time to objective response was 9.5 months for patients treated with sorafenib and 13.3 months for patients who received the placebo. The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 81% for patients treated with sorafenib, compared with 36% for patients who received the placebo. The objective response rate was 33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20%–48%) in the sorafenib arm and 20% (95% CI, 8%–38%) in the placebo arm. The median time to objective response was 9.5 months for patients treated with sorafenib and 13.3 months for patients who received the placebo. The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 81% for patients treated with sorafenib, compared with 36% for patients who received the placebo. Evidence (pazopanib): One small series included six patients (aged 3–21 years) with desmoid-type fibromatosis who were treated with pazopanib.[29] Symptomatic improvement and stable disease were reported in all patients. A randomized noncomparative study included adult patients with desmoid tumors who were treated with either pazopanib or methotrexate/vinblastine.[30]    About 84%  of the patients who received pazopanib had no progression at 6 months. Symptomatic improvement and stable disease were reported in all patients. About 84%  of the patients who received pazopanib had no progression at 6 months. The NOTCH pathway has been implicated in the development of desmoid tumors.[31] The NOTCH pathway/gamma-secretase inhibitor nirogacestat has been evaluated in adult and pediatric patients. Evidence (nirogacestat): One study included 17 adult patients with desmoid tumors, 15 of whom had mutations in the APC or CTNNB1 genes.[32][Level of evidence C3]  Five patients (29%) achieved a confirmed partial response to nirogacestat.Four adult patients experienced grade 1 irregular menstruation. In a clinical trial (NCT03785964), 75% of women of childbearing potential reported events related to ovarian dysfunction.[33] A small series included four patients younger than 20 years who received nirogacestat on a compassionate basis.[34][Level of evidence C3] Three patients had a durable benefit, defined as a complete response (n = 1), partial response (n = 1), or stable disease (n = 1). No patients experienced grades 3 or 4 adverse events. The FDA approved nirogacestat for the treatment of patients aged 18 years and older with progressive desmoid tumors who require systemic therapy. The approval was based on a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted by a consortium.[33]  In 142 patients, nirogacestat had a significant PFS benefit over placebo (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.15–0.55; P < .001). The likelihood of being event free at 2 years was 76% with nirogacestat and 44% with placebo.  Nirogacestat was associated with significant benefits related to PFS, objective response, pain, symptom burden, physical functioning, role functioning, and health-related quality of life in adults with progressing desmoid tumors.Nirogacestat was associated with a significant risk of ovarian failure. Five patients (29%) achieved a confirmed partial response to nirogacestat. Four adult patients experienced grade 1 irregular menstruation. In a clinical trial (NCT03785964), 75% of women of childbearing potential reported events related to ovarian dysfunction.[33] Three patients had a durable benefit, defined as a complete response (n = 1), partial response (n = 1), or stable disease (n = 1). No patients experienced grades 3 or 4 adverse events. In 142 patients, nirogacestat had a significant PFS benefit over placebo (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.15–0.55; P < .001). The likelihood of being event free at 2 years was 76% with nirogacestat and 44% with placebo. Nirogacestat was associated with significant benefits related to PFS, objective response, pain, symptom burden, physical functioning, role functioning, and health-related quality of life in adults with progressing desmoid tumors. Nirogacestat was associated with a significant risk of ovarian failure. NSAIDs such as sulindac have been used in single cases for desmoid-type fibromatosis; the responses seen were usually disease stabilization.[35] Antiestrogen treatment, usually tamoxifen, plus sulindac has also resulted in disease stabilization.[36] A prospective trial of the combination of tamoxifen and sulindac reported few side effects, although asymptomatic ovarian cysts were common in girls. This combination showed relatively little activity, as measured by rates of response and PFS.[37][Level of evidence B4] Surgical resection should be used judiciously in patients with desmoid tumors because spontaneous regression can occur in up to 20% of cases.  Surgical resection is recommended when tumor enlargement threatens the airway or when symptoms such as pain are persistent. A watch-and-wait strategy is otherwise preferred. If surgery is chosen, the intent is to achieve clear margins.   However, a retrospective review of children who underwent surgery for desmoid-type fibromatosis at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (SJCRH) reported no correlation between surgical margins and risk of recurrence.[19] In this study, 10 of 39 patients experienced a recurrence after surgery, with a median interval time of 2.5 years. Radiation has been used for unresectable and symptomatic desmoid-type fibromatosis or postoperatively for tumors with inadequate resections if progression would have morbid consequences.  The potential long-term complications of radiation therapy, especially subsequent neoplasms, make this modality less appealing in younger patients.[38] Postoperative radiation therapy can be considered when recurrence or progression would entail additional surgery that might cause functional or cosmetic compromise and if radiation is considered acceptable in terms of morbidities. Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)-supported clinical trials can be found on the NCI website. For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the ClinicalTrials.gov website. Dermatofibrosarcoma is a rare tumor that can be present in all age groups, but many of the reported cases arise in children.[39-41] A review of 451 cases in children younger than 20 years  in the SEER Program database found that the incidence was 1  case per 1 million. The incidence was highest among Black patients aged 15 to 19 years.  The most common sites were the trunk and extremities, which is similar to what is found in adults. Ninety-five percent of patients underwent surgery.  The overall survival (OS) rate was 100% at 5 years, 98% at 15 years, and 97% at 30 years. Male patients had decreased survival compared with female patients (P < .05).[42][Level of evidence C1] The tumor has a consistent chromosomal translocation t(17;22)(q22;q13) that  juxtaposes the COL1A1 gene with the PDGFRB gene. Guidelines for workup and management of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans have been published.[43] Treatment options for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans include the following: Surgery with or without radiation therapy. Targeted therapy (imatinib). Most patients with dermatofibrosarcoma tumors can be cured by complete surgical resection. Wide excision with negative margins or Mohs/modified-Mohs surgery will prevent most tumors from recurring.[44]  Despite the locally aggressive behavior of the tumor, lymph node or visceral metastasis rarely occurs. Evidence (surgery): The EpSSG prospective NRSTS 2005 (NCT00334854) trial identified 46 patients with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.[45] The median age at diagnosis was 6.9 years (range, 0.4–17.5 years). All patients had localized disease,  93% of patients had small tumors (<5 cm), and 76% of patients had Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) group I tumors. All patients underwent up-front surgery, and 32 patients required two procedures. There were 11 patients with IRS group II tumors, 2 of whom went on to have a local recurrence. After a median follow-up of 49 months (range, 4.2–130.9 months), all patients were alive at the time of this report. The 5-year EFS rate was 92.6% (95% CI, 78.8%–97.6%), and the OS rate was 100%. All patients underwent up-front surgery, and 32 patients required two procedures. There were 11 patients with IRS group II tumors, 2 of whom went on to have a local recurrence. After a median follow-up of 49 months (range, 4.2–130.9 months), all patients were alive at the time of this report. The 5-year EFS rate was 92.6% (95% CI, 78.8%–97.6%), and the OS rate was 100%. In retrospective reviews, postoperative radiation therapy after incomplete excision may have decreased the likelihood of recurrence.[46,47]  Metastatic disease is more likely after multiple recurrences, and radiation or other adjuvant therapy should be considered in patients with recurrences that cannot be managed surgically.[40,42] When surgical resection cannot be accomplished or the tumor is recurrent, treatment with imatinib has been  effective in adults.[48-50] Evidence (imatinib): A systematic review of nine studies examined 152 adult patients with histologically proven dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans who were treated with imatinib.[51] The study demonstrated a complete response rate of 5.2%, a partial response rate of 55.2%, and a stable disease rate of 27.6%. There were no differences in the response rates based on imatinib dosing of either 400 mg or 800 mg per day. The study demonstrated a complete response rate of 5.2%, a partial response rate of 55.2%, and a stable disease rate of 27.6%. There were no differences in the response rates based on imatinib dosing of either 400 mg or 800 mg per day. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is a rare mesenchymal tumor that is more common in children and adolescents.[52-54] Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors are rare tumors that affect soft tissues and visceral organs of children and young adults.[55] They rarely metastasize but tend to be locally invasive. Usual anatomical sites of disease include soft tissue, lungs, spleen, colon, and breast.[52] A review of 42 cases of pediatric inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor of the bladder was published in 2015.[56] Epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma is an uncommon subtype of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors that shows a male predominance and can present from infancy through adulthood.[57-59] This subtype shows epithelioid morphology and a perinuclear or nuclear membrane pattern of immunostaining for ALK.[57] The most common site of presentation is the abdomen, although other primary sites have been reported.[57-59] Roughly one-half of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors exhibit a clonal mutation that activates the ALK gene (encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase) at chromosome 2p23.[60] Most cases of epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma have RANBP2::ALK gene fusions. RRBP1::ALK gene fusions have also been reported.[57-59] Because RANBP2 localizes to the nuclear pore, this likely explains the perinuclear or nuclear membrane pattern of staining noted for ALK in epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma. ROS1 and PDGFRB kinase fusions were identified in 8 of 11 patients (73%) who were negative for ALK by immunohistochemistry.[61][Level of evidence C3] Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors recur frequently but are rarely metastatic.[52-54] Studies of children with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor  show 5-year survival rates higher than 80%.[62] Epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma is an aggressive tumor that is generally treated with surgery. Before the availability of ALK inhibitors, disease progression and high mortality rates were common.[57,58,63] Epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma generally responds to ALK inhibitors but progression on therapy has been observed, which is consistent with the aggressive clinical behavior of the tumor.[59] Treatment options for inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor include the following: Surgery and chemotherapy. Steroid therapy or NSAID therapy. Targeted therapy (ALK inhibitors). Complete surgical removal, when feasible, is the mainstay of therapy.[64] Evidence (surgery with or without chemotherapy): In a series of nine patients, the following was observed:[65][Level of evidence C1] Four patients achieved continuous remission after complete resection.Three patients with residual disease recurred but later achieved continuous remission.One patient with metastatic disease responded to multiagent chemotherapy. In another study of 31 patients who underwent complete surgical resection, 4 patients had local recurrences.[62]Of the 4 patients with local recurrences, all patients were alive after surgical re-resection (3 patients) or adjuvant chemotherapy and resection (1 patient). A review of German studies identified 37 patients younger than 21 years with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors.[66][Level of evidence C1] Of 20 patients, 17  had complete resections with no recurrences. Surgical resections can be limited to those procedures that preserve form and function.All other patients were treated with a combination of surgery and various chemotherapy regimens. The overall 5-year EFS rate was 75%, and the OS rate was 91%. A series of 32 patients aged 18 years and younger found that complete excision was the mainstay of therapy, although some patients were treated with steroids or cytotoxic chemotherapy.[67][Level of evidence C1]  The OS rate was 94%. Three patients relapsed,  two of whom died of the disease. When complete excision was performed, with or without other treatments such as steroids, there was a high survival rate for these patients. Four patients achieved continuous remission after complete resection. Three patients with residual disease recurred but later achieved continuous remission. One patient with metastatic disease responded to multiagent chemotherapy. Of the 4 patients with local recurrences, all patients were alive after surgical re-resection (3 patients) or adjuvant chemotherapy and resection (1 patient). Of 20 patients, 17  had complete resections with no recurrences. Surgical resections can be limited to those procedures that preserve form and function. All other patients were treated with a combination of surgery and various chemotherapy regimens. The overall 5-year EFS rate was 75%, and the OS rate was 91%. The OS rate was 94%. Three patients relapsed,  two of whom died of the disease. When complete excision was performed, with or without other treatments such as steroids, there was a high survival rate for these patients. The benefit of chemotherapy has been noted in case reports.[68] A prospective registry of children with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor from the European Soft Tissue Sarcoma Group (2005–2016) found an EFS rate of 82.9% and an OS rate of 98.1% at 5 years in all patients. The response rate for patients who received systemic therapy (chemotherapy or ALK inhibitor therapy) was 63% when used as front-line therapy and 66% when used as second-line therapy.  Eight of ten patients who received vinblastine and low-dose methotrexate and all five patients who received ALK inhibitors (all of whom had ALK-positive tumors) responded to treatment.[62] There are case reports of response to either steroids or NSAIDs.[62,69,70] Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors respond to ALK inhibitor therapy, as follows: Crizotinib Evidence (crizotinib): For pediatric patients with measurable disease, the use of crizotinib achieved partial tumor responses in three of six patients with ALK-translocated inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors.[71] A case report of a patient aged 16 years with metastatic/multifocal ALK-positive inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor demonstrated a complete response and a 3-year disease-free interval with crizotinib therapy.[72] One study included 14 patients with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors who were treated with crizotinib.[73][Level of evidence C3] Five patients had a complete response, seven had a partial response, and the remaining two had stable disease. No patient had relapsed at the time the article was published. Two adults with ALK-rearranged inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor achieved partial responses with crizotinib.[74][Level of evidence C3] Five patients had a complete response, seven had a partial response, and the remaining two had stable disease. No patient had relapsed at the time the article was published. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved crizotinib for patients aged 1 year and older with unresectable, recurrent, or refractory inflammatory ALK-positive myofibroblastic tumors. Ceritinib Evidence (ceritinib): Two pediatric patients enrolled in a clinical trial responded to treatment with ceritinib.[75] One patient had a complete response that was durable for multiple years on continuing therapy.The other patient had a partial response when the drug was discontinued for severe liver and renal toxicity. In a multicenter phase I study of ceritinib, 7 of 10 patients with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor had objective responses to ceritinib.[76] In a phase I trial of ceritinib for adult patients previously treated with ALK inhibitors, one patient with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor had a partial response.[77] One patient had a complete response that was durable for multiple years on continuing therapy. The other patient had a partial response when the drug was discontinued for severe liver and renal toxicity. Alectinib A case report described the successful treatment of a patient with an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and a FN1::ALK gene fusion using alectinib, a second-generation ALK inhibitor.[78] For information about the treatment of this tumor in the lungs, see Childhood Pulmonary Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumors Treatment. There are two distinct types of fibrosarcoma in children and adolescents, as follows: Infantile fibrosarcoma is a malignant fibroblastic tumor usually characterized by ETV6::NTRK3 gene fusions. Adult-type fibrosarcoma is composed of monomorphic fibroblastic tumor cells. Some of the genomic features of adult-type fibrosarcoma have been recently described.[79] These are two distinct pathological diagnoses and require different treatments. Infantile fibrosarcoma usually occurs in children younger than 1 year.  This tumor usually presents with a rapidly growing mass, often noted at birth or even seen in the prenatal ultrasound.  The tumors are frequently quite large at the time of presentation.[80] Hypercalcemia secondary to elevated levels of parathyroid hormone–related protein has been reported as a presenting feature of this disease in newborns.[81] These tumors have a low incidence of metastases at diagnosis. The tumor usually has a characteristic cytogenetic translocation t(12;15)(p13;q25) to create the ETV6::NTRK3 fusion gene.  Infantile fibrosarcoma shares this translocation and a virtually identical histological appearance with mesoblastic nephroma. Infantile fibrosarcoma occasionally occurs in children up to age 4 years.  A tumor with similar morphology has been identified in older children; in these older children, the tumors do not have the ETV6::NRTK3 fusion that is characteristic of the tumors in younger patients.[82]  BRAF intragenic deletions have been described in cases of infantile fibrosarcoma and co-occur with NTRK3 fusions.[83] One study described four young children (aged 2–10 years) with tumors that were histologically classified as infantile fibrosarcoma and had ALK rearrangements.[84] Treatment options for infantile fibrosarcoma include the following: Surgery, observation, and/or chemotherapy. Targeted therapy. Complete resection is curative in most  patients with infantile fibrosarcoma.  However, the large size of the lesion frequently makes resection without major functional consequences impossible. For instance, tumors of the extremities often require amputation for complete excision. The European pediatric group has reported that observation may also be an option in patients with group II disease after surgery.[85] Twelve patients with group II disease received no further therapy and two patients relapsed. One patient obtained a complete remission after chemotherapy. Postoperative chemotherapy was administered to patients with higher group disease and those who progressed.  In a subsequent study, only one of seven patients with group II disease progressed during observation; that patient achieved complete remission with chemotherapy.[86][Level of evidence C1] A rare case of spontaneous regression without treatment has been reported.[87][Level of evidence C3] Preoperative chemotherapy has made  a more conservative surgical
approach possible. Agents active in this setting include vincristine, dactinomycin,
cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide.[88,89]; [86,90,91][Level of evidence C1] Three older studies of patients with infantile fibrosarcoma suggested that an alkylator-free regimen was effective and  used as the first treatment choice in patients with macroscopic disease.[85,86,92] However, newer results of studies using NTRK inhibitors have suggested that kinase inhibitors are an appropriate initial therapy. Crizotinib Evidence (crizotinib): Two patients with infantile fibrosarcoma containing variant LMNA::NTRK1 gene fusions responded to crizotinib.[93,94] Larotrectinib Larotrectinib is an oral ATP-competitive inhibitor of TRK A, B, and C. Evidence (larotrectinib): A phase I/II trial of larotrectinib was completed in patients with recurrent infantile fibrosarcoma who harbored an NTRK gene fusion.[95]   Durable objective responses were seen in all eight patients, and responses occurred at a median of 1.7 months. Most toxicities were grades 1 and 2, which included transaminitis, leukopenia, neutropenia, and vomiting. There were no grade 4 or grade 5 events attributed to larotrectinib. In another study, three of five patients who achieved a partial response after neoadjuvant larotrectinib underwent a complete surgical resection with negative margins.[96,97]; [98][Level of evidence C2]  These three patients achieved an excellent pathological response (>98% treatment effect) and remained disease free 7 to 15 months after surgery. In a follow-up report, 159 patients with TRK fusion–positive tumors were enrolled in three phase I/II trials. There were  28 patients with infantile fibrosarcoma who were treated with single-agent larotrectinib.[99][Level of evidence C2]The response rate was 96%. Durable objective responses were seen in all eight patients, and responses occurred at a median of 1.7 months. Most toxicities were grades 1 and 2, which included transaminitis, leukopenia, neutropenia, and vomiting. There were no grade 4 or grade 5 events attributed to larotrectinib. These three patients achieved an excellent pathological response (>98% treatment effect) and remained disease free 7 to 15 months after surgery. The response rate was 96%. Other TRK inhibitors LOXO-195: In a clinical trial, 1 of 8 pediatric patients with an ETV6::NTRK3–rearranged infantile fibrosarcoma developed progressive disease after 8 months of larotrectinib therapy and was found to have an acquired G623R resistance mutation. The patient was treated with LOXO-195, a selective TRK inhibitor designed to overcome acquired resistance mediated by recurrent kinase domain mutations, and experienced a transient partial response.[100] Pazopanib: A patient aged 2 months with infantile fibrosarcoma was initially treated with chemotherapy.  At disease progression, a response was seen with pazopanib therapy.[101] Information about NCI-supported clinical trials can be found on the NCI website. For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the ClinicalTrials.gov website. These tumors lack the translocation seen in infantile fibrosarcomas.  They present like most nonrhabdomyosarcomas, and the management approach is similar. Myxofibrosarcoma is a rare lesion, especially in childhood. It is typically treated with complete surgical resection. Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma is a histologically deceptive soft tissue neoplasm that most commonly affects young and middle-aged adults. It is commonly located deep within the extremities.[102-104] A Children's Oncology Group (COG) trial (ARST0332 [NCT00346164]) enrolled 11 patients with this tumor type. The median age at diagnosis was 13 years and males were more commonly affected. The most common tumor sites were the lower and upper extremities (n = 9). None of the patients developed local or distant disease recurrence at a median follow up of 2.7 years.[105] Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma is characterized by a FUS::CREB3L2 gene translocation and, rarely, alternative gene translocations such as FUS::CREB3L1 and EWSR1::CREB3L1.[106,107] In a review of 33 patients (3 were younger than 18 years)  with low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, 21 patients developed a local recurrence after intervals of up to 15 years (median, 3.5 years). Fifteen patients developed metastases up to 45 years (median, 5 years) from diagnosis, most commonly to the lungs and pleura. This finding emphasizes the need for continued follow-up of these patients.[102] Even after metastases occur, the disease course may be indolent.[108] In another report, 14 of 73 patients were younger than 18 years. In this series with a relatively short follow up (median of 24 months), only 8 of 54 patients with adequate follow-up developed local (9%) or distant (6%) recurrence. This report suggested that the behavior of this tumor might be significantly better than previously reported.[109] However, because late metastases can occur, careful monitoring of these patients is warranted. Treatment options for low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma include the following: Surgery. Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma is not very chemosensitive, and the limited treatment information suggests that surgery is the treatment of choice.[108] Evidence (surgery): The German Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe (CWS) reported study results for 31 patients younger than 21 years with low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma.[103][Level of evidence C2]  The 5-year EFS rate was 71% (95% CI, ±18.6%), the 5-year local relapse-free survival rate was 76% (95% CI, ±17.6%), and the 5-year OS rate was 100%.  Among 24 patients who had R0 resections (complete resection with negative microscopic margins), 5 patients (21%) experienced relapses (3 local, 1 metastatic, and 1 combined). Among seven patients who had R1 resections (margins were microscopically positive), three patients (43%) experienced local relapses. The 5-year EFS rate was 71% (95% CI, ±18.6%), the 5-year local relapse-free survival rate was 76% (95% CI, ±17.6%), and the 5-year OS rate was 100%. Among 24 patients who had R0 resections (complete resection with negative microscopic margins), 5 patients (21%) experienced relapses (3 local, 1 metastatic, and 1 combined). Among seven patients who had R1 resections (margins were microscopically positive), three patients (43%) experienced local relapses. There are little data regarding the use of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy in this disease. One report suggests that trabectedin may be effective in the treatment of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma.[110] Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma is a rare malignant sarcoma that commonly harbors EWSR1 gene fusions and has an aggressive clinical course. The tumor responds poorly to chemotherapy.[111,112] Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma most commonly has the EWSR1::CREB3L1 gene fusion. However, EWSR1 may have other partners, including CREB3L2 and CREB3L3.[113,114] Gene fusions involving FUS (including the FUS::CREB3L2 fusion associated with low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma) and PAX5 (e.g., PAX5::CREB3L1) are uncommon but can occur.[114,115] For cases of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma that lack MUC4 expression, EWSR1 gene fusions are generally absent, while a gene fusion involving YAP1 and KMT2A is commonly observed.[111,113,116,117] Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma has more structural and chromosomal segmental alterations than low-grade fibromyxoid fibrosarcoma.[113] Treatment options for sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma include the following: Surgery. The tumor responds poorly to chemotherapy.[118] Therefore, it is typically treated with complete surgical excision. Long-term follow-up is recommended because late local recurrences and metastases can occur. Lewis JJ, Boland PJ, Leung DH, et al.: The enigma of desmoid tumors.

Ectomesenchymoma. For more information, see Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma Treatment. Ectomesenchymoma is a rare skeletal muscle tumor that mainly occurs in children. It is a biphenotypic soft tissue sarcoma with both mesenchymal and ectodermal components. A single-institution retrospective review identified seven cases of malignant ectomesenchymoma.[1]  All seven patients were male, with a mean age of 7.5 months (range, 0.6–17.0 months). Five of the seven patients in this series were healthy and free of disease at the time of reporting. A retrospective review of six patients with malignant ectomesenchymoma from a single institution identified rhabdomyosarcoma as the mesenchymal element in five of six tumors.[2]  Tumors with an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma morphology exhibited the characteristic translocation.  No unifying molecular aberrations were identified. A single-institution retrospective review identified seven cases of malignant ectomesenchymoma.[1] Most patients showed elements of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.  The mixed neuroectodermal elements were scattered ganglion cells, ganglioneuroma, or ganglioneuroblastoma.  Six of seven cases had HRAS mutations. The trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), typically lost in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, was retained in all cases. Treatment options for ectomesenchymoma include the following: Surgery. Chemotherapy. Radiation therapy. The Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe (CWS) reported on six patients (ages 0.2–13.5 years) registered over 14 years.[3][Level of evidence C1] The tumors were located in various sites including the extremities, abdomen, and orbit. All six patients were treated with surgery and chemotherapy directed at rhabdomyosarcoma. Two patients received radiation therapy. Three patients experienced tumor recurrences with rhabdomyosarcoma features. Although data are scant, it appears that the tumor may respond to chemotherapy.[3] The European paediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma Study Group (EpSSG) identified ten patients with ectomesenchymoma in a prospectively recorded database.[4] Of the ten cases, seven had an initial local diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. All patients received chemotherapy according to rhabdomyosarcoma strategy, and four patients received radiation therapy. Overall, six patients were alive in first remission, two in second remission, and one after treatment for a second primary cancer. Only the patient with a metastatic tumor at diagnosis died of their disease.

Among 43 children with HIV/AIDS who developed tumors, 8 developed Epstein-Barr virus–associated leiomyosarcoma.[1] Survivors of hereditary retinoblastoma have a statistically significant increased risk of developing leiomyosarcoma, and 78% of these patients were diagnosed 30 or more years after the initial diagnosis of retinoblastoma.[2] There are no standard treatment options for leiomyosarcoma in pediatric patients. Trabectedin has been studied in adults with leiomyosarcoma. There are no studies using trabectedin to treat leiomyosarcoma in pediatric patients. Results from studies in adults include the following: In an open-label study of trabectedin in adult patients with recurrent sarcomas, the best overall response rate (complete remission and partial remission) was seen in patients with leiomyosarcoma (7.5%).[3] The clinical benefit rate (includes stable disease) was 54% for patients with leiomyosarcoma. In another adult study, patients with recurrent liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either trabectedin or dacarbazine. Patients treated with trabectedin had a 45% reduction in disease progression.[4] Pollock BH, Jenson HB, Leach CT, et al.: Risk factors for pediatric human immunodeficiency virus-related malignancy.

The median age at presentation ranges from 8 to 14.5 years; however,  the tumor has been described in patients as young as  3 months.[1,2] The tumor commonly arises as a painless mass in the skin or subcutaneous tissue and most often involves the upper extremities, including the fingers, hand, and wrist.[3-5] Plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor is an intermediate-grade tumor that rarely metastasizes. However, there are rare  reports of the tumor spreading to regional lymph nodes or the lungs.[1,5,6] No consistent chromosomal anomalies have been detected but a t(4;15)(q21;q15) translocation has been reported.[7] Treatment options for plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor include the following: Surgery. Surgery is the treatment of choice, but local recurrence has been reported in 12% to 50% of cases.[8] Enzinger FM, Zhang RY: Plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor presenting in children and young adults.

Malignant triton tumor. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors account for 5% of soft tissue sarcomas in patients younger than 20 years (see Table 1). Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor can arise sporadically and in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).[1] Among patients with NF1, a family history of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is associated with an increased risk of developing early-onset malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.[2] A rare case of a child with documented neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and a benign neurofibroma had five recurrences. During this time, the lesions progressively lost markers (such as S-100) and acquired clear-cut signs of malignant transformation to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, documented by multiple markers, including the first example of NOTCH2 in this disease.[3] The molecular pathogenesis of adult malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors demonstrates inactivating mutations in at least three pathways, including NF1, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and PRC2 complex core components. Similar alterations have been reported in pediatric tumors.[4] Inactivating mutations of SUZ12 have been described in these tumors and are absent in neurofibromas.[5] A DNA methylation array for methylome-based and profile-based chromosomal characterization was performed on 171 peripheral nerve sheath tumors.[6]  Atypical neurofibromas and low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors were indistinguishable, with a common methylation profile and loss of CDKN2A.   Epigenomic analysis identified two groups of conventional high-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors sharing a frequent loss of neurofibromin.  The larger group showed an additional loss of trimethylation of H3K27me3.  The smaller group of patients with predominantly spinal primary sites showed retention of H3K27me3. Genomic profiling was performed on 201 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.[7] Thirteen of 201 tumors demonstrated BRAF alterations. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center studied archival and consultation material from 64 pediatric and young adult patients (aged 20 years or younger).[4] Fifty-eight percent of patients had a clinical history of NF1. All but one patient had high-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Overall, 89% of patients were classified as having high-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and 94% of patients had conventional histological features. There were 16 high-grade tumors available for molecular characterization using the MSK-IMPACT assay. These pediatric and adolescent tumors had genomic driver events that were similar to those in adult tumors. The study found genomic perturbations in PRC2 components (SUZ12 or EED; 9 cases), NF1 mutations (8 cases), and CDKN2A and CDKN2B deletions (8 cases). Loss of HDK27me3 expression was noted in 82% of conventional high-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. This finding is a potentially powerful immunohistochemical diagnostic marker for pediatric malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Factors associated with a favorable prognosis include the following:[1,8-10] Smaller tumor size. In a multivariate analysis, only tumor size and nuclear p53 expression were found to be independent predictors of disease-specific survival.[9] Male sex.[11] Non-Hispanic White race.[11] Lower stage. Lower histological grade. Extremity as the primary site. Factors associated with an unfavorable prognosis include the following:[12] High grade. Deep tumor location. Locally advanced stage at diagnosis. Presence of metastasis at diagnosis. A retrospective review of 140 patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor from the MD Anderson Cancer Center included children and adolescents. The disease-specific survival at 10 years was 32%. In this series, presence of metastatic disease was associated with a much worse prognosis.[9] Macroscopically incomplete resection (R2). Inactivation of p53, either by mutation or amplification of MDM2.[13] High expression of p53 and cyclin D1. These markers were identified as adverse prognostic factors using immunohistochemical staining of diagnostic biopsy tissue.[14][Level of evidence C2] Presence of NF1 appears to be associated with an unfavorable prognosis, but the data are mixed.[4,15] For patients with localized disease in the MD Anderson Cancer Center study, there was no significant difference in outcome between patients with and without NF1.[9] In other studies, it was not clear whether the absence of NF1 was a favorable prognostic factor as it has been associated with both favorable [8] and unfavorable outcomes.[1,8,10] In the French Sarcoma Group study, NF1 was associated with other adverse prognostic features, but was not an independent predictor of poor outcome.[12] A retrospective analysis of cancer registry data from the Netherlands identified 784 patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor; 70 of the patients were aged 18 years or younger.[16][Level of evidence C1]  In children with NF1, large tumor size was more common (>5 cm, 92.3% vs. 59.1%). Overall, the estimated 5-year survival rate was 52.4% (standard error [SE], 10.1%) for patients with localized malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and NF1, compared with 75.8% (SE, 7.1%) for  patients without NF1. The Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe (CWS) reported a retrospective review of patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor who were treated on five consecutive CWS trials.[17]  A total of 159 patients were analyzed. NF1 was reported in 38 patients (24%).  Nodal involvement was documented in 15 patients (9%) at diagnosis, and distant metastases was noted in 15 patients (9%) at diagnosis. Overall, the event-free survival (EFS) rate was 40.5% at 5 years and 36.3% at 10 years. The overall survival (OS) rate was 54.6% at 5 years and 47.1% at 10 years.  Older age, positive NF1 status, primary tumor site other than extremity, larger tumor size, higher Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) group, presence of metastatic disease, and failure to achieve first complete remission were identified as adverse prognostic factors for EFS and/or OS in the univariate analysis. Treatment options for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor include the following: Surgery preceded or followed by radiation therapy.[18,19] Chemotherapy, for unresectable tumors. Complete surgical removal of the tumor, whenever possible, is the mainstay of treatment. The role of radiation therapy is difficult to assess, but durable local control of known postoperative microscopic residual tumor is not ensured after radiation therapy. Chemotherapy has achieved objective responses in childhood malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Evidence (chemotherapy): A large retrospective analysis of the German and Italian experience with this tumor reported the following results:[1]   Sixty-five percent of measurable tumors had objective responses to ifosfamide-containing chemotherapy regimens.The analysis did not conclusively demonstrate  improved survival with chemotherapy. This retrospective analysis also noted a trend toward  improved outcome with postoperative radiation therapy. A series of 37 young patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and NF1 showed that most patients had large invasive tumors that were  poorly responsive to chemotherapy.[20] The progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 19%, and the 5-year OS rate was 28%. The European paediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma Study Group (EpSSG) performed a prospective study in patients aged 21 years and younger with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.[21]   Surgical resection of primary tumors was classified as R0 if the resection was complete with negative microscopic margins, R1 if the margins were microscopically positive, and R2 if the resection left macroscopic residual tumor. Patients were nonrandomly assigned to one of the following four treatment groups:Cohort 1: Patients with completely resected tumors (R0) who received surgery only (n = 13); the 5-year EFS rate was 92%.Cohort 2: Patients with incompletely resected tumors (R1/R2) who received adjuvant radiation therapy (n = 4); the 5-year EFS rate was 33%.Cohort 3: Patients with incompletely resected tumors (R1/R2) who received adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 7); the 5-year EFS rate was 29%.Cohort 4: Patients who received either chemotherapy before surgical resection and/or who had nodal involvement (n = 27); the 5-year EFS rate was 52%.For patients who received chemotherapy, treatment consisted of four courses of ifosfamide/doxorubicin and two courses of ifosfamide concomitant with radiation therapy (50.4–54 Gy).  The response rate to chemotherapy (partial response + complete response) in patients with measurable disease was 46%. The presence of NF1 (51% of patients) was an independent poor prognostic factor for OS and EFS. In a  study of pediatric and adult patients with either sporadic (n = 14) or chemotherapy-naïve, NF1-associated (n = 34), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, patients were treated with two cycles of ifosfamide and doxorubicin and two cycles of ifosfamide and etoposide.[22] Response rates were lower in patients with NF1-associated tumors than in patients with sporadic tumors (17.9% vs. 44.4%). However, the premature closure of the study did not allow sufficient power to detect meaningful differences in objective responses between the two groups. The rates of stable disease were similar between the two groups. Sixty-five percent of measurable tumors had objective responses to ifosfamide-containing chemotherapy regimens. The analysis did not conclusively demonstrate  improved survival with chemotherapy. This retrospective analysis also noted a trend toward  improved outcome with postoperative radiation therapy. The progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 19%, and the 5-year OS rate was 28%. Cohort 1: Patients with completely resected tumors (R0) who received surgery only (n = 13); the 5-year EFS rate was 92%. Cohort 2: Patients with incompletely resected tumors (R1/R2) who received adjuvant radiation therapy (n = 4); the 5-year EFS rate was 33%. Cohort 3: Patients with incompletely resected tumors (R1/R2) who received adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 7); the 5-year EFS rate was 29%. Cohort 4: Patients who received either chemotherapy before surgical resection and/or who had nodal involvement (n = 27); the 5-year EFS rate was 52%. For patients who received chemotherapy, treatment consisted of four courses of ifosfamide/doxorubicin and two courses of ifosfamide concomitant with radiation therapy (50.4–54 Gy). The response rate to chemotherapy (partial response + complete response) in patients with measurable disease was 46%. The presence of NF1 (51% of patients) was an independent poor prognostic factor for OS and EFS. Response rates were lower in patients with NF1-associated tumors than in patients with sporadic tumors (17.9% vs. 44.4%). However, the premature closure of the study did not allow sufficient power to detect meaningful differences in objective responses between the two groups. The rates of stable disease were similar between the two groups. Of 120 patients enrolled in Italian pediatric protocols from 1979 to 2004, an analysis identified 73 patients younger than 21 years  with relapsed malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.  Treatment options included surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.[23] The time to relapse from initial diagnosis ranged from 1 month to 204 months, with a median time to relapse of 7 months. Median OS from first relapse was 11 months, with an OS rate of 39% at 1 year and 16% at 5 years. The factors associated with a higher probability of survival after relapse were lower tumor invasiveness at initial presentation, longer time to relapse, and complete surgical resection of the tumor at relapse. A retrospective study evaluated nine patients with unresectable or metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (seven patients were previously treated) who were treated with selinexor with or without doxorubicin. Three patients experienced a partial response that lasted for 3 months to longer than 8 months, and four patients had stable disease.[24] Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)-supported clinical trials can be found on the NCI website. For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the ClinicalTrials.gov website. The following is an example of a national and/or institutional clinical trial that is currently being conducted: NCT04465643 (Neoadjuvant Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab for Newly Diagnosed Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor): The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab before standard therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy) in patients with NF1 and newly diagnosed premalignant and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors for whom surgery for resection of tumor is indicated. Malignant triton tumors are now classified as a variant of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

Infantile myofibromatosis. Infantile hemangiopericytoma, a subtype of myopericytoma, is a highly vascularized tumor of uncertain origin. For children with hemangiopericytomas, those younger than 1 year seem to have a better prognosis than  do children older than 1 year.[1-3] Histologically, hemangiopericytomas  are composed of packed round or fusiform cells that are arranged around a complex vasculature, forming many branch-like structures. Hyalinization is often present. Infantile hemangiopericytomas have similar histology but many are multilobular with vasculature outside the tumor mass.[4] Treatment options for infantile hemangiopericytomas include the following: Chemotherapy. Evidence (chemotherapy): In a series of 17 children, the differences in metastatic potential and response to treatment were clearly demonstrated for adult and infantile hemangiopericytomas.  Eleven children were older than 1 year. Several of these patients had disease in the lymph nodes or lungs.[5]  Three patients with stage I disease survived, although one patient had recurrence in the  lungs. Eight patients had stage II or stage III disease; 2 of these patients survived and 6 patients had disease progression and died. Six patients had infantile hemangiopericytoma, five of which were greater than stage I. All six patients survived, and  three patients had good responses to vincristine, actinomycin, and cyclophosphamide. Three patients with stage I disease survived, although one patient had recurrence in the  lungs. Eight patients had stage II or stage III disease; 2 of these patients survived and 6 patients had disease progression and died. Six patients had infantile hemangiopericytoma, five of which were greater than stage I. All six patients survived, and  three patients had good responses to vincristine, actinomycin, and cyclophosphamide. Several studies have reported on soft tissue sarcomas in children that were more akin to infantile myofibromatosis or hemangiopericytoma.[6,7] Rather than the ETV6::NTRK3 fusion protein seen in congenital infantile fibrosarcoma, a LMNA::NTRK1 fusion protein was identified.[8] One patient carrying this fusion responded to crizotinib. For more information about infantile myofibromatosis, see the Infantile Myofibromatosis section. Infantile myofibromatosis is a fibrous tumor of infancy and childhood that most commonly presents in the first 2 years of life.[9] The lesion can present as a single subcutaneous nodule (myofibroma) most commonly involving the head and neck region, or lesions can affect multiple skin areas, muscle, and bone (myofibromatosis).[10-13] Somatic gain-of-function PDGFRB mutations have been identified in sporadic cases of infantile myofibromatosis, including activating point mutations and in-frame indels and duplications.[14,15] PDGFRB mutations are observed in most cases with multicentric nodules, but are less common in cases with solitary myofibroma.[15,16] Some PDGFRB mutations that cause infantile myofibromatosis are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib.[15,16] An inherited autosomal dominant form of infantile myofibromatosis has been described. It is associated with germline mutations of the PDGFRB gene, with the R561C variant being most commonly observed.[17-19] The R561C variant is a relatively weak activator of PDGFRB, which may explain the presence of additional PDGFRB mutations with stronger activity in some familial infantile myofibromatosis cases.[16,17] The European Society for Paediatric Oncology Host Genome Working Group developed counseling and germline testing guidelines for these groups of  children. This group recommends germline analysis for children with infantile myofibromatosis who have at least one of the following criteria:[20] Multicentric disease. First- or second-degree relatives with infantile myofibromatosis or soft tissue nodules during childhood. A known PDGFRB germline variant in the family. Suspected germline mosaic PDGFRB variants. Patients with these tumors usually have an excellent prognosis and the tumors can regress spontaneously. However, about one-third of cases with multicentric involvement will also have visceral involvement, and the prognosis for these patients is poor.[12,13,21] Treatment options for infantile myofibromatosis include the following: Observation. Chemotherapy. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors effective against PDGFRB. Ninety-five patients were prospectively enrolled in five Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe (CWS) trials and one registry trial between 1981 and 2016.[22] Localized disease was diagnosed in 71 patients. Forty-two (59%) of these patients were infants younger than 12 months. The mainstay of treatment (applied to 55 children) was watch and wait after initial biopsy or resection. Systemic therapy was only recommended in cases of life-threatening progressive disease or in cases of compression of vital structures or organ dysfunction in the setting of progressive disease. Based on these criteria, chemotherapy was administered to 16 of 71 patients as an individual decision at the treating center: 8  patients received methotrexate/vinblastine, 5 patients received vincristine/dactinomycin/cyclophosphamide (VAC), and 3 patients received other therapies. Of the patients who received chemotherapy, nine could be assessed for response. Two patients experienced a complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) (objective response rate, 22%). Overall, 77 patients were alive in CR, and 10 patients were in PR. Three patients died of progressive disease. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 73% for patients with localized disease and 51% for patients with multifocal disease. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 95% for patients with localized or multifocal disease. The use of combination chemotherapy with vincristine/dactinomycin and vinblastine/methotrexate have proven effective in cases of multicentric disease with visceral involvement and in cases in which the disease has progressed and has threatened the life of the patient (e.g., upper airway obstruction).[12,13,23] Case reports have described prompt tumor regression in patients with infantile myofibromatosis that have PDGFRB mutations when treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib and sunitinib, which inhibit the gain-of-function mutated PDGFRB in the tumor.[24-27] Rodriguez-Galindo C, Ramsey K, Jenkins JJ, et al.: Hemangiopericytoma in children and infants.

Desmoplastic small round cell tumor. Rhabdoid tumor NOS (extrarenal). Perivascular epithelioid tumor (PEComa), malignant. Undifferentiated sarcoma. Pleomorphic sarcoma, undifferentiated. Round cell sarcoma, undifferentiated. Carney complex is an autosomal dominant syndrome caused by mutations in the PRKAR1A gene, located on chromosome 17.[1] The syndrome is characterized by 
cardiac and cutaneous myxomas, pale brown to brown lentigines, blue nevi, primary pigmented nodular
adrenocortical disease causing Cushing syndrome, and a variety of endocrine and nonendocrine tumors, including pituitary adenomas, thyroid tumors, and large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumor of the testis.[1-3] There are published surveillance guidelines for patients with Carney complex that include cardiac, testicular, and thyroid ultrasonography. For patients with the Carney complex, prognosis
depends on the frequency of recurrences of cardiac and skin myxomas and other
tumors. For more information about the treatment of conditions related to Carney complex, see the following summaries: Childhood Cardiac Tumors Treatment. Childhood Testicular Cancer Treatment. Childhood Thyroid Cancer Treatment. Synovial sarcoma accounts for 9% of soft tissue sarcomas in patients younger than 20 years (see Table 1). Synovial sarcoma is one of the most common nonrhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcoma (NRSTS) in children and adolescents. In a review of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database from 1973 to 2005, 1,268 patients with synovial sarcoma were identified. Approximately 17% of these patients were children and adolescents, and the median age at diagnosis was 34 years.[4] In addition, in the Children's Oncology Group (COG) ARST0332 (NCT00346164) and European paediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma Study Group (EpSSG) 2005 protocols, synovial sarcoma was the single most common histological subtype.[5] The most common primary tumor location is the extremities, followed by trunk and head and neck.[4] Rarely, a synovial sarcoma may arise in the heart or pericardium or appear with a pleuropulmonary presentation.[6-9] The most common site of metastasis is the lung.[10,11] The risk of metastases is highly influenced by tumor size. Patients with tumors that are larger than 5 cm have an estimated 32-fold higher risk of developing metastases compared with other patients. The Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe (CWS) reported on 432 patients younger than 21 years diagnosed with synovial sarcoma  between 1981 and 2018.[12] The study compared three age groups of patients: children (aged 0–12 years; n = 176), adolescents (aged 13–16 years; n = 178), and young adults (aged 17–21 years; n = 78). The proportion of invasive tumors  was significantly higher in older patients (children, 33%; adolescents, 39%; and young adults, 54%; P = .009). The proportion of tumors larger than 10 cm (children, 13%; adolescents, 21%; and young adults, 31%; P = .006)  and the presence of metastasis at first diagnosis were also higher in older patients (children, 6%; adolescents, 10%; and young adults, 21%; P = .001). Synovial sarcoma can be subclassified as
the following types: Synovial sarcoma, spindle cell. Synovial sarcoma, biphasic. Synovial sarcoma, poorly differentiated. The diagnosis of synovial sarcoma is made by immunohistochemical analysis,
ultrastructural findings, and demonstration of the specific chromosomal
translocation t(x;18)(p11.2;q11.2).  This abnormality is specific for synovial
sarcoma and is found in all morphological subtypes.  Synovial sarcoma results in rearrangement
of the SS18 gene on chromosome 18 with one of the subtypes (1, 2, or 4) of the
SSX gene on chromosome X.[13,14]  It is thought that the SS18::SSX fusion transcript promotes epigenetic silencing of key tumor suppressor genes.[15] In one report, reduced SMARCB1 nuclear reactivity on immunohistochemical staining was seen in 49 cases of synovial sarcoma, suggesting that this pattern may help distinguish synovial sarcoma from other histologies.[16] Favorable prognostic factors Patients younger than 10 years have  more favorable outcomes and clinical features than do older patients. Favorable clinical features include the following:[4,17-19] Extremity primary tumors. Smaller tumors. Localized disease. Response to chemotherapy was correlated with improved survival in one meta-analysis. Unfavorable prognostic factors The following studies have reported multiple factors associated with unfavorable outcomes: In a  retrospective analysis of synovial sarcoma in children and adolescents who were treated in Germany and Italy, tumor size (>5 cm or ≤5 cm in greatest dimension) was an important predictor of event-free survival (EFS).[20] In this analysis, local invasiveness conferred an inferior probability of EFS, but surgical margins were not associated with clinical outcome. In a single-institution retrospective analysis of 111 patients with synovial sarcoma who were younger than 22 years at diagnosis, larger tumor size, greater depth in tissue, greater local invasiveness, and more proximal tumor location were associated with poorer overall survival (OS).[21][Level of evidence C1] A multicenter analysis of 219 children from various treating centers, including Germany, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH), Instituto Tumori, and MD Anderson Cancer Center, reported an estimated 5-year OS rate of 80% and an EFS rate of  72%.[19] In this analysis, an interaction between tumor size and invasiveness was observed. In multivariate analysis, patients with large or invasive tumors or with Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) group III disease (localized, incompletely resected or with biopsy only) and group IV  disease (metastases at diagnosis) had decreased OS. Treatment with radiation therapy was related to improved OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2–0.7). In IRS group III patients, objective response to chemotherapy (18 of 30 [60%]) correlated with improved survival. Expression and genomic index prognostic signatures have been studied in synovial sarcoma.  Complex genomic profiles, with greater rearrangement of the genome, are more common in adults than in younger patients with synovial sarcoma and are associated with a higher risk of metastasis.[22] A review of 84 patients with localized synovial sarcoma who had information on fusion status (SS18::SSX) and histological grading found no difference in OS according to these criteria.  However, for tumor size at diagnosis, the study showed that patients with tumors between 5 cm and 10 cm had a worse prognosis than those with smaller tumors (P = .02). Patients with tumors larger than 10 cm had an even worse OS (P = .0003).[23][Level of evidence C1] The German CWS group reviewed 27 evaluable patients younger than 21 years with pulmonary metastases among 296 patients with synovial sarcoma.  All patients had metastasis to the lungs. The 5-year EFS rate was 26%, and the OS rate was 30%. The most important prognostic factor at presentation was that the metastases were limited to one lesion in one lung or one lesion in both lungs (a group they termed oligometastatic). Treatment elements associated with superior survival were adequate local therapy of the primary tumor and, if feasible, for the metastases. The use of whole-lung irradiation did not correlate with better outcomes.[24][Level of evidence C1] The EpSSG designed a genomic index  for synovial sarcoma.[25][Level of evidence C2]  Genomic index was defined as A2/C, where A is the total number of alterations (segmental gains and losses) and C is the number of involved chromosomes on array comparative genomic hybridization results.  In a multivariate analysis of 61 pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients (aged <25 years), high genomic index was an independent predictor of decreased EFS and OS. In adults, factors such as International Union Against Cancer/American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III and stage IVA, poor tumor necrosis, truncal location,  elevated mitotic rate, older age, and higher histological grade have been associated with a worse prognosis.[26-28] Treatment options for synovial sarcoma include the following: Surgery alone. Surgery and chemotherapy, with or without radiation therapy.[29,30] Evidence (surgery alone): The COG and the EpSSG reported a combined analysis of 60 patients younger than 21 years with localized synovial sarcoma prospectively assigned to surgery without adjuvant radiation therapy or chemotherapy.[31]  Enrollment was limited to patients with initial complete resection with histologically free margins, with a grade 2 tumor of any size or a grade 3 tumor 5 cm or smaller.  The 3-year EFS rate was 90% (median follow-up, 5.2 years; range, 1.9–9.1). All eight events were local tumor recurrence; no metastatic recurrences were seen. All patients with recurrent disease were effectively treated with second-line therapy, resulting in an OS rate of 100%. Therefore, the authors concluded that a surgery-only approach was optimal for patients who achieved an R0 resection (complete resection with negative microscopic margins) and had tumors smaller than 5 cm, regardless of grade. The 3-year EFS rate was 90% (median follow-up, 5.2 years; range, 1.9–9.1). All eight events were local tumor recurrence; no metastatic recurrences were seen. All patients with recurrent disease were effectively treated with second-line therapy, resulting in an OS rate of 100%. Therefore, the authors concluded that a surgery-only approach was optimal for patients who achieved an R0 resection (complete resection with negative microscopic margins) and had tumors smaller than 5 cm, regardless of grade. Synovial sarcoma appears to be more sensitive to chemotherapy than many other soft tissue sarcomas. Children with synovial sarcoma seem to have a better prognosis than do adults with synovial sarcoma.[11,28,32-37] The most commonly used chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of synovial sarcoma incorporate ifosfamide and doxorubicin.[19,35,38] Response rates to the ifosfamide and doxorubicin regimen are higher than in other NRSTS.[39] Evidence (surgery and chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy): Several treatment centers advocate chemotherapy after resection and radiation therapy for children and young adults with synovial sarcoma.[19,20,40-42] The International Society of Pediatric Oncology-Malignant Mesenchymal Tumors studies showed that select patients (young age, <5 cm resected tumors) with nonmetastatic synovial sarcoma treated with chemotherapy can have excellent outcomes in the absence of radiation therapy. However, it is still unclear whether that approach obviates an advantage of radiation for local or regional control.[41] A German trial suggested a benefit for postoperative chemotherapy in children with synovial sarcoma.[42] A meta-analysis also suggested that chemotherapy may provide benefit.[19] The COG reported an analysis of the subset of patients with synovial sarcoma treated on the ARST0332 (NCT00346164) trial. This was a prospective treatment assignment trial for patients younger than 30 years with NRSTS.[43] They analyzed the outcomes of 138 eligible patients.Overall, R0 resection or R1 resection (microscopically positive margins) of the primary tumor was achieved in 129 patients (93.5%): 69 patients (53.5%) at study entry and 60 patients (46.5%) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Of these, 104 patients (80.6%) had an R0 resection: 55 patients (53%) at study entry and 49 patients (47%) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In the 60 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, response was evaluable in 55 patients. Two patients (3.6%) had a complete response, 9 (16.4%) had a partial response, 41 (74.6%) had stable disease, and 3 (5.5%) had progressive disease. The tissue from 57 tumors was centrally reviewed after definitive resection. Forty-one tumors (72%) had less than 90% necrosis, and 16 tumors (28%) had 90% necrosis or more.For the 46 patients in the low-risk group, the 5-year EFS rate was 81.9% (95% CI, 69%–94.8%), and the OS rate was 97.7% (95% CI, 92.7%–100%).For the 23 patients in the intermediate-risk group (treatment arm C), the 5-year EFS rate was 64% (95% CI, 42.4%–85.8%), and the OS rate was 89.5% (95% CI, 75.3%–100%).For the 49 patients in the intermediate-risk group  (treatment arm D), the 5-year EFS rate was 71.2% (95% CI, 56.5%–85.9%), and the OS rate was 86.5% (95% CI, 75.6%–97.3%).For the 21 patients in the high-risk group, the 5-year EFS rate was 7.6% (95% CI, 0%–22%), and the OS rate was 12.5% (95% CI, 0%–28.7%). The EpSSG performed a prospective study of patients younger than 21 years with synovial sarcoma (CCLG-EPSSG-NRSTS-2005 [NCT00334854]).[44][Level of evidence C1] Patients were stratified into the following three risk groups and nonrandomly assigned to treatment by risk group:Low-risk patients had IRS group I tumors less than 5 cm in size and nonaxial primary tumors.Intermediate-risk patients had no axial primary tumors and IRS group I tumors greater than 5 cm or IRS group II tumors.High-risk patients included all patients with axial primary sites (head and neck, lung and pleura, trunk, retroperitoneal),  IRS group III tumors, or N1 tumors.Outcomes for patients treated on the CCLG-EPSSG-NRSTS-2005 trial are described in Table 10.Table 10.

Eligibility was restricted to patients with localized tumors with macroscopic residual disease after first surgery, before the initiation of systemic therapy (IRS III) and no clinically detectable metastatic disease. There were 145 patients in the study with a median age of 14.5 years (range, 0.2–33.2 years). The protocols recommended but did not require radiation therapy to be given before definitive tumor resection. Radiation therapy was administered to 115 patients (79%), and 23 patients did not receive radiation therapy (no information documented for 7 patients). Of the 115 irradiated patients, 57  were irradiated before tumor excision and 52 after tumor excision.[45] In this nonrandomized comparison, the sequencing of radiation therapy before definitive resection was associated with a statistically significant improvement in local recurrence-free survival rates, compared with definitive surgery before radiation therapy. Omission of radiation therapy was associated with an inferior outcome.Outcomes for patients are described in Table 11.Table 11.

Low-risk patients had IRS group I tumors less than 5 cm in size and nonaxial primary tumors. Intermediate-risk patients had no axial primary tumors and IRS group I tumors greater than 5 cm or IRS group II tumors. High-risk patients included all patients with axial primary sites (head and neck, lung and pleura, trunk, retroperitoneal),  IRS group III tumors, or N1 tumors. Outcomes for patients treated on the CCLG-EPSSG-NRSTS-2005 trial are described in Table 10. In this nonrandomized comparison, the sequencing of radiation therapy before definitive resection was associated with a statistically significant improvement in local recurrence-free survival rates, compared with definitive surgery before radiation therapy. Omission of radiation therapy was associated with an inferior outcome. Outcomes for patients are described in Table 11. For patients with recurrent synovial sarcoma, the survival rate after relapse is poor (30%–40% at 5 years). Factors associated with outcome after relapse include duration of first remission (> or ≤ 18 months) and lack of a second remission.[46,47] In a German experience, surgical resection of metastatic disease was the most common way to achieve a second complete remission.[47]  Maintenance chemotherapy with oral trofosfamide, idarubicin, and etoposide  or  oral cyclophosphamide and intravenous vinblastine was administered on an individual basis. Radiation therapy (stereotactic body radiation therapy) can be used to target select pulmonary metastases. This is usually considered after a minimum of one resection to confirm metastatic disease.  Radiation therapy is particularly appropriate for patients with lesions that threaten air exchange because of their location adjacent to bronchi or cause pain by invading the chest wall.[48] Between 70% to 80% of synovial sarcomas express NY-ESO-1, an immunogenic cancer testis antigen.[49]   NY-ESO-1 can be targeted with adoptive transfer of T cells engineered to express NY-ESO-1c259, an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) targeting NY-ESO-1/LAGE1a.[50]  The procedure to produce the genetically engineered T cells restricts their reactivity to a single HLA type. All clinical trials of this technology chose HLA-A*02 as the initial target and limited eligibility to patients whose tumors expressed NY-ESO-1 and who had HLA-A*02.  In a multi-institutional trial, confirmed antitumor responses occurred in 50% of patients (6 of 12) and were characterized by tumor shrinkage over several months. Circulating NY-ESO-1c259T cells were present postinfusion in all patients, and the cells persisted for at least 6 months in all responders.[51] Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)-supported clinical trials can be found on the NCI website. For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the ClinicalTrials.gov website. Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare mesenchymal tumor of uncertain histogenesis that displays multilineage differentiation.[52] Epithelioid sarcoma commonly presents as a slowly growing firm nodule based in the deep soft tissue. The proximal type predominantly affects adults and involves the axial skeleton and proximal sites. The tumor is highly aggressive and has a propensity for lymph node metastases. Epithelioid sarcoma is characterized by inactivation of the SMARCB1 gene, which is present in both conventional and proximal types of epithelioid sarcoma.[53] This abnormality leads to increased dependence on EZH2 and tumor formation.[54] Treatment options for epithelioid sarcoma include the following: Surgery with or without chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Targeted therapy. Surgical removal of primary and recurrent tumor(s) is the most effective treatment.[55][Level of evidence C1] Because of the propensity of this disease to have occult metastasis to the lymph nodes, sentinel lymph node biopsy is recommended for epithelioid sarcoma of the extremities or buttocks in the absence of clinically (by imaging or physical examination) enlarged lymph nodes.[56] Evidence (surgery with or without chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy): In a German CWS retrospective analysis of 67 children, adolescents, and young adults (median age, 14 years) with epithelioid sarcoma, 53 patients presented with localized disease and 14 patients presented  with metastatic disease.[57][Level of evidence C1] Fifty-eight of 67 patients were treated with primary resections. Resections were microscopically complete in 35 patients, microscopically incomplete in  12 patients, and macroscopically incomplete in 20 patients.  Forty-nine patients received chemotherapy,  and 33 patients received radiation therapy. Complete remission was achieved in 45 of 53 patients (85%) with localized disease. Twenty-seven patients relapsed after a median time of 0.9 years (range, 0.1–2.3 years). Patients with localized disease had a 5-year EFS rate of 35% (95% CI, ±12%) and an OS rate of 48% (95% CI, ±14%). Patients with metastatic disease had a 5-year EFS rate of 7% (95% CI, ±14%) and an OS rate of 9% (95% CI, ±16%). Smaller tumor size, lower IRS group, less tumor invasiveness, negative nodal status, and microscopically complete resection correlated with a favorable prognosis in patients with localized disease. A retrospective analysis reviewed COG and EpSSG prospective clinical trials that enrolled patients younger than 30 years with epithelioid sarcoma.[58][Level of evidence B4]  The analysis identified 63 patients who were treated between July 2005 and November 2015.  Patients were stratified into three risk groups using a combination of clinical features and treatment received.  Low-risk patients (n = 34) underwent surgery with or without radiation therapy and included predominantly patients with nonmetastatic widely or marginally resected  tumors 5 cm or smaller. The intermediate-risk group included patients (n = 16) with nonmetastatic, high-grade, and larger than 5 cm tumors or unresectable tumors. Patients with nodal or distant metastatic disease were at high risk (n = 13) , regardless of tumor grade or size.  Partial response was observed in 11 of 22 patients (50%) who received neoadjuvant therapy. Events were local recurrence (n = 10) and distant recurrence (n = 15). The estimated 5-year OS rates were 86.4% for low-risk patients, 63.5% for intermediate-risk patients, and 0% for high-risk patients. Locoregional nodal involvement, invasive tumor, high grade, and lesser extent of resection predicted poorer EFS in patients without metastases. A review of 30 pediatric patients with epithelioid sarcoma (median age at presentation, 12 years) reported the following results:[59]Responses to chemotherapy were reported in 40% of patients using sarcoma-based treatment regimens. Sixty percent of patients were alive at 5 years after initial diagnosis. A single-institution retrospective review of 20 patients,  which included children and adults (median age, 27.3 years), reported the following:[55]There was no difference in the probability of recurrence between patients who received chemotherapy and those who did not receive chemotherapy. The authors suggested that radiation therapy may be useful. Complete remission was achieved in 45 of 53 patients (85%) with localized disease. Twenty-seven patients relapsed after a median time of 0.9 years (range, 0.1–2.3 years). Patients with localized disease had a 5-year EFS rate of 35% (95% CI, ±12%) and an OS rate of 48% (95% CI, ±14%). Patients with metastatic disease had a 5-year EFS rate of 7% (95% CI, ±14%) and an OS rate of 9% (95% CI, ±16%). Smaller tumor size, lower IRS group, less tumor invasiveness, negative nodal status, and microscopically complete resection correlated with a favorable prognosis in patients with localized disease. Partial response was observed in 11 of 22 patients (50%) who received neoadjuvant therapy. Events were local recurrence (n = 10) and distant recurrence (n = 15). The estimated 5-year OS rates were 86.4% for low-risk patients, 63.5% for intermediate-risk patients, and 0% for high-risk patients. Locoregional nodal involvement, invasive tumor, high grade, and lesser extent of resection predicted poorer EFS in patients without metastases. Responses to chemotherapy were reported in 40% of patients using sarcoma-based treatment regimens. Sixty percent of patients were alive at 5 years after initial diagnosis. There was no difference in the probability of recurrence between patients who received chemotherapy and those who did not receive chemotherapy. The authors suggested that radiation therapy may be useful. Evidence (tazemetostat): In a  phase II trial of 62 adult patients with epithelioid sarcoma and documented loss of INI1 by immunohistochemistry or biallelic SMARCB1 (the gene that encodes INI1) alterations, tazemetostat showed clinical activity.[60]    There were 9 of 62 confirmed partial responses, with an objective response rate of 15% and a disease control rate of 26%. There were 9 of 62 confirmed partial responses, with an objective response rate of 15% and a disease control rate of 26%. In January 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for tazemetostat for adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with  metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma who were not eligible for complete resection. Information about NCI-supported clinical trials can be found on the NCI website. For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the ClinicalTrials.gov website. The following is an example of a national and/or institutional clinical trial that is currently being conducted: PEPN2121 (NCT05286801) (Tiragolumab and Atezolizumab for the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory SMARCB1- or SMARCA4-Deficient Tumors): This study is evaluating the combination of a PD-L1 targeting antibody (atezolizumab) with a TIGIT targeting antibody (tiragolumab) for patients with SMARCB1- or SMARCA4-deficient tumors. Patients with epithelioid sarcoma may be eligible for this study. Alveolar soft part sarcomas account for 1.4% of soft tissue sarcomas in patients younger than 20 years (see Table 1). The median age at presentation is 25 years for patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma. This tumor most commonly arises in the extremities but can occur in the oral and maxillofacial region.[61-63] Alveolar soft part sarcoma in children can present with evidence of metastatic disease.[64] Delayed metastases to the brain and lung are uncommon.[61] In a series of 61 patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma who were treated in four consecutive CWS trials and the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Registry (SoTiSaR), 46 patients presented with localized disease and 15 patients had evidence of metastasis at diagnosis.[65] Sixty-nine patients younger than 30 years with alveolar soft part sarcoma  were treated between 1980 and 2014 at four major institutions. The median age at diagnosis was 17 years, and 64% of patients were female. The most common site of disease was the lower extremity, and 26 patients had an ASPSCR1::TFE3 gene translocation.[66] This tumor of uncertain histogenesis is characterized by a consistent chromosomal translocation t(X;17)(p11.2;q25) that fuses the ASPSCR1 gene with the TFE3 gene.[67,68] In patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma, presentation with metastases is common and often has a prolonged indolent course. Alveolar soft part sarcoma in children may have an indolent course.[64] Patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma may relapse several years after a prolonged period of apparent remission.[65,69] In a series of 19 treated patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma, one study reported a 5-year OS rate of 80%. The OS rate was 91% for patients with localized disease, 100% for patients with tumors 5 cm or smaller, and 31% for patients with tumors larger  than 5 cm.[70] In another series of 33 patients, the OS rate was 68% at 5 years from diagnosis and 53% at 10 years from diagnosis. Survival was better for patients with smaller tumors (≤5 cm) and completely resected tumors.[71][Level of evidence C1] A retrospective review of children and young adults younger than 30 years (median age, 17 years; range, 1.5–30 years) from four institutions identified 69 patients treated primarily with surgery between 1980 and 2014.[66][Level of evidence C1]  The ASPSCR1::TFE3 translocation was present in all 26 patients tested. There were 19 patients with IRS group I tumors (28%), 7 patients  with IRS group II  tumors (10%), 5  patients with IRS group III tumors (7%), and 38 patients with IRS group IV tumors (55%).  The 5-year EFS rate was 80%, and the OS rate was 87% for the 31 patients with localized tumors (IRS postsurgical groups I, II, and III). The 5-year EFS rate was 7%, and the OS rate was 61% for the 38 patients with metastatic tumors (IRS group IV). In a series of patients treated on consecutive studies from Germany, 15 of 61 patients (25%) presented with metastases, often miliary in nature. Despite lack of response to chemotherapy, the 5-year OS rate was 61%, with an EFS rate of 20%.[65] Treatment options for alveolar soft part sarcoma include the following: Surgery with or without radiation therapy and chemotherapy.[29,30] Targeted therapy (tyrosine kinase inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors).[72] The standard treatment approach is complete resection of the primary lesion.[70]
If complete excision is not feasible, radiation therapy is
administered. Evidence (surgery with or without chemotherapy): A study from China reported on 18 patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma of the oral and maxillofacial region. Fifteen patients were younger than 30 years. Surgical removal with negative margins was the primary treatment.[63][Level of evidence C2]  All patients survived, and only one patient had metastatic disease recurrence. In a series of patients treated on consecutive studies from Germany, the following was reported:[65]Progression-free survival (PFS) for patients without metastases on presentation appeared to improve with complete resection of the primary tumor. The 5-year EFS rate was 100% for patients with completely resected tumors, compared with 50% for patients with microscopic or gross residual disease. In a  series of 51 pediatric patients aged 0 to 21 years with  alveolar soft part sarcoma, the following was reported:[61][Level of evidence C1]   The OS rate was 78% at 10 years, and the EFS rate was about 63%.  Patients with localized disease (n = 37) had a 10-year OS rate of 87%. The 14 patients with metastases at diagnosis had a 10-year OS rate of 44%, partly resulting from the surgical removal of the primary tumor and lung metastases in some patients.  Only 3 of 18 patients (17%) with measurable disease had a response to conventional antisarcoma chemotherapy, but two of four patients treated with sunitinib had a partial response. All patients survived, and only one patient had metastatic disease recurrence. Progression-free survival (PFS) for patients without metastases on presentation appeared to improve with complete resection of the primary tumor. The 5-year EFS rate was 100% for patients with completely resected tumors, compared with 50% for patients with microscopic or gross residual disease. The OS rate was 78% at 10 years, and the EFS rate was about 63%. Patients with localized disease (n = 37) had a 10-year OS rate of 87%. The 14 patients with metastases at diagnosis had a 10-year OS rate of 44%, partly resulting from the surgical removal of the primary tumor and lung metastases in some patients. Only 3 of 18 patients (17%) with measurable disease had a response to conventional antisarcoma chemotherapy, but two of four patients treated with sunitinib had a partial response. Studies of targeted therapy (tyrosine kinase inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors) have been done. Sunitinib Evidence (sunitinib): A small retrospective study of nine adult patients with metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma treated with sunitinib reported partial responses in five patients and stable disease in two patients.[73][Level of evidence C3] In another study, 15 adult patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma were treated with sunitinib. Five patients were treated with sunitinib for longer than 2 years.[74][Level of evidence C1]Six patients experienced partial responses. The median PFS was 19 months, and the median OS was 56 months. The 5-year OS rate was 49%. Six patients experienced partial responses. The median PFS was 19 months, and the median OS was 56 months. The 5-year OS rate was 49%. Cediranib Cediranib is an inhibitor of all three known vascular epidermal growth factor receptors. Evidence (cediranib): In a pediatric phase II trial of cediranib, using 70% of the adult maximum tolerated dose in patients younger than 16 years, the following was reported:[75][Level of evidence B4]Five of seven patients had stable disease for 14 months or longer. An international group performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase II trial of cediranib in adolescent and adult patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma.[76][Level of evidence A1]  Median percentage change in sum of target marker lesion diameters for the evaluable population was -8.3% (interquartile range [IQR], -26.5 to 5.9) for patients who received cediranib therapy, compared with 13.4% (IQR, 1.1–21.3) for patients who received the placebo (one-sided P = .0010).  The authors concluded that cediranib is an active agent in patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma. In a phase II trial of cediranib, 15 of 43 adult patients (35%) with metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma had partial responses.[77][Level of evidence C3] Five of seven patients had stable disease for 14 months or longer. Median percentage change in sum of target marker lesion diameters for the evaluable population was -8.3% (interquartile range [IQR], -26.5 to 5.9) for patients who received cediranib therapy, compared with 13.4% (IQR, 1.1–21.3) for patients who received the placebo (one-sided P = .0010). The authors concluded that cediranib is an active agent in patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma. Pazopanib Evidence (pazopanib): In an open-label trial that evaluated the efficacy of pazopanib in six adult patients, one patient achieved a partial response and five patients had stable disease.[78] Another trial included 30 adult patients who were treated with pazopanib.[79]One patient experienced a complete response, seven patients experienced partial responses, and 17 patients had stable disease. The median PFS was 13.6 months. One patient experienced a complete response, seven patients experienced partial responses, and 17 patients had stable disease. The median PFS was 13.6 months. Axitinib and pembrolizumab Axitinib is a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Pembrolizumab is an anti–programmed cell death protein 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. Evidence (axitinib and pembrolizumab): In one trial, adult patients with advanced sarcomas were treated with a combination of axitinib and pembrolizumab.[72]  For  the 12 patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma, the 3-month PFS rate was 73%. Six of eleven patients with evaluable disease had partial responses to axitinib. For  the 12 patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma, the 3-month PFS rate was 73%. Six of eleven patients with evaluable disease had partial responses to axitinib. There have been sporadic reports of objective responses to treatment with interferon-alpha and bevacizumab.[61,80,81] Because these tumors are rare, all children with alveolar soft part sarcoma should be considered for enrollment in prospective clinical trials. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Information about NCI-supported clinical trials can be found on the NCI website. For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the ClinicalTrials.gov website. The following is an example of a national and/or institutional clinical trial that is currently being conducted: NCT03141684 (Atezolizumab in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed and Metastatic Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery): This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab works in treating patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma that has not been treated, has spread from where it started to other places in the body, and cannot be removed by surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Patients aged 2 years and older are eligible for this trial. Clear cell sarcoma (formerly called malignant melanoma of soft parts)  is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that typically involves the deep soft tissues of the extremities. It is also called clear cell sarcoma of tendons and aponeuroses. The tumor often affects adolescents and young adults. The tumor most commonly affects the lower extremity, particularly  the foot, heel, and ankle.[82,83] It has a  high propensity for nodal dissemination, especially metastases to regional lymph nodes (12%–43%).[83,84] The tumor typically has an indolent clinical course. Patients   who have small, localized tumors  with low mitotic rate and intermediate histological grade  have the best outcomes.[85] Clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue is characterized by EWSR1::ATF1 or EWSR1::CREB1 gene fusions.[86,87] Treatment options for clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue include the following: Surgery with or without radiation therapy.[29,30] Targeted therapy. Surgery with or without radiation therapy is the treatment of choice and offers the best chance for cure. Evidence (surgery with or without radiation therapy): In a series of 28 pediatric patients reported by the Italian and German Soft Tissue Cooperative Studies, the median age at diagnosis was 14 years and the lower extremity was the most common primary site (50%).[88]; [89][Level of evidence C2] In this series, 12 of 13 patients with completely resected tumors were cured. For patients with more advanced disease, the outcome is poor and chemotherapy is rarely effective. In this series, 12 of 13 patients with completely resected tumors were cured. For patients with more advanced disease, the outcome is poor and chemotherapy is rarely effective. Evidence (targeted therapy): In a study by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, 26 patients with clear cell sarcoma who had metastatic disease and documented EWSR1 rearrangements were treated with crizotinib.[90] One patient achieved a partial response, and 17 patients had stable disease. One patient achieved a partial response, and 17 patients had stable disease. Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma is relatively rare among soft tissue sarcomas, representing only 2.3% of all soft tissue sarcomas.[91] It has been reported in children and adolescents.[92] The tumor has traditionally been considered to have low-grade malignant potential.[93] However, reports from large institutions showed that extraskeletal myxoid  chondrosarcoma has significant malignant potential, especially if patients are monitored for a long time.[94,95] Patients tend to have slow protracted courses. Nodal involvement has been well described. Local recurrence (57%) and metastatic spread to lungs (26%) have been reported.[95] Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma is a multinodular neoplasm.  The rounded cells are arranged in cords and strands in a chondroitin sulfate myxoid background. Several cytogenetic abnormalities have been identified (see Table 2), with the most frequent being the  EWSR1::NR4A3 gene fusion.[96] Treatment options for extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma include the following: Surgery. Radiation therapy. Aggressive local control and resection of metastases led to OS rates of 87% at 5 years and 63% at 10 years. Tumors were relatively resistant to radiation therapy.[94] The therapeutic benefit of chemotherapy has not been established. There may be potential genetic targets for small molecules, but these need to be studied as part of a clinical trial. In an adult study, six of ten patients who received sunitinib achieved partial responses.[97] Almost one-fifth of patients with Ewing sarcoma will present with nonbone primary sites (extraosseous). Treatment for this tumor is the same as it is for patients with bone primary tumors.[98] For more information, see Ewing Sarcoma and Undifferentiated Small Round Cell Sarcomas of Bone and Soft Tissue Treatment. Desmoplastic small round cell tumor is a rare primitive sarcoma. Desmoplastic small round cell tumor most
frequently involves the peritoneum in the abdomen, pelvis, and/or peritoneum into the scrotal sac, but it may occur in the kidney or other solid organs.[99-103] 
Dozens to hundreds of intraperitoneal implants are often found. The tumor occurs predominantly in males (85%) and may spread to the lungs and elsewhere.[103,104] A large single-institution series of 65 patients compared computed tomography (CT) scans (n = 54) with positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scans (n = 11). PET-CT scans had very few false-negative results and detected metastatic sites missed on conventional CT scans.[104] Cytogenetic studies of these tumors have demonstrated the recurrent translocation t(11;22)(p13;q12), which has been characterized as a fusion of the WT1 and EWSR1 genes.[102,105] The EWSR1::WT1 fusion confirms the diagnosis of desmoplastic small round cell tumor. The average tumor mutational burden is low for desmoplastic small round cell tumor (<1 mutation per megabase), and recurring gene alterations other than the EWSR1::WT1 fusion are uncommon.[106] A small percentage of cases (approximately 3%) have activating mutations in FGFR4, with amplification of FGFR4 observed at similar frequency.[106,107] Inactivating mutations in TP53 and ARID1A are observed in a small percentage of desmoplastic small round cell tumor cases.[106,107] The overall prognosis for patients with desmoplastic small round cell tumor remains extremely poor, with reported rates of death at 90%. Greater than 90% tumor resection either at presentation or after preoperative chemotherapy may be a favorable prognostic factor for OS.[108,109]; [110][Level of evidence C1] Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and complete resection (near 100%) is associated with improved outcome.[103,111] There is no standard approach to the treatment of desmoplastic small round cell tumor. Treatment options for desmoplastic small round cell tumor include the following: Multimodality therapy (chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy). Surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Other treatment options. Complete surgical resections are rare and usually performed in highly specialized centers, but are critical for any improved survival. Successful treatment modalities include neoadjuvant Ewing-type chemotherapy, followed by complete surgical resection of the extensive intra-abdominal tumors, followed by total abdominal radiation therapy. With this multimodality approach, survival can be achieved in 30% to 40% of patients at 5 years.[99,100,108,112-115] HIPEC is a local treatment method that may control more of the microscopic intra-abdominal  disease.  The theory is that the heated chemotherapy that is instilled in the abdominal cavity after surgical resection (at the time of surgery) provides synergistic cytotoxicity to any microscopic cells remaining in the abdomen.[116] The addition of HIPEC to complete surgical resection (cytoreductive surgery) is a new technique first applied to children in 2006 in a phase I clinical trial. Cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC for desmoplastic small round cell tumors is part of a multidisciplinary approach and is only being done in highly specialized centers.   Surgeries can last more than 12 hours, and technical aspects of this unique tumor resection should be considered.[116] Evidence (surgery with HIPEC): A single-institution phase II study showed HIPEC to be a potentially promising addition to complete surgical resection. Fourteen patients with desmoplastic small round cell tumor  and five patients with other sarcomas were enrolled.  These highly selected patients had tumor limited to the abdominal cavity. They demonstrated a partial response to neoadjuvant Ewing-type chemotherapy,  had complete surgical resections and received HIPEC using cisplatin. They also received adjuvant total-abdominal radiation therapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.[116]  With this standardized approach, patients with desmoplastic small round cell tumors had an OS rate of 80% at 30 months and 40% at 50 months.  Patients with desmoplastic small round cell tumors without liver metastasis had no intra-abdominal recurrences, whereas 87% of patients with liver metastasis or portal disease had a recurrence. In a retrospective study  from centers in France, patients were treated with cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC.  Twenty-two patients were selected, and the median age at diagnosis was 14.8 years (range, 4.2–17.6 years). Seven patients had peritoneal mesotheliomas, seven patients had desmoplastic small round cells tumors, and eight patients had other histological tumor types. A complete macroscopic resection (CC-0, where CC is completeness of cytoreduction) was achieved in 16 cases (73%). Four of the seven patients with desmoplastic small round cell tumors had complete resections.[117][Level of evidence C1] Sixteen patients (72%) relapsed after a median time of 9.6 months (range, 1.4–86.4 months). Nine patients (41%) died of relapsed disease after a median time of 5.3 months (range, 0.1–36.1 months). Another study from France reviewed the use of cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC for the treatment of patients with desmoplastic small round cell tumors who had disease limited to the abdomen.  In 107 patients with desmoplastic small round cell tumors, 48 had no extraperitoneal metastasis and underwent cytoreductive surgery. Of 48 patients (mean age, 22 years), 38 (79%) received preoperative and/or postoperative chemotherapy, and 23 (48%) received postoperative whole-abdominopelvic radiation therapy. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy was administered to 11 patients (23%); two patients received early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC)  and nine patients received HIPEC.[118] After a median follow-up of 30 months, the median OS of the entire cohort was 42 months. The 2-year OS rate was 72%, and the 5-year OS rate was 19%. The 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 30%, and the 5-year DFS rate was 12%. Whole-abdominopelvic radiation therapy was the only variable associated with longer peritoneal recurrence-free survival and DFS after cytoreductive surgery. Of 11 patients who received intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC or EPIC), six different chemotherapy regimens were used.  The survival or outcome of this group is not reported in the manuscript. The influence of HIPEC/EPIC on OS and DFS was not statistically significant, but standardized regimens were not used in all patients,  making results difficult to determine. A single-institutional retrospective study reported on nine patients (median age, 19 years) with desmoplastic small round cell tumor. Most patients had widespread disease, including four patients with extra-abdominal disease and five patients with liver involvement. These nine patients underwent ten cytoreductive and HIPEC treatments. Additionally, seven patients also received radiation therapy, and three patients underwent stem cell transplant.[119] The 3-year relapse-free survival rate was 13%, and the  OS rate was 55%. Therapy was often associated with prolonged hospitalizations. Long-term parenteral nutrition was required in eight patients for a median of 261 days. Other long-term complications included gastroparesis (n = 1), small bowel obstruction (n = 3), and hemorrhagic cystitis (n = 2). With this standardized approach, patients with desmoplastic small round cell tumors had an OS rate of 80% at 30 months and 40% at 50 months. Patients with desmoplastic small round cell tumors without liver metastasis had no intra-abdominal recurrences, whereas 87% of patients with liver metastasis or portal disease had a recurrence. Sixteen patients (72%) relapsed after a median time of 9.6 months (range, 1.4–86.4 months). Nine patients (41%) died of relapsed disease after a median time of 5.3 months (range, 0.1–36.1 months). After a median follow-up of 30 months, the median OS of the entire cohort was 42 months. The 2-year OS rate was 72%, and the 5-year OS rate was 19%. The 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 30%, and the 5-year DFS rate was 12%. Whole-abdominopelvic radiation therapy was the only variable associated with longer peritoneal recurrence-free survival and DFS after cytoreductive surgery. Of 11 patients who received intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC or EPIC), six different chemotherapy regimens were used.  The survival or outcome of this group is not reported in the manuscript. The influence of HIPEC/EPIC on OS and DFS was not statistically significant, but standardized regimens were not used in all patients,  making results difficult to determine. The 3-year relapse-free survival rate was 13%, and the  OS rate was 55%. Therapy was often associated with prolonged hospitalizations. Long-term parenteral nutrition was required in eight patients for a median of 261 days. Other long-term complications included gastroparesis (n = 1), small bowel obstruction (n = 3), and hemorrhagic cystitis (n = 2). The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research analyzed patients with desmoplastic small round cell tumor in their registry who received consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell reconstitution.[120]  While this retrospective registry analysis suggested some benefit to this approach, other investigators have abandoned the approach because of excessive toxicity and lack of efficacy.[108] A single-institution study reported that five of five patients with recurrent desmoplastic small round cell tumor had partial responses to treatment with the combination of vinorelbine, cyclophosphamide, and temsirolimus.[121] Malignant rhabdoid tumors  were first described in children with renal tumors in 1981. These tumors were later found in a variety of extrarenal sites.  These tumors are uncommon and highly malignant, especially in children younger than 2 years. For more information, see the Rhabdoid Tumors of the Kidney section in Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors Treatment. Extrarenal (extracranial) rhabdoid tumors account for 2% of soft tissue sarcomas in patients younger than 20 years (see Table 1). The first sizeable series of children with extrarenal extracranial malignant rhabdoid tumor of soft tissues came from 26 patients enrolled on the IRS I through III studies during a review of pathology material. Only five patients (19%) were alive without disease beyond 2 years.[122] Investigation of children with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors of the brain, as well as those with renal and extrarenal malignant rhabdoid tumors, found germline and acquired mutations of the SMARCB1 gene in all 29 tumors tested.[123] Rhabdoid tumors may be associated with germline mutations of the SMARCB1 gene and may be inherited from an apparently unaffected parent.[124] This observation was extended to 32 malignant rhabdoid tumors at all sites in patients whose mean age at diagnosis was 12 months.[125] Germline analysis should be considered for individuals of all ages with rhabdoid tumors. Genetic counseling is also part of the treatment plan, given the low-but-actual risk of familial recurrence. In cases of mutations, parental screening should be considered, although such screening carries a low probability of positivity. Prenatal diagnosis can be performed in situations where a specific SMARCB1 mutation or deletion has been documented in the family.[124] To date, there is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of surveillance for patients with rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome type 1 caused by loss-of-function germline SMARCB1 mutations.   However, because of the aggressive nature of the tumors with significant lethality and young age of onset in SMARCB1 carriers with truncating mutations, consensus recommendations have been developed.  These recommendations were developed by a group of pediatric cancer genetic experts (including oncologists, radiologists, and geneticists). They have not been formally studied to confirm the benefit of monitoring patients with germline SMARCB1 mutations.  Given the potential survival benefit of surgically resectable disease, it is postulated that early detection might improve OS.[126-128] Surveillance for patients with germline SMARCB1 mutations includes the following: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every 3 months from birth (or diagnosis) until age 5 years. Abdominal ultrasonography with a  focus on the kidneys every 3 months. For information about SMARCB1 and rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome type 1, see Rhabdoid Tumor Predisposition Syndrome Type 1. Young age and metastatic disease at presentation are associated with poor outcome in  children with extracranial rhabdoid tumors. One study that used data from the National Cancer Database identified 202 patients (aged younger than 18 years) with non–central nervous system (CNS) malignant rhabdoid tumors. The primary site of the malignant rhabdoid tumor was soft tissue (46%), kidney (45%), and liver (9%).[129] The 1-year OS rate was 48.8%, and the 5-year OS rate was 35.9%. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that age younger than 1 year and presence of metastasis were negative prognostic indications (P = .058). In the cohort of surgical patients (n = 143), there was a trend for an association between the presence of residual disease and a clinically significant worse outcome (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.88–2.69; P = .13). A SEER study examined 229 patients with renal, CNS, and extrarenal malignant rhabdoid tumor. Patient age of 2 to 18 years, limited extent of tumor, and delivery of radiation therapy were shown to affect the outcome favorably compared with other patients (P < .002 for each comparison).  Site of the primary tumor was not prognostically significant.  The OS rate was 33% at 5 years.[130] A European registry for extracranial rhabdoid tumors identified 100 patients from 14 countries between 2009 and 2018.[131]  Half of the patients were younger than 1 year at diagnosis. In 30 patients (30%), the tumor was located in the kidneys. Extracranial, extrarenal malignant rhabdoid tumor was found in 70% of patients (70 of 100), and the most common locations were in the cervical region, thoracic region, and liver.  Nine patients demonstrated synchronous tumors. Distant metastases at diagnosis were present in 35% of patients (35 of 100).  SMARCB1 germline mutations were detected in 21% of patients (17 of 81 evaluable). The 5-year OS rate was 45.8% (± 5.4%), and the EFS rate was 35.2% (± 5.1%).  In an adjusted multivariate model, presence of a germline mutation, metastasis, and lack of a gross-total resection were the strongest significant negative predictors of outcome. Treatment options for extrarenal (extracranial) rhabdoid tumor include the following:[132-134][Level of evidence C1] Surgical removal when possible. Chemotherapy as used for soft tissue sarcomas (but no single regimen is currently accepted as best). Radiation therapy. Responses to alisertib have been documented in four patients with CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors.[135] For more information about CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, see Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor Treatment. Information about NCI-supported clinical trials can be found on the NCI website. For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the ClinicalTrials.gov website. The following is an example of a national and/or institutional clinical trial that is currently being conducted: PEPN2121 (NCT05286801) (Tiragolumab and Atezolizumab for the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory SMARCB1- or SMARCA4-Deficient Tumors): This study is evaluating the combination of a PD-L1 targeting antibody (atezolizumab) with a TIGIT targeting antibody (tiragolumab) for patients with SMARCB1- or SMARCA4-deficient tumors. Patients with extrarenal (extracranial) rhabdoid tumors may be eligible for this study. PEComas occur in various rare gastrointestinal, pulmonary, gynecological, and genitourinary sites. Soft tissue, visceral, and gynecological PEComas are more commonly seen in middle-aged female patients and are usually not associated with the tuberous sclerosis complex.[136] The disease course may be indolent. Benign PEComas are common in patients with tuberous sclerosis, an autosomal dominant syndrome that also predisposes to renal cell cancer and brain tumors. Tuberous sclerosis is caused by germline inactivation of either TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3), and the same tumor suppressor genes are inactivated somatically in sporadic PEComas.[137] Inactivation of either gene results in stimulation of the mTOR pathway, providing the basis for the treatment of nonsurgically curable tumors with similar genetic inactivation (lymphangioleiomyomatosis and angiomyolipoma) with mTOR inhibitors.[138,139] A small proportion of PEComas have TFE3 rearrangements with fusions involving various genes, including SFPQ and RAD51B.[140] Most PEComas have a benign clinical course, but malignant behavior has been reported and can be predicted based on the size of the tumor, mitotic rate, and presence of necrosis.[141] There are no standard treatment options. Treatment may include surgery or observation followed by surgery when the tumor is large.[142] In tumors with evidence of mTORC1 activation and TSC1 or TSC2 loss, including lymphangioleiomyomatosis and angiomyolipoma,[138] clinical activity using mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus, has been well documented. In a small case series, three adult patients with PEComas responded to sirolimus.[143] In a phase II trial, 34 patients with metastatic or locally advanced malignant PEComas were treated with sirolimus protein-bound particles for injectable suspension  (albumin-bound) (nab-sirolimus). Of the 31 patients eligible for efficacy analysis, 12 (39%) had a response (1 complete response and 11 partial responses), 16 (52%) had stable disease, and 3 (10%) had progressive disease. Responses were rapid and durable. The median duration of response was not reached after a median follow-up of 2.5 years. Treatment was ongoing for 7 of 12 patients who responded to treatment (range, 5.6 months to longer than 47.2 months). Tumor mutational profiling was completed for 25 specimens. Eight of nine patients with TSC2 mutations responded to treatment, while only 2 of 16 patients without TSC2 mutations responded. In addition, responses were noted in 10 of 17 patients with phospho-S6 (pS6) expression. No response was noted in eight patients without pS6 expression. The absence of pS6 expression reflects the lack of mTORC1 activation.[144][Level of evidence C1] In 2021, the FDA approved nab-sirolimus for adult patients with PEComas. From 1972 to 2006, patients with undifferentiated soft tissue sarcoma were eligible for participation in rhabdomyosarcoma  trials coordinated by the IRS group and the COG. The rationale was that patients with undifferentiated soft tissue sarcoma had sites of disease and outcomes that were similar to those in patients with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Therapeutic trials for adults with soft tissue sarcoma include patients with undifferentiated soft tissue sarcoma and other histologies, which are treated similarly, using ifosfamide and doxorubicin, and sometimes with other chemotherapy agents, surgery, and radiation therapy. In the COG ARST0332 (NCT00346164) trial, patients with high-grade undifferentiated sarcoma were treated with an ifosfamide- and doxorubicin-based regimen.  Results for the patients with high-grade undifferentiated sarcoma were reported together with all high-grade soft tissue sarcomas in the trial. The estimated 5-year EFS rate was 64% and the OS rate was 77% for sarcomas classified as high grade by the Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre Le Cancer (FNCLC).[5][Level of evidence C1] In a report of 32 patients with undifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas who were enrolled on the ARST0332 (NCT00346164) trial, the median age at  enrollment was 13.6 years, and two-thirds of the patients were male. The most common primary sites were the paraspinal region and extremities. Five patients presented with metastatic disease.[145] The 5-year EFS rate was 71%, and the OS rate was 83%. Of the nine children with low-risk disease (localized low-grade resected disease or localized high-grade disease <5 cm resected with negative margins) who were treated with surgery or radiation therapy only, the 5-year EFS rate was 65% and the OS rate was 100%,  suggesting that patients with low-risk disease can be salvaged if the disease recurs. The remaining 23 patients had either intermediate-risk disease (resected high-grade tumor >5 cm, unresected high-grade tumor >5 cm)   or high-risk disease (metastasis to lymph nodes or distant sites) and were treated with chemoradiation therapy and delayed surgery when feasible. The 5-year EFS rate was 73%, and the OS estimate was 77%. Copy number aberrations were common, most frequently involving loss of 1p (25%), gain of 1q (25%), gain of chromosome 8 (25%), and gain of chromosome 2 (16%).  These alterations were more commonly seen in patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk tumors, and there was a strong association between loss of chromosome 1p or gain of chromosome 1q and inferior clinical outcomes. Co-occurrence of  1q gain and 1p loss was associated with a particularly poor clinical outcome (5-year EFS and OS rates of 20%). Next-generation sequencing identified oncogenic fusions in eight of ten tumor samples, which included BCOR and CIC rearrangements, as well as COL1A1::PDGFB, KIAA1549::BRAF, and SAMD5::SASH1 gene fusions. At one time, malignant fibrous histiocytoma was the single most common histotype among adults with soft tissue sarcomas.  Since it was first recognized in the early 1960s, malignant fibrous histiocytoma has been controversial, in terms of both its histogenesis and its validity as a clinico-pathological entity. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification no longer includes malignant fibrous histiocytoma as a distinct diagnostic category but rather as a subtype of an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.[146,147] This entity accounts for 2% to 6% of all childhood soft tissue sarcomas.[148] These tumors occur mainly in the second decade of life. In a series of ten patients, the median age was 10 years, and the tumor was most commonly located in the extremities. In this series, all tumors were localized, and five of nine patients (for whom follow-up was available) were alive and in first remission.[148] In another series of 17 pediatric patients with malignant fibrous histiocytoma, the median age at diagnosis was 5 years and the extremities were involved in eight cases.[149]  All patients with metastatic disease died, and two patients experienced a clinical response to a doxorubicin-based regimen. For more information about the treatment of malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone, see Osteosarcoma and Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma of Bone Treatment. These tumors can arise in previously irradiated sites or as a second malignancy in patients with retinoblastoma.[150] An analysis of 70 patients who were diagnosed with malignant fibrous histiocytosis of no specific type, storiform or pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma, pleomorphic sarcoma, or undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma showed a highly complex karyotype with no specific recurrent aberrations.[151] Undifferentiated sarcomas with 12q13–15 amplification, including MDM2 and CDK4, are best classified as dedifferentiated liposarcomas.[151] The relationship between this tumor and the family of undifferentiated/unclassified tumors with spindle cell morphology remains relatively undefined. For information about the treatment of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of bone, see Osteosarcoma and Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma of Bone Treatment. Treatment options for recurrent or refractory pleomorphic sarcoma include the following: Pembrolizumab. The Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration conducted a phase II trial of the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients aged 18 years and older with recurrent soft tissue sarcoma.[152][Level of evidence C3] Seven of 40 patients (18%) with soft tissue sarcoma had an objective response. Four of ten patients (40%) with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, two of ten patients (20%) with liposarcoma, and one of ten patients (10%) with synovial sarcoma had objective responses. No patients with leiomyosarcoma (n = 10) had an objective response.

angiosarcomas, which are highly malignant.[1] Malignant vascular tumors include the following subtypes: Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma not otherwise specified (NOS). Angiosarcoma. Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma was first described in soft tissue by Weiss and Enzinger in 1982.  These tumors can occur in younger patients, but the peak incidence is in the fourth and fifth decades of life.  The number of pediatric patients reported in the literature is limited. Epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas can have an indolent or very aggressive course, with an overall survival rate of 73% at 5 years. There are case reports of patients with untreated multiple  lesions who have a very benign course. However, other patients have a very aggressive course. Some pathologists have tried to stratify patients to evaluate risks and adjust treatment, but more research is needed.[2-8] A multi-institutional case series reported on 24 patients aged 2 to 26 years with epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas.[9][Level of evidence C2]  Most patients presented with multiorgan disease. Progression was seen in 63% of patients, with a mean time to progression of 18.4 months (range, 0–72 months). The presence of effusions, tumor size larger than 3 cm, and a high mitotic index (>3 mitoses/50 high-power fields) have been associated with unfavorable outcomes.[4] Common sites of involvement are liver alone (21%), liver plus lung (18%), lung alone (12%), and bone alone (14%).[4,10,11] Clinical presentation depends on the site of involvement, as follows: Liver: Hepatic nodules have central vascularity on ultrasound, contrast-enhancing lesions by computed tomography, and low T1 signal and moderate T2 signal on magnetic resonance imaging.  These may be incidental findings in asymptomatic patients, but most patients commonly present with signs or symptoms of cholestasis, including pruritus, jaundice, or scleral icterus. Lung: Pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma may be an asymptomatic finding on chest x-ray or be associated with pleuritic pain, hemoptysis, anemia, and fibrosis. Bone: Bone metastasis may be associated with pathological fracture.  On x-rays, they are well-defined osteolytic lesions and can be multiple or solitary. Soft tissue: Thirty percent of soft tissue cases are associated with metastases. When present, metastatic disease can be very aggressive and have a limited response to chemotherapy. Skin: Cutaneous lesions can be raised and nodular or can be warm, red-brown plaques. WWTR1::CAMTA1 gene fusions have been found in most patients. Less commonly, YAP1::TFE3 gene fusions have  been reported.[2] These gene fusions are not directly targetable with current medications.    Monoclonality has been described in multiple liver lesions, suggesting a metastatic process. Histologically, these lesions are characterized as epithelioid lesions arranged in nests, strands, and trabecular patterns, with infrequent vascular spaces. Features that may be associated with aggressive clinical behavior include cellular atypia, one or more mitoses per 10 high-power fields, an increased proportion of spindled cells, focal necrosis, and metaplastic bone formation.[4] Treatment options for epithelioid hemangioendothelioma include the following: Observation. Surgery. Immunotherapy. Targeted therapy. Chemotherapy. Radiation therapy. For indolent cases, observation is warranted.  Surgery is performed when resection is possible.   Liver transplant has been used with aggressive liver lesions, both with and without metastases.[4,12-14] For more aggressive cases, several different drugs have been used, including interferon, thalidomide, sorafenib, pazopanib, and sirolimus.[12,15,16]     The most aggressive cases are treated with angiosarcoma-type chemotherapy. A multi-institutional case series reported on 24 patients aged 2 to 26 years with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.[9][Level of evidence C2] Three patients who were treated with sirolimus achieved stable disease or a partial response for more than 2.5 years. A report from 2020 that investigated sirolimus treatment in children aimed to add to the previous experience of sirolimus in adults. A retrospective review identified six pediatric patients with disseminated epithelioid hemangioendothelioma who were treated with sirolimus.[17] Four of the six patients demonstrated partial responses or disease stabilization. A report from the European Soft Tissue Sarcoma study group analyzed ten patients with localized disease and one patient with metastatic disease from two studies.[18] The median age was 14.3 years (range, 9.0–18.8 years). Local therapy was initial primary surgery in seven patients, and five patients received systemic therapy. No patients received radiation therapy. After a median follow-up of 50 months (range, 6–176 months) for living patients, nine patients remained alive and off therapy and two patients died. The 5-year progression-free survival rate was 77.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.5%–93.9%). The 5-year overall survival rate was 74.1% (95% CI, 28.1%–93.0%). Patients or families who desire additional disease-directed therapy should consider entering trials of novel therapeutic approaches because no standard agents have demonstrated clinically significant activity. Regardless of whether a decision is made to pursue disease-directed therapy at the time of progression, palliative care remains a central focus of management. This ensures that quality of life is maximized while attempting to reduce symptoms and stress related to the terminal illness.

Angiosarcomas  are rare (accounting for 2% of sarcomas), aggressive, vascular tumors that can arise in any part of the body but is more common in soft tissues.  Angiosarcoma has an estimated incidence of 2 cases per 1 million people. In the United States, it affects approximately 600 people  annually, who are typically aged 60 to 70 years.[19] Angiosarcomas are extremely rare in children. It is unclear if the pathophysiology of angiosarcomas in children differs from that of angiosarcomas in adults. Cases have been reported in neonates and toddlers, with presentation of multiple cutaneous lesions and liver lesions, some of which are GLUT1 positive.[20-23] Most angiosarcomas involve the skin and superficial soft tissue, although the liver, spleen, and lung can be affected; bone is rarely affected. Nomenclature of these liver lesions has been difficult and confusing with use of outdated terminology proposed in 1971 (e.g., type I hemangioendothelioma: infantile hemangioma; type II hemangioendothelioma: low-grade angiosarcoma; type III hemangioendothelioma: high-grade angiosarcoma).[21]  A report of eight cases of  liver angiosarcomas in children highlighted the misuse of the term hemangioendothelioma and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of these tumors.[24] Established risk factors include the following:[25] Vinyl chloride exposure. Radiation exposure. Chronic lymphedema from any cause, including Stewart-Treves syndrome. Angiosarcomas are largely aneuploid tumors.  The rare cases of angiosarcoma that arise from benign lesions such as hemangiomas have a distinct pathway that needs to be investigated.  MYC amplification is seen in radiation-induced angiosarcoma.  KDR mutations and FLT4 amplifications have been seen with a frequency of less than 50%.[25] Histopathological diagnosis can be very difficult because there can be areas of varied atypia.  A common feature of angiosarcoma is an irregular network of channels in a dissective pattern along dermal collagen bundles.  There is varied cellular shape, size, mitosis, endothelial multilayering, and papillary formation.  Epithelioid cells can also be present. Necrosis and hemorrhage are common.  Tumors stain for factor VIII, CD31, and CD34. Some liver lesions can mimic infantile hemangiomas and have focal GLUT1 positivity.[21] Treatment options for angiosarcoma include the following: Surgery (localized disease). Radiation therapy (localized cutaneous disease in adults). Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy (metastatic disease). Palliative care. Localized disease can be cured by aggressive surgery. Complete surgical excision
appears to be crucial for the long-term survival of patients with angiosarcomas and lymphangiosarcomas, despite evidence
of tumor shrinkage in some patients who were treated with local or systemic therapy.[22,26-28] Data on liver transplant for localized angiosarcomas are limited.[29][Level of evidence C1] Evidence (surgery): A review of 222 patients (median age, 62 years; range, 15–90 years) reported the following:[28] An overall disease-specific survival (DSS) rate of 38% at 5 years.  The 5-year DSS rate was 44% in 138 patients with localized, resected tumors but only 16% in 43 patients with metastases at diagnosis. One case report suggested that liver transplant may contribute to prolonged disease-free survival.[30][Level of evidence C2] An overall disease-specific survival (DSS) rate of 38% at 5 years. The 5-year DSS rate was 44% in 138 patients with localized, resected tumors but only 16% in 43 patients with metastases at diagnosis. Localized disease, especially cutaneous angiosarcomas, can be treated with radiation therapy or combined chemotherapy (e.g., paclitaxel) and radiation therapy.[31] Most of these reported cases are in adults.[32] When radiation is used, the doses are high (50–70 Gy), the cutaneous volumes are extensive because of the infiltrating nature of the disease, and regional (draining) nodes are often included, even if clinically negative.[33,34] Because of these factors, radiation therapy is rarely used to treat children. Multimodal treatment with surgery, systemic chemotherapy, and radiation therapy is used for metastatic disease, although it is rarely curative.[34,35]    Disease control is the objective in patients with metastatic angiosarcomas. Published progression-free survival is between 3 months and 7 months,[36] and the median overall survival (OS) is 14 to 18 months.[37]  In both adults and children, the 5-year OS rates are between 20% and 35%.[22,23,38] One child who was diagnosed with angiosarcoma secondary to malignant transformation from infantile hemangioma responded to treatment with bevacizumab (a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor) combined with systemic chemotherapy.[20,35] Biologic agents that inhibit angiogenesis have shown activity in adults with angiosarcomas.[21,38] There is one case report of a pediatric patient with metastatic cardiac angiosarcoma who was successfully treated with conventional chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and targeted therapies, including pazopanib.[39] Regardless of whether a decision is made to pursue disease-directed therapy at the time of progression, palliative care remains a central focus of management. This ensures that quality of life is maximized while attempting to reduce symptoms and stress related to the terminal illness. Patients or families who desire additional disease-directed therapy should consider entering trials of novel therapeutic approaches because no standard agents have demonstrated clinically significant activity.

For treatment options, see the individual tumor type sections of the summary. The prognosis for children with metastatic soft tissue sarcomas is poor.[1-6]
These children should receive combined treatment with chemotherapy,
radiation therapy, and surgical resection of pulmonary metastases.  In a
prospective randomized trial, chemotherapy with vincristine, dactinomycin,
doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide, with or without dacarbazine, led to tumor
responses in one-third of patients with unresectable or metastatic disease. 
However, the estimated 4-year survival rate was poor. Less  than one-third
of children survived.[6-8] Targeted (stereotactic body) radiation therapy is an option for sites of metastasis, particularly the lung.[9] Targeted radiation therapy is also an option for local control or sites of metastasis, including the lungs, bones, and brain,[10,11] particularly in patients for whom the morbidity of resection is a concern or whose life expectancy is limited.[9] In a prospective trial of children with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, patients were randomly assigned to receive  multiagent chemotherapy with or without the addition of bevacizumab.[12]  There was no difference in event-free survival or overall survival between the two study arms. Generally, a surgical procedure, with resection of all gross disease, should be considered for children with isolated pulmonary metastases.[13] For patients with multiple or recurrent pulmonary metastases, additional surgical procedures can be performed if the morbidity is deemed acceptable. In a retrospective review, patients with synovial sarcoma and pulmonary metastases who underwent complete resection of all metastatic lung lesions had better survival than did patients who did not undergo complete resections.[13][Level of evidence C1] Formal segmentectomy, lobectomy, and mediastinal
lymph node dissection are unnecessary.[14] An alternative approach is focused radiation therapy (fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy), which has been successfully used in adults to control lesions.  The estimated 5-year
survival rate after thoracotomy for pulmonary metastasectomy has ranged from
10% to 58% in adult studies.[9] Demetri GD, Elias AD: Results of single-agent and combination chemotherapy for advanced soft tissue sarcomas. Implications for decision making in the clinic.

prognosis for patients with progressive or recurrent disease is poor. No
prospective trial has demonstrated that enhanced local control of
pediatric soft tissue sarcomas will ultimately improve survival.  Therefore,
treatment should be individualized for the site of recurrence,
biological characteristics of the tumor (e.g., grade, invasiveness, and size), previous therapies, and individual patient considerations. 
All patients with recurrent tumors should consider participating in clinical trials. Published results of two studies addressed the outcomes of children with  relapsed synovial sarcoma. Most patients in one study had distant relapse (29 of 44 patients),[1] while most patients in the second study had local relapse (27 of 37 patients).[2] Distant recurrence was a poor prognostic variable, while tumor resectability at relapse (as manifested by extremity recurrence) was associated with a better outcome in both studies. Resection is the standard treatment for recurrent pediatric
nonrhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcomas.  If the patient has not yet
received radiation therapy, postoperative radiation should be considered after local
excision of the recurrent tumor.  Limb-sparing procedures with postoperative
brachytherapy have been evaluated in adults but have not been studied extensively
in children.  For some children with extremity sarcomas who have received
previous radiation therapy, amputation may be the only therapeutic option. Treatment options for progressive or recurrent disease include the following: Surgery. Chemotherapy. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors. Evidence (surgery): Surgical excision of local recurrence.An Italian review of 73 patients with recurrent malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors found that most relapses were local.[3][Level of evidence C1]Multivariate analysis showed that the factors associated with improved survival were no tumor invasiveness at initial diagnosis (stage T1), time of recurrence more than 12 months after initial diagnosis, and achievement of a second complete response with surgical removal of the recurrence(s). Only 15.8% of patients who had complete surgical excisions of local recurrence(s) were alive at 5 years. Surgical excision of isolated pulmonary occurrence.Pulmonary metastasectomy may achieve prolonged disease control for some patients.[4] A large, retrospective analysis of patients with recurrent soft tissue sarcoma showed that isolated local relapse had a better prognosis and that resection of pulmonary metastases improved the probability of survival.[5]In 31 children and adolescents younger  than 23 years  with pulmonary metastases from synovial sarcoma, complete resection of lung metastases appeared to prolong survival when compared with ten other patients who were not candidates for metastasectomy.[6][Level of evidence C1] Surgical excision of local recurrence followed by radiation therapy or brachytherapy (if no previous radiation therapy was given). Limb amputation (only for some children with extremity sarcomas that have already received radiation therapy). An Italian review of 73 patients with recurrent malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors found that most relapses were local.[3][Level of evidence C1]Multivariate analysis showed that the factors associated with improved survival were no tumor invasiveness at initial diagnosis (stage T1), time of recurrence more than 12 months after initial diagnosis, and achievement of a second complete response with surgical removal of the recurrence(s).

Pazopanib has been approved for use in patients with recurrent soft tissue sarcoma.  The clinical trial that led to the approval was limited to adults. The study demonstrated disease stabilization and prolonged time to progression; it did not demonstrate improved overall survival.[11]A phase I trial of pazopanib reported one partial response in a patient with desmoplastic small round cell tumor and prolonged disease stabilization in eight patients with recurrent sarcoma.[12][Level of evidence B4]  One 13-year-old boy and one 14-year-old girl with multiply recurrent synovial sarcoma and lung metastases had responses to pazopanib for 14 and 15 months, respectively.[13][Level of evidence C2] A phase I trial of pazopanib reported one partial response in a patient with desmoplastic small round cell tumor and prolonged disease stabilization in eight patients with recurrent sarcoma.[12][Level of evidence B4] One 13-year-old boy and one 14-year-old girl with multiply recurrent synovial sarcoma and lung metastases had responses to pazopanib for 14 and 15 months, respectively.[13][Level of evidence C2] Evidence (immune checkpoint inhibitors): Pembrolizumab. The Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration conducted a phase II trial of the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients  aged 18 years and older with recurrent soft tissue sarcoma.[14][Level of evidence C3]Seven of 40 patients (18%) with soft tissue sarcoma had an objective response. Four of ten patients (40%) with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, two of ten patients (20%) with liposarcoma, and one of ten patients (10%) with synovial sarcoma had objective responses. No patients with leiomyosarcoma (n = 10) had an objective response. Seven of 40 patients (18%) with soft tissue sarcoma had an objective response. Four of ten patients (40%) with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, two of ten patients (20%) with liposarcoma, and one of ten patients (10%) with synovial sarcoma had objective responses. No patients with leiomyosarcoma (n = 10) had an objective response. Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)–supported clinical trials can be found on the NCI website.

new information becomes available.  This section describes the latest
changes made to this summary as of the date above. General Information About Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma Added text about the results of a European paediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma Study Group study of patients with nonrhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcomas. These patients were retrospectively assessed to evaluate the impact of indeterminate pulmonary nodules identified on chest computed tomography (cited Giraudo et al. as reference 33). Added text to state that sentinel lymph node biopsies were encouraged but not required for the ARST0332 study. A sentinel lymph node biopsy was not done in most patients because they had clinically enlarged nodes. Of note, three patients without clinical evidence of lymph node metastasis at study entry experienced lymph node basin failure. One of these patients had three lymph nodes in two different lymph node basins sampled by sentinel lymph node biopsy that were pathologically negative. Treatment Option Overview for Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma Added text to state that with longer follow-up, the investigators of the ARST1321 trial were able to analyze the secondary objectives of overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). At a median follow-up of 3.3 years, the 3-year EFS rate for all patients in the intent-to-treat analysis was 52.5% for patients who received pazopanib and 50.6% for those who did not. The 3-year OS rate was 75.7% for patients who received pazopanib and 65.4% for the control group (cited Weiss et al. as reference 51). Treatment of Fibroblastic and Myofibroblastic Tumors Added text to state that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved nirogacestat for the treatment of patients aged 18 years and older with progressive desmoid tumors who require systemic therapy. The approval was based on a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted by a consortium. Treatment of Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors Added text to state that the molecular pathogenesis of adult malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors demonstrates inactivating mutations in at least three pathways, including NF1, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and PRC2 complex core components. Similar alterations have been reported in pediatric tumors (cited Agaram et al. as reference 4). Added text about the histological and genomic results of a Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center study of archival and consultation material from 64 pediatric and young adult patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

Past Events  About DCB  Progress   Past Events  Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) expand protein structure/function, enabling dynamic adaptation to cell-intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli. However, there are knowledge gaps in understanding how these modifications work in a coordinated way to drive or suppress tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapy. To discuss the role of post-translational modifications in tumor biology, NCI held a virtual workshop on Sept. 22 – 23, 2022. The meeting brought together researchers in key and diverse areas of PTMs (including ubiquitination, phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and glycosylation) to discuss the current status of science, important advances, and challenges that may stand in the way of new directions and opportunities when attempting to unravel the complexities of tumor biology. Experts in the field were invited to present their research and discuss how to better integrate these disparate – yet interconnected areas of PTM research as integral building blocks underlying tumor biology from bench to bedside.

Our members are singularly focused on eradicating the impact of cancer, including disparities and inequities, in our community and beyond through the most advanced clinical care, innovative transdisciplinary research, dynamic training and mentorship, and trusted partnerships with community organizations, families, and civic leaders. The mission of the SKCC is to improve the lives of cancer patients and their families through compassion, innovation, and breakthrough discoveries. Areas of scientific focus include cancer risk and control, implementation science, cancer health disparities, clinical trials, molecular oncology regulation and approaches, translational and cellular oncology, and immune cell regulation and targeting. Research in each of these areas is needed to successfully unravel the cancer problems within our Catchment Area and enable us to leverage our distinct expertise in understanding the needs of our community, moving catchment-relevant discoveries quickly from the bench to the bedside, and then sharing our findings and implementing interventions within the community. The SKCC provides access to advanced clinical trials and comprehensive treatment strategies for patients throughout the Delaware Valley via 5 Advanced Care Hub sites in Center City Philadelphia, South Jersey, Northeast Philadelphia, and the northern suburbs of Philadelphia. Our Catchment Area consists of seven contiguous counties, four in Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, Montgomery, Delaware, and Chester) and three in New Jersey (Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester). Notably, the region has approximately 6.1 million residents; if it were a state, it would be the 20th most populous state in the U.S. SKCC is devoted to eradicating cancer by leveraging its strengths in research and clinical care to: discover the molecular basis of cancer development and progression; develop this knowledge into effective new prevention, detection, and treatment strategies; educate patients, clinicians, and scientists; devise innovative strategies to decrease cancer health disparities; and deliver the most advanced care. Some SKCC researcher accomplishments include: Novel insights into drug administration schedules to elicit more complete responses in melanoma models.  Publishing a practice-changing consensus statement that provides a comprehensive and balanced clinical approach to genetic referrals and testing so that providers can offer patients an opportunity to make informed decisions regarding genetic testing, screening, and personalized treatment.  Establishing cancer center-wide priorities for the greater Philadelphia area, emphasizing cancer health disparities, as well as genetic and behavioral factors influencing cancer risk.  SKCC’s efforts in community outreach and engagement have demonstrated an expertise in aligning cancer services and trials to the needs of the surrounding community.  With our SKCC Mobile Screening Van we bring cancer screenings out into underserved neighborhoods.  SKCC’s renowned interdisciplinary teams of researchers, clinicians, and population scientists accelerate discovery in the following program areas: Cancer Risk and Control, Molecular Oncology Regulation Approaches, Translational and Cellular Oncology, and Immune Regulation Targets. Some of SKCC’s novel initiatives include: The Aging in Cancer Institute builds upon SKCC’s clinical and research expertise in the field of aging and cancer. Specifically, this center addresses the entire cancer continuum through five primary pillars. Insights gained in one pillar will directly inform advances in another: Basic science research that will explore the aging-associated molecular changes that contribute to cancer susceptibility, progression, and metastasis;  Translational research that will turn the discoveries uncovered by the basic science arm into novel therapies and clinical trials for a population that has been historically underrepresented in clinical trials;  Population health research that will provide a better understanding of the underlying drivers of cancer disparities;  Clinical care delivery, which will improve the access, quality, and delivery of specialized cancer care that focuses on factors impacting older adults; and  Training and education that will provide significant opportunities to increase the number of specialists and caregivers capable of caring for older adults with cancer.  The Philadelphia Prostate Cancer Biome Project is a long-term, multi-discipline, multi-institutional collaboration that studies the region’s prostate-cancer biome, the biological-sociological-psychological ecosystem where it flourishes. The project partners with top cancer centers, hospitals, and universities in the Philadelphia region to collect and process bio-specimens and patient/population data. Patients are tracked over years to understand the many factors that predict outcomes in the prostate cancer biome. The Melanoma Research Institute was to established as the premier research institute for melanoma in the United States and offer the most comprehensive and advanced spectrum of research and care in the treatment of melanoma. It consists of two arms: The ocular melanoma arm deals with an extremely rare and lethal cancer of the eye involving the iris, ciliary body, choroid, or conjunctiva.  The cutaneous melanoma arm deals with the more familiar cancer of the skin, which develops when melanocytes, the cells that give the skin its tan or brown color, grow uncontrollably.  The interdisciplinary collaborations fostered benefit melanoma researchers and patients alike.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shows ZnO nanowires synthesized by vapor-solid process. Growth of aligned arrays of nanowires can be used for biosensing, manipulation of cells, and converting mechanical energy into electricity for powering nanodevices. In the fight against cancer, half of the battle is won based on its early diagnosis. Cancer identified in its early stages leads to a significantly higher 5-year survival rate and a typically less aggressive treatment course. Given the limitations of classic imaging techniques and morphologic analysis of tissues or cells in achieving early diagnosis of cancer, nanotechnology has the potential of providing new molecular contrast agents and in vitro assays to enable earlier and more accurate initial diagnosis as well as ongoing monitoring of cancer patient treatments, as illustrated in the diagram below. Nano-enable biosensors (as exemplified in the right image) exhibit exceptional sensitivity, specificity, and the capacity to recognize multiple molecules, making them suitable for detecting extracellular cancer biomarkers like cancer-associated proteins, circulating tumor DNA, and extracellular vesicles. Nanomaterials also come into play for the sensitive detection of cancer cells. For example, the isolation and characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) presents challenges due to their relatively low abundance; nevertheless, diverse nanomaterials, including magnetic nanoparticles, nanowires, and dendrimers, are extensively developed and studied for precise CTCs detection. Additionally, nanoparticle probes accumulate within tumor tissues and can serve as contrast agents for in vivo cancer imaging, enhancing anatomical structure visualization. Lastly, these nanotechnology-based approaches also play a crucial role in measuring therapy response, optimizing treatment strategies. Schematic illustration of nanotechnology applications in cancer detection and diagnosis. Nanotechnology-based diagnostic methods are being developed as promising tools for cancer detection that are real-time, convenient, and cost-effective. Source: Ye Zhang, Maoyu Li, Xiaomei Gao, Yongheng Chen, and Ting Liu, Journal of Hematology & Oncology, 2019.  The discovery of cancer-associated molecular alterations in blood at multiple molecular spaces (genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome) has led to new opportunities in early cancer detection. Nanotechnology-enabled liquid biopsy diagnostic devices offer the capability for the enrichment and subsequent omics analysis of the blood-circulating ‘cancer fingerprints’ with high selectivity and sensitivity. Through well-established fabrication techniques (e.g., lithography), compact devices or point-of-care systems can be crafted. These diagnostic tools utilize biochemical reactions to interrogate the presence, activity, or concentration of specific biological molecules in a bodily fluid sample. These reactions, such as antigen-antibody binding, hybridization of DNA fragments, or ligand adhering to cell surface epitopes, can subsequently be transformed into measurable detection signals using methods like optical, magnetic, or electronic means. DEAL Barcode Assay to Enable Precision Medicine. The image shows the DEAL (DNA-encoded antibody library) barcode assay, a high-density test for human blood proteins. It is designed to reveal unique disease markers, allowing for precision medicine approach to treatment. Many cancers detection and diagnostic devices utilizing nanoparticles have been developed (as evident in the table below). A pioneering study (Jwa-min Nam, Shad Thaxton, and Chad A. Mirkin, Science, 2003) introduced an ultrasensitive method for detecting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) down to 3 attomolar sensitivity level, which is six orders of magnitude more sensitive as compared to the clinically accepted conventional assays. This approach, known as the bio-barcode assay, employs a sandwich immunoassay design by combining magnetic nanoparticles with PSA-specific antibodies and DNA-encoded gold nanoparticles. The elevated PSA level can be used to trigger prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted PET imaging (Steven P. Rowe, Michael A. Gorin, and Martin G. Pomper, Annual Review of Medicine, 2019) for prostate cancer detection and therapy monitoring. Another sandwich immunoassay device has been designed, relying on DNA-encoded antibody libraries (DEAL, as shown in the right figure). DEAL technique (Rong Fan, et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2008; Chao Ma, et al., Nature Methods, 2011) uses DNA-directed immobilization of antibodies in microfluidic channels that can convert a pre-patterned single stranded DNA barcode microarray into an antibody microarray. This enables multiplex immunoassays, on-chip blood separation, and measurement of large protein panels directly from blood. Looking forward, new advances in the coupling of complex microfluidics and nanoscale materials offer the potential to derive comprehensive in vitro cancer diagnostic insights from a patient sample. Examples of nanomaterial detection platforms used in cancer liquid biopsy studies. EpCAM, epithelial cell adhesion molecule. Adapted from Lois Gardner, Kostas Kostarelos, Parag Mallick, Caroline Dive, and Marilena Hadjidemetriou, Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology, 2022 Current imaging methods, such as MRI, PET, and CT, can detect cancers with sensitivity levels sufficient only to provide detection by the time thousands of cancer cells have grown and may have spread. Nanotechnology based imaging contrast agents for conventional imaging modalities, now in development and translation, offer the ability to specifically target and significantly amplify the ability of in vivo tumor detection. Moreover, current nanoscale imaging platforms are enabling novel imaging modalities not traditionally utilized for clinical cancer treatment and diagnosis, for example photoacoustic tomography (PAT), Raman spectroscopic imaging, and multimodal imaging (i.e., contrast agents designed for several imaging modalities, simultaneously). Nanotechnology enables these imaging platforms by designing nanoparticles simultaneously carrying multiple components (e.g., conventional contrast agents) and ligands to target tumor cells. NCI-funded research has produced many notable examples of nanotechnology-based imaging agents over the past decade. For instance, researchers have engineered multimodal nanoparticles that can delineate the margins of brain tumors before and during surgery (Moritz F Kircher, et al., Nature Methods, 2012). These nanoparticles, combining MRI, PAT, and Raman detection, are capable of tracking tumor growth and surgical staging via MRI, but also grant the surgeon the ability to visualize brain tumor down to the single cancer cell level, increasing the potential for precise removal of cancerous tissue (as shown in the figure below). Similarly, scientists have designed silica-hybrid nanoparticles (‘C-dots’) capable of providing both PET and optical imaging contrast in the same platform (Evan Philips, et al., Science Trans Med., 2016). These nanoparticles can actively target to metastatic melanoma with cRGDY peptides, making it successfully through initial clinical trials. Principle of a triple-modality MRI-photoacoustic-Raman imaging nanoparticle. The nanoparticle is intravenously injected. In contrast to contemporary contrast agents that wash out of the tumor region quickly, the nanoparticles are stably internalized within the brain tumor cells. This enables the whole range of imaging studies from pre-operative MRI for surgical planning to intra-operative imaging during the surgery, all with a single injection. T1-weighted MRI depicts the outline of the tumor due to the T1-shortening effect of the gadolinium. During the surgery, photoacoustic imaging with its greater depth penetration and 3D imaging capability guides gross resection, while Raman imaging directs the resection of the microscopic tumor at the margins. In addition, Raman would be used for rapid ex vivo confirmation of clean margins in the operating room instead of the time-consuming analysis of frozen sections. A longstanding vision in cancer nanotechnology is the capability to simultaneously image and administer therapy in vivo, leading to the emergence of ‘theranostic’ nanoscale platforms. A diagnostic platform for pancreatic cancer has been designed to break through the fibrotic stromal tissue of these tumors (Lei Zhu, Hui Mao, and Lily Yang, WIREs Nanomedicine and Nanobiotechnology, 2022). Once past this barrier, the nanoparticles, containing magnetic iron cores, facilitate MRI contrast for diagnosis and concurrently deliver small-molecule drugs directly to cancer cells for treatment.  Multiplexed blood protein profiling via magneto-nano chip in vitro diagnostics. Imaged here is a microfluidic magneto-nano chip with 8 by 8 sensors arrays and 8 microfluidic channels. These chips are being developed to monitor protein profiles in blood samples from cancer patients to improve therapeutic effectiveness. The key to this technology is the use of magnetic nanoparticles to label protein molecules which are then accurately counted by the magneto-nano chip. The cornerstone of precise and prognostic medical care lies in measuring an individual patient’s response to targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or surgery as their disease progresses. Accurate and relevant disease monitoring can allow for optimizing treatment regimens (e.g., therapeutic course correction, use of drug combinations, and fine-tuning drug doses), preemptive clinical decision making (e.g., separating therapeutic responders from non-responders), and patient stratification for clinical trials. In vivo imaging, tissue biopsy, and in vitro diagnostics are all available for this purpose. Being able to track cancer cell death in vivo is important for delivering effective dosing regimens and/or precisely administering novel therapies. For example, scientist have designed a target-enabled in situ ligand assembly (TESLA) nanoparticle system, in which nanoparticles can self-assemble within the body when cleaved by enzymes from therapy-induced cell death (Deju Ye, et al., Nature Chemistry, 2014). These nanoparticles also carry various image contrast agents to monitor (PET, MRI, etc.) local tumor response to therapies. While tissue biopsy serves as the traditional gold standards for cancer identification, it is an invasive procedure and has limited space sampling capability to track disease progression relative to the course of therapy, effectively. In vitro cancer diagnosis and monitoring introduces a simpler method of tracking therapy response by leveraging the tumor’s shed biological material (e.g., cells, DNA, other cancer-specific biomolecules) circulating in blood over time. They typically exist at incredibly low concentrations as compared to other blood components, the need arises for specific and highly sensitive tools to detect, capture, and purify them. Nanotechnology is paving the way for the realization of these essential tools. For instance, microfluidic nano chips (one example shown in the right figure) have been developed for multiplex protein detection of potential cancer markers at sub-picomolar concentration level (Sebastian J. Osterfeld, et, al., PNAS, 2008) and for CTCs detection with over 95% sensitivity (Millicent Lin, et al., Accounts of Chemical Research, 2014), enabling effective monitoring of cells and proteins in blood samples to understand and enhance therapy outcomes.

Stage IA2: A very small amount of cancer that can only be seen with a microscope is found in the tissues of the cervix. The deepest point of tumor invasion is more than 3 millimeters but not more than 5 millimeters.EnlargeMillimeters (mm). A sharp pencil point is about 1 mm, a new crayon point is about 2 mm, and a new pencil eraser is about 5 mm. Stage IB is subdivided based on the size of the tumor and the deepest point of tumor invasion. Stage IB1: The tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller and the deepest point of tumor invasion is more than 5 millimeters. EnlargeStage IB1 cervical cancer. The cancer is 2 centimeters or smaller and is more than 5 millimeters deep. Stage IB2: The tumor is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters. EnlargeStage IB2 and IB3 cervical cancer. In stage IB2, the cancer is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters. In stage IB3, the cancer is larger than 4 centimeters. Stage IB3: The tumor is larger than 4 centimeters. EnlargeTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches). Learn about treatment of stage I cervical cancer. Learn about treatment of cervical cancer during pregnancy. In stage II, cervical cancer has spread to the upper two-thirds of the vagina or to the tissue around the uterus. Stage II is subdivided based on how far the cancer has spread. EnlargeStage II cervical cancer. In stages IIA1 and IIA2, cancer has spread from the cervix to the upper two-thirds of the vagina but has not spread to the tissue around the uterus. In stage IIA1, the cancer is 4 centimeters or smaller. In stage IIA2, the cancer is larger than 4 centimeters. In stage IIB, cancer has spread from the cervix to the tissue around the uterus. Stage IIA: Cancer has spread from the cervix to the upper two-thirds of the vagina but has not spread to the tissue around the uterus. Stage IIA is further divided based on the size of the tumor: Stage IIA1: The tumor is 4 centimeters or smaller. Stage IIA2: The tumor is larger than 4 centimeters.

Learn about treatment of stage II cervical cancer. Learn about treatment of cervical cancer during pregnancy. In stage III, cervical cancer has spread to the lower third of the vagina and/or to the pelvic wall, and/or has caused kidney problems, and/or involves lymph nodes. Stage III is subdivided based on how far the cancer has spread. Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the lower third of the vagina but has not spread to the pelvic wall. EnlargeStage IIIA cervical cancer. Cancer has spread to the lower third of the vagina but has not spread to the pelvic wall. Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the pelvic wall; and/or the tumor has become large enough to block one or both ureters or has caused one or both kidneys to get bigger or stop working. EnlargeStage IIIB cervical cancer. Cancer has spread to the pelvic wall and/or the tumor has become large enough to block one or both ureters or has caused one or both kidneys to get bigger or stop working. Stage IIIC: Stage IIIC is divided into stages IIIC1 and IIIC2, based on the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes. EnlargeStage IIIC cervical cancer. In stage IIIC1, cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis. In stage IIIC2, cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the abdomen near the aorta. Learn about treatment of stage III cervical cancer. Learn about treatment of cervical cancer during pregnancy. In stage IV, cervical cancer has spread beyond the pelvis, or has spread to the lining of the bladder or rectum, or has spread to other parts of the body. Stage IV is subdivided into stages IVA and IVB, based on where the cancer has spread. Stage IVA: Cancer has spread to nearby pelvic organs, such as the bladder or rectum. EnlargeStage IVA cervical cancer.  Cancer has spread to nearby pelvic organs, such as the bladder or rectum. Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver, lungs, bones, or distant lymph nodes. EnlargeStage IVB cervical cancer. Cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes, lung, liver, or bone. Stage IV is also called metastatic cancer. Metastatic cancer happens when cancer cells travel through the lymphatic system or blood and form tumors in other parts of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if cervical cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually cervical cancer cells.

Sharing their images could help clinical doctors and radiologists everywhere better identify and treat brain injuries caused by radiation. Assistant Professor, Radiology and Radiological Science  Principal Investigator, Responsive Imaging BioSensors and BioEngineering Lab, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine  Dr. Ethel Ngen (she/her) was a child when her uncle developed a brain tumor and experienced cognitive problems from treatment. “It just really changed him,” Ethel said. Now, Ethel studies radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI)—damage to the brain caused by radiation treatment. RIBI can have devastating effects on memory and learning, especially for survivors of childhood cancer. Ethel’s team uses MRI to find biomarkers that indicate brain damage from radiation. “The biomarkers are like a car’s check engine lights,” Ethel said. “Physicians can see there’s a problem when the lights are on, and they can try to fix it. When the lights are off, they know everything is OK.” Imaging data from Ethel’s lab, used alongside neurological testing, could help doctors better recognize and treat RIBI and understand who is at risk of injury—an urgent need as increasing numbers of children with brain tumors are surviving into adulthood and living with RIBI.

Childhood Cancer Data Initiative  Global Cancer Research   Childhood Cancer Data Initiative  Gregory Aune, M.D., Ph.D. Stephanie Edlund Distinguished Professor in Pediatric Cancer Research and St. Baldrick’s Scholar, Greehey Children’s Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio Advances in cancer treatment mean that, today, more than 4 out of 5 children diagnosed with cancer will survive and remain cancer free for at least 5 years after diagnosis. Many of these children will ultimately be considered cured of their cancer. However, the chances of either developing a life-threatening health problem or dying early as a result of their treatment approaches 60% by age 50. Potential late effects include cardiovascular disease, second cancers, and premature menopause. As a childhood cancer survivor, pediatric oncologist, and cancer research advocate, Greg Aune knows firsthand that cancer is not an acute disease but a lifelong problem. At age 16, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma and was successfully treated after undergoing a year of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. However, he has experienced many late effects from his treatment, including infertility, stroke, and life-threatening heart disease. “My story is one of persistent personal frustration with the toxicities of chemotherapy and radiation,” said Greg. In fact, his cancer experience is what motivated him to become a pediatric oncologist and physician–scientist. Anthracyclines, some of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs in pediatric oncology, can severally damage the heart. Greg’s research focuses on identifying biomarkers of toxicity in the heart caused by these powerful drugs. Understanding this relationship will help researchers develop new strategies for detecting, preventing, treating, and managing cardiac disease in the large number of pediatric cancer survivors treated with anthracyclines. The goal of current pediatric oncology research is to identify better targeted therapies that are less toxic. “My hope is that we’re at a point where we can not only offer children with cancer an opportunity for a cure, but a long life free of debilitating health conditions,” said Greg. “In no other field of medicine would the late effects we see in pediatric cancer be considered an unqualified success,” he added. Until less-toxic therapies are developed, it is imperative for health care teams to educate the 420,000 U.S. survivors of childhood cancer about the possible late effects of their treatment and empower them to be active participants in their lifelong post-cancer health care.

T!tle : Kim Rathmell becomes NCI director - NCI
ur$ : https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2023/rathmell-nci-director
d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  W. Kimryn Rathmell begins work as 17th director of the National Cancer Institute   News Releases   Posted:
December 18, 2023  240-760-6600 NCI Director Dr. W. Kimryn Rathmell W. Kimryn Rathmell, M.D., Ph.D., began work today as the 17th director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). A renowned kidney cancer expert and influential leader in cancer research and patient care, Dr. Rathmell was selected by President Biden to succeed Monica M. Bertagnolli, M.D., who left NCI to become the NIH director on November 9. “I want to officially welcome Dr. Rathmell to the National Cancer Institute on her first day as director,” said Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. “Dr. Rathmell begins her new role at an important time. The President and First Lady reignited the Biden Cancer Moonshot℠ to dramatically accelerate progress in the fight against cancer—and NCI is helping to lead the charge. Dr. Rathmell brings decades of experience helping to advance research and drive innovation to improve care for patients. She joins an extraordinary team already doing great work to prevent, detect, and treat cancer to make sure Americans are living longer, healthier lives. I look forward to working closely with Dr. Rathmell in the months and years ahead to help end cancer as we know it.” “I am thrilled to welcome Dr. Rathmell to NIH, and I know she is the right leader at the right time for NCI,” said Dr. Bertagnolli. “She is a fantastic combination of researcher and clinician who deeply understands the process of translating lab research into effective cancer treatments. NCI is in great hands to actualize the brighter future we all want for people with cancer.” Dr. Rathmell comes to NCI from Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, where she served as the Hugh Jackson Morgan Chair in Medicine, chair of the Department of Medicine, and physician-in-chief. Before joining Vanderbilt University, she served on the faculty of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dr. Rathmell is an accomplished physician–scientist, from treating patients with kidney cancer to conducting research that has advanced how scientists understand the molecular and genetic drivers of the disease. For example, as a member of The Cancer Genome Atlas, a joint effort of NCI and NIH’s National Human Genome Research Institute to catalog genetic mutations of cancers, Dr. Rathmell contributed to the discovery that a rare form of kidney cancer called chromophobe renal cell carcinoma is caused in part by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. More recently, her genomic studies have led to the identification of new molecular biomarkers to help detect and treat kidney cancers earlier. An advocate for research into rare forms of kidney cancer, such as renal medullary carcinoma (RMC), Dr. Rathmell co-founded the nonprofit organization RMC Alliance, which supports patients with renal medullary carcinoma. This rare form of kidney cancer predominantly affects young adults and adolescents of African descent who carry one copy of the sickle cell hemoglobin gene. In addition to publishing hundreds of scientific articles about her research studies, Dr. Rathmell has also published on ethical issues such as cancer drug shortages and conflicts of interest in scientific publishing. Beyond her research interests, she is deeply committed to mentoring and developing the next generation of physician–scientists. “I have held NCI in the highest regard throughout my experience as a cancer researcher, translational investigator, practicing clinician, and educator,” said Dr. Rathmell. “This opportunity to help the institute achieve greater heights for progress against cancer is an incredible honor. “With all of today’s advances in technology and science, and the truly talented and committed people at NCI and across the cancer research and care community, I believe it is possible to end cancer as we know it in our lifetime,” she continued. “We must empower early-career and established scientists from diverse backgrounds so they can work together and break down barriers to deliver the biggest, boldest science possible and produce advances that benefit everyone who faces cancer. We have an extraordinarily talented and committed workforce, and I know we are up to the challenge.” Dr. Rathmell, who will lead NCI in pursuing the goals of President Biden’s Cancer Moonshot initiative, has served on NCI’s Board of Scientific Advisors since 2018. She was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2022 and to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2023. She served as president of the American Society for Clinical Investigation in 2019. Dr. Rathmell earned bachelor’s degrees in biology and chemistry from the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls, Iowa. She received a Ph.D. in biophysics and an M.D. from Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. She completed an internal medicine internship at the University of Chicago and a residency and fellowship in medical oncology at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. In 2022, she completed a Master of Management in Health Care from Vanderbilt’s Owen Graduate School of Management. With Dr. Rathmell’s arrival, Douglas R. Lowy, M.D., who has been serving as NCI’s acting director, will resume his role as principal deputy director of NCI and will continue his work as chief of the Laboratory of Cellular Oncology in NCI’s Center for Cancer Research.

What is fluoride, and where is it found? What is water fluoridation? When did water fluoridation begin in the United States? Can fluoridated water cause cancer? Where can people find additional information on fluoridated water? What is fluoride, and where is it found? Fluoride is the name given to a group of compounds that are composed of the naturally occurring element fluorine and one or more other elements. Fluorides are present naturally in water and soil at varying levels. In the 1940s, scientists discovered that people who lived where drinking water supplies had naturally occurring fluoride levels of approximately 1 part fluoride per million parts water or greater (>1.0 ppm) had fewer dental caries (cavities) than people who lived where fluoride levels in drinking water were lower. Many more recent studies have supported this finding (1). It was subsequently found that fluoride can prevent and even reverse tooth decay by inhibiting bacteria that produce acid in the mouth and by enhancing remineralization, the process through which tooth enamel is “rebuilt after it begins to decay (1, 2). In addition to building up in teeth, ingested fluoride accumulates in bones. What is water fluoridation? Water fluoridation is the process of adding fluoride to the water supply so the level reaches approximately 0.7 ppm, or 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water; this is the optimal level for preventing tooth decay (1). When did water fluoridation begin in the United States? In 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan, adjusted the fluoride content of its water supply to 1.0 ppm and thus became the first city to implement community water fluoridation. By 2008, more than 72 percent of the U.S. population served by public water systems had access to fluoridated water (3). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers fluoridation of water one of the greatest achievements in public health in the 20th century. Can fluoridated water cause cancer? A possible relationship between fluoridated water and cancer risk has been debated for years. The debate resurfaced in 1990 when a study by the National Toxicology Program, part of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, showed an increased number of osteosarcomas (bone tumors) in male rats given water high in fluoride for 2 years (4). However, other studies in humans and in animals have not shown an association between fluoridated water and cancer (5–7). In a February 1991 Public Health Service (PHS) report, the agency said it found no evidence of an association between fluoride and cancer in humans. The report, based on a review of more than 50 human epidemiologic (population) studies produced over the past 40 years, concluded that optimal fluoridation of drinking water “does not pose a detectable cancer risk to humans” as evidenced by extensive human epidemiologic data reported to date (5). In one of the studies reviewed for the PHS report, scientists at NCI evaluated the relationship between the fluoridation of drinking water and the number of deaths due to cancer in the United States during a 36-year period, and the relationship between water fluoridation and number of new cases of cancer during a 15-year period. After examining more than 2.2 million cancer death records and 125,000 cancer case records in counties using fluoridated water, the researchers found no indication of increased cancer risk associated with fluoridated drinking water (6). In 1993, the Subcommittee on Health Effects of Ingested Fluoride of the National Research Council, part of the National Academy of Sciences, conducted an extensive literature review concerning the association between fluoridated drinking water and increased cancer risk. The review included data from more than 50 human epidemiologic studies and six animal studies. The Subcommittee concluded that none of the data demonstrated an association between fluoridated drinking water and cancer (6). A 1999 report by the CDC supported these findings. The CDC report concluded that studies to date have produced “no credible evidence” of an association between fluoridated drinking water and an increased risk for cancer (2). Subsequent interview studies of patients with osteosarcoma and their parents produced conflicting results, but with none showing clear evidence of a causal relationship between fluoride intake and risk of this tumor. In 2011, researchers examined the possible relationship between fluoride exposure and osteosarcoma in a new way: they measured fluoride concentration in samples of normal bone that were adjacent to a person’s tumor. Because fluoride naturally accumulates in bone, this method provides a more accurate measure of cumulative fluoride exposure than relying on the memory of study participants or municipal water treatment records. The analysis showed no difference in bone fluoride levels between people with osteosarcoma and people in a control group who had other malignant bone tumors (7). More recent population-based studies using cancer registry data found no evidence of an association between fluoride in drinking water and the risk of osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma (8, 9). Where can people find additional information on fluoridated water? The CDC has information at https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/index.html on standards for and surveillance of current fluoridated water supplies in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency has more information about drinking water and health at https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water.

		  cells form in the tissues of the breast. A family history of breast cancer and other factors can increase a man's risk of breast cancer. Male breast cancer is sometimes caused by inherited gene
		  mutations (changes). Men with breast cancer usually have lumps that can be felt. Tests that examine the breasts are used to diagnose breast cancer in men. If cancer is found, tests are done to study the cancer cells. Survival for men with breast cancer is similar to survival for
		  women with breast cancer. Certain factors affect  prognosis
		  (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Breast cancer may occur in
		  men. Breast cancer may occur in men at any age, but it usually occurs in men between 60 and 70 years of age. Male breast cancer makes up less
		  than 1% of all cases of breast cancer. The following types of breast cancer are found in men: Infiltrating ductal
			 carcinoma: Cancer that has spread beyond the
			 cells lining
			 ducts in the breast. This is the most common type of breast cancer in men. Ductal carcinoma in
			 situ: Abnormal cells that are found in the lining of a duct;
			 also called intraductal carcinoma. Inflammatory breast
			 cancer: A type of cancer in which the breast looks red and
			 swollen and feels warm. Paget disease of the
			 nipple: A tumor that
			 has grown from ducts beneath the nipple onto the surface of the nipple. Lobular carcinoma in
		  situ (abnormal cells found in one of the
		  lobes or sections of the breast),
		  which sometimes occurs in women, has not been seen in men. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for breast
		  cancer in men may include the following: Treatment with radiation  therapy to your breast/chest. Having a disease linked to high levels of
			 estrogen in the body, such as
			 cirrhosis (liver disease) or Klinefelter syndrome (a
			 genetic disorder). Having one or more female relatives who have had breast cancer. Having mutations (changes) in genes such as BRCA2. The genes in cells carry the hereditary information that is received from a person’s parents. Hereditary breast cancer makes up about 5% to 10% of all breast cancer. Some mutated genes related to breast cancer, such as BRCA2, are more common in certain ethnic groups.

Men who have a mutated gene related to breast cancer have an increased risk of this disease. There are tests that can detect (find) mutated genes. These genetic tests are sometimes done for members of families with a high risk of cancer. See the following PDQ summaries  for more information: Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers Breast Cancer Prevention Breast Cancer Screening Lumps and other signs may be caused by male breast cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: A lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm area. A change in the size or shape of the breast. A dimple or puckering in the skin of the breast. A nipple turned inward into the breast. Fluid from the nipple, especially if it's bloody. Scaly, red, or swollen skin on the breast, nipple, or areola (the dark area of skin around the nipple). Dimples in the breast that look like the skin of an orange, called peau d’orange. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and health history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Clinical breast exam (CBE): An exam of the breast by a doctor or other health professional. The doctor will carefully feel the breasts and under the arms for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. Mammogram: An x-ray of the breast. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of both breasts. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.  There are four types of biopsies to check for breast cancer: Excisional
			 biopsy: The removal of an entire lump of tissue.Incisional
				  biopsy: The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue.  Core
			 biopsy: The removal of tissue using a wide needle.Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy: The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle. Excisional
			 biopsy: The removal of an entire lump of tissue. Incisional
				  biopsy: The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue. Core
			 biopsy: The removal of tissue using a wide needle. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy: The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle. Decisions about the best treatment are based on the results of these tests. The tests give information about: How quickly the cancer may grow. How likely it is that the cancer will spread through the body. How well certain treatments might work. How likely the cancer is to recur (come back). Tests include the following: Estrogen and progesterone receptor test: A test to measure the amount of estrogen and progesterone (hormones) receptors in cancer tissue.  If there are more estrogen and progesterone receptors than normal, the cancer is called estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive. This type of breast cancer may grow more quickly. The test results show whether treatment to block estrogen and progesterone may stop the cancer from growing. HER2 test:  A laboratory test to measure how many HER2/neu genes there are and how much HER2/neu protein is made in a sample of tissue. If there are more HER2/neu genes or higher levels of HER2/neu protein than normal, the cancer is called HER2/neu positive.  This type of breast cancer may grow more quickly and is more likely to spread to other parts of the body. The cancer may be treated with drugs that target the HER2/neu protein, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Survival for men with breast cancer is similar to that for women
		  with breast cancer when their stage
		  at diagnosis is the same. Breast
		  cancer in men, however, is often diagnosed at a later stage. Cancer found at a
		  later stage may be less likely to be cured. The prognosis and treatment options depend on
		  the following: The stage
		  of the cancer (the size of the tumor and whether it is in the breast only or has spread to lymph nodes or other places
		  in the body). The type of breast cancer. Estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor levels in the tumor tissue. Whether the cancer is also found in the other breast. The man’s age
		  and general health. Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back). After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find
		  out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the
		  body. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. In breast cancer, stage is based on the size and location of the primary tumor, the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body, tumor grade, and whether certain biomarkers are present. The TNM system is used to describe the size of the primary tumor and the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body.Tumor (T).  The size and location of the tumor.Lymph Node (N). The size and location of lymph nodes where cancer has spread. Metastasis (M). The spread of cancer to other parts of the body. The grading system is used to describe how quickly a breast tumor is likely to grow and spread. Biomarker testing is used to find out whether breast cancer cells have certain receptors. The TNM system, the grading system, and biomarker status are combined to find out the breast cancer stage. Talk to your doctor to find out what your breast cancer stage is and how it is used to plan the best treatment for you. The treatment of male breast cancer depends partly on the stage of the disease. Tumor (T).  The size and location of the tumor. Lymph Node (N). The size and location of lymph nodes where cancer has spread. Metastasis (M). The spread of cancer to other parts of the body. After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done
		  to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of
		  the body. This process  is called staging.
		  The information gathered from the
		  staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage  in order to plan treatment. Breast cancer in men is staged
		  the same as it is in women.  The spread of cancer from the breast to
		  lymph nodes and other parts of the
		  body appears to be similar in men and women. The following tests and procedures may be used in 
         the staging process: Sentinel lymph node biopsy:  The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node in a group of lymph nodes to receive lymphatic drainage from the primary tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor.  A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor.  The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes.  The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed.   A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.  If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes. Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Bone scan: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if breast cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually breast cancer cells. The disease is metastatic breast cancer, not bone cancer. To plan the best treatment and understand your prognosis, it is important to know the breast cancer stage. There are 3 types of breast cancer stage groups: Clinical Prognostic Stage is used first to assign a stage for all patients based on health history, physical exam, imaging tests (if done), and biopsies. The Clinical Prognostic Stage is described by the TNM system, tumor grade, and biomarker status (ER, PR, HER2). In clinical staging, mammography or ultrasound is used to check the lymph nodes for signs of cancer. Pathological Prognostic Stage is then used for patients who have surgery as their first treatment. The Pathological Prognostic Stage is based on all clinical information, biomarker status, and laboratory test results from breast tissue and lymph nodes removed during surgery. Anatomic Stage is based on the size and the spread of cancer as described by the TNM system. The Anatomic Stage is used in parts of the world where biomarker testing is not available. It is not used in the United States. For breast cancer, the TNM system describes the tumor as follows: TX: Primary tumor cannot be assessed. T0: No sign of a primary tumor in the breast. Tis: Carcinoma in situ. There are 2 types of breast carcinoma in situ:Tis (DCIS): DCIS is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct. The abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast. In some cases, DCIS may become invasive breast cancer that is able to spread to other tissues. At this time, there is no way to know which lesions can become invasive.Tis (Paget disease): Paget disease of the nipple is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the skin cells of the nipple and may spread to the areola. It is not staged according to the TNM system. If Paget disease AND an invasive breast cancer are present, the TNM system is used to stage the invasive breast cancer. T1: The tumor is 20 millimeters or smaller. There are 4 subtypes of a T1 tumor depending on the size of the tumor:T1mi: the tumor is 1 millimeter or smaller.T1a: the tumor is larger than 1 millimeter but not larger than 5 millimeters.T1b: the tumor is larger than 5 millimeters but not larger than 10 millimeters.T1c: the tumor is larger than 10 millimeters but not larger than 20 millimeters. T2: The tumor is larger than 20 millimeters but not larger than 50 millimeters. T3: The tumor is larger than 50 millimeters. T4: The tumor is described as one of the following:T4a: the tumor has grown into the chest wall.T4b: the tumor has grown into the skin—an ulcer has formed on the surface of the skin on the breast, small tumor nodules have formed in the same breast as the primary tumor, and/or there is swelling of the skin on the breast.T4c: the tumor has grown into the chest wall and the skin.T4d: inflammatory breast cancer—one-third or more of the skin on the breast is red and swollen (called peau d'orange). Tis (DCIS): DCIS is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct. The abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast. In some cases, DCIS may become invasive breast cancer that is able to spread to other tissues. At this time, there is no way to know which lesions can become invasive. Tis (Paget disease): Paget disease of the nipple is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the skin cells of the nipple and may spread to the areola. It is not staged according to the TNM system. If Paget disease AND an invasive breast cancer are present, the TNM system is used to stage the invasive breast cancer. T1mi: the tumor is 1 millimeter or smaller. T1a: the tumor is larger than 1 millimeter but not larger than 5 millimeters. T1b: the tumor is larger than 5 millimeters but not larger than 10 millimeters. T1c: the tumor is larger than 10 millimeters but not larger than 20 millimeters. T4a: the tumor has grown into the chest wall. T4b: the tumor has grown into the skin—an ulcer has formed on the surface of the skin on the breast, small tumor nodules have formed in the same breast as the primary tumor, and/or there is swelling of the skin on the breast. T4c: the tumor has grown into the chest wall and the skin. T4d: inflammatory breast cancer—one-third or more of the skin on the breast is red and swollen (called peau d'orange). When the lymph nodes are removed by surgery and studied under a microscope by a pathologist, pathologic staging is used to describe the lymph nodes. The pathologic staging of lymph nodes is described below. NX: The lymph nodes cannot be assessed. N0:  No sign of cancer in the lymph nodes, or tiny clusters of cancer cells not larger than 0.2 millimeters in the lymph nodes. N1: Cancer is described as one of the following:N1mi: cancer has spread to the axillary (armpit area) lymph nodes and is larger than 0.2 millimeters but not larger than 2 millimeters.N1a: cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. N1b: cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor, and the cancer is larger than 0.2 millimeters and is found by sentinel lymph node biopsy. Cancer is not found in the axillary lymph nodes.N1c: cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer is also found by sentinel lymph node biopsy in the lymph nodes near the breastbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor. N2: Cancer is described as one of the following:N2a: cancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters.N2b: cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone and the cancer is found by imaging tests. Cancer is not found in the axillary lymph nodes by sentinel lymph node biopsy or lymph node dissection. N3: Cancer is described as one of the following:N3a: cancer has spread to 10 or more axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters, or cancer has spread to lymph nodes below the collarbone.N3b: cancer has spread to 1 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer has also spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone and the cancer is found by imaging tests; or cancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer has also spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor, and the cancer is  larger than 0.2 millimeters and is found by sentinel lymph node biopsy.N3c: cancer has spread to lymph nodes above the collarbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor. N1mi: cancer has spread to the axillary (armpit area) lymph nodes and is larger than 0.2 millimeters but not larger than 2 millimeters. N1a: cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. N1b: cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor, and the cancer is larger than 0.2 millimeters and is found by sentinel lymph node biopsy. Cancer is not found in the axillary lymph nodes. N1c: cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer is also found by sentinel lymph node biopsy in the lymph nodes near the breastbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor. N2a: cancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters.

N3b: cancer has spread to 1 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer has also spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone and the cancer is found by imaging tests; or cancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer has also spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor, and the cancer is  larger than 0.2 millimeters and is found by sentinel lymph node biopsy. N3c: cancer has spread to lymph nodes above the collarbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor. or cancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer has also spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor, and the cancer is  larger than 0.2 millimeters and is found by sentinel lymph node biopsy. When the lymph nodes are checked using mammography or ultrasound, it is called clinical staging. The clinical staging of lymph nodes is not described here. M0: There is no sign that cancer has spread to other parts of the body. M1: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body, most often the bones, lungs, liver, or brain. If cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes, the cancer in the lymph nodes is larger than 0.2 millimeters. The cancer is called metastatic breast cancer. The grading system describes a tumor based on how abnormal the cancer cells and tissue look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer cells are likely to grow and spread. Low-grade cancer cells look more like normal cells and tend to grow and spread more slowly than high-grade cancer cells. To describe how abnormal the cancer cells and tissue are, the pathologist will assess the following three features: How much of the tumor tissue has normal breast ducts. The size and shape of the nuclei in the tumor cells. How many dividing cells are present, which is a measure of how fast the tumor cells are growing and dividing. For each feature, the pathologist assigns a score of 1 to 3; a score of “1” means the cells and tumor tissue look the most like normal cells and tissue, and a score of “3” means the cells and tissue look the most abnormal. The scores for each feature are added together to get a total score between 3 and 9. Three grades are possible: Total score of 3 to 5: G1 (Low grade or well differentiated). Total score of 6 to 7: G2 (Intermediate grade or moderately differentiated). Total score of 8 to 9: G3 (High grade or poorly differentiated). Healthy breast cells, and some breast cancer cells, have receptors (biomarkers) that attach to the hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormones are needed for healthy cells, and some breast cancer cells, to grow and divide. To check for these biomarkers, samples of tissue containing breast cancer cells are removed during a biopsy or surgery. The samples are tested in a laboratory to see whether the breast cancer cells have estrogen or progesterone receptors. Another type of receptor (biomarker) that is found on the surface of all breast cancer cells is called HER2. HER2 receptors are needed for the breast cancer cells to grow and divide. For breast cancer, biomarker testing includes the following: Estrogen receptor (ER). If the breast cancer cells have estrogen receptors, the cancer cells are called ER positive (ER+). If the breast cancer cells do not have estrogen receptors, the cancer cells are called ER negative (ER-). Progesterone receptor (PR). If the breast cancer cells have progesterone receptors, the cancer cells are called PR positive (PR+). If the breast cancer cells do not have progesterone receptors, the cancer cells are called PR negative (PR-). Human epidermal growth factor type 2 receptor (HER2/neu or HER2). If the breast cancer cells have larger than normal amounts of HER2 receptors on their surface, the cancer cells are called HER2 positive (HER2+). If the breast cancer cells have a normal amount of HER2 on their surface, the cancer cells are called HER2 negative (HER2-). HER2+ breast cancer is more likely to grow and divide faster than HER2- breast cancer. Sometimes the breast cancer cells will be described as triple negative or triple positive. Triple negative. If the breast cancer cells do not have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or a larger than normal amount of HER2 receptors, the cancer cells are called triple negative. Triple positive. If the breast cancer cells do have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and a larger than normal amount of HER2 receptors, the cancer cells are called triple positive. It is important to know the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 receptor status to choose the best treatment. There are drugs that can stop the receptors from attaching to the hormones estrogen and progesterone and stop the cancer from growing. Other drugs may be used to block the HER2 receptors on the surface of the breast cancer cells and stop the cancer from growing. Here are 3 examples that combine the TNM system, the grading system, and the biomarker status to find out the Pathological Prognostic breast cancer stage for a woman whose first treatment was surgery: If the tumor size is 30 millimeters (T2), has not spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0), has not spread to distant parts of the body (M0), and is: Grade 1 HER2+ ER- PR- The cancer is stage IIA. If the tumor size is 53 millimeters (T3), has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes (N2), has not spread to other parts of the body (M0), and is: Grade 2 HER2+ ER+ PR- The tumor is stage IIIA. If the tumor size is 65 millimeters (T3), has spread to 3 axillary lymph nodes (N1a), has spread to the lungs (M1), and is: Grade 1 HER2+ ER- PR- The cancer is stage IV (metastatic breast cancer). After surgery, your doctor will receive a pathology report that describes the size and location of the primary tumor, the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes, tumor grade, and whether certain biomarkers are present. The pathology report and other test results are used to determine your breast cancer stage. You are likely to have many questions. Ask your doctor to explain how staging is used to decide the best options to treat your cancer and whether there are clinical trials that might be right for you. For treatment options for stage I, stage II, stage IIIA, and operable stage IIIC breast cancer, see Treatment of Early/Localized/Operable Male Breast Cancer. For treatment options for cancer that has recurred (come back) near the area where it first formed, see Treatment of Locoregional Recurrent Male Breast Cancer. For treatment options for stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer or breast cancer that has recurred in other parts of the body, see Treatment of Metastatic Male Breast Cancer. In inflammatory breast
		cancer, cancer has spread to the skin of the breast and the breast looks red and swollen and feels warm. The
		redness and warmth occur because the cancer cells block the lymph vessels in the skin. The skin of the breast
		may also show the dimpled appearance called peau
		d’orange (like the skin of an orange). There may not be any lumps in the breast that can be felt. Inflammatory breast cancer may be stage IIIB, stage IIIC, or stage IV. There are different types of treatment for men with breast cancer. Five types of standard treatment are used to treat men with
		  breast cancer:SurgeryChemotherapy Hormone therapy Radiation therapyTargeted therapy Treatment for male breast cancer may cause side effects. Surgery Chemotherapy Hormone therapy Radiation therapy Targeted therapy Different types of treatment are available for men with breast
		  cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some
		  are being tested in clinical trials.      
		   A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help
		  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients
		  with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the
		  standard treatment, the new
		  treatment may become the standard treatment. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.
		  Information about clinical trials is available from the
		  NCI website. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a
		  decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team. Surgery for men with breast
			 cancer is usually a modified radical
			 mastectomy, surgery to remove the whole breast that has cancer. This may include removal of the nipple, areola (the dark-colored skin around the nipple), and skin over the breast. Most of the lymph nodes under the arm are also removed. Breast-conserving
			 surgery, an operation to remove the cancer but not the breast
			 itself, is also used for some men with breast cancer. A lumpectomy is done to remove the tumor (lump) and a small amount of normal tissue around it. Radiation therapy is given after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.EnlargeBreast-conserving surgery. The tumor and some normal tissue around it are removed, but not the breast itself. Some lymph nodes under the arm may be removed. Part of the chest wall lining may also be removed if the cancer is near it. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information. Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working. Hormone therapy with tamoxifen is often given to patients with estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor positive breast cancer and to patients with metastatic breast cancer (cancer
			 that has spread to other parts of the body). Hormone therapy with an aromatase inhibitor is given to some men who have metastatic breast cancer.  Aromatase inhibitors decrease the body's estrogen by blocking an enzyme called aromatase from turning androgen into estrogen. Anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane are types of aromatase inhibitors. Hormone therapy with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist is given to some men who have metastatic breast cancer.  LHRH agonists affect the pituitary gland, which controls how much testosterone is made by the testicles. In men who are taking LHRH agonists, the pituitary gland tells the testicles to make less testosterone. Leuprolide and goserelin are types of LHRH agonists. Other types of hormone therapy include megestrol acetate or anti-estrogen therapy, such as fulvestrant. See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information. Radiation therapy  is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.  Monoclonal antibody therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are types of targeted therapies used to treat men with breast cancer. Monoclonal antibodies are immune system proteins made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these antibodies can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Types of monoclonal antibody therapy include the following: Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the effects of the growth factor protein HER2. Pertuzumab  is a monoclonal antibody that may be combined with trastuzumab and chemotherapy to  treat  breast cancer. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine    is a monoclonal antibody linked to an  anticancer drug. This is called an antibody-drug conjugate. It may be used to treat men with hormone receptor positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs  that block signals needed for tumors   to grow. Lapatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that may be used to treat men with metastatic breast cancer. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that block proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases, which cause the growth of cancer cells. Palbociclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor used to treat men with metastatic breast cancer. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors block a protein called mTOR, which may keep cancer cells from growing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information. For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, visit our Side Effects page. Initial Surgery Adjuvant Therapy For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section. Treatment of early, localized, or operable breast cancer may include the following: Initial surgery. Adjuvant therapy. Treatment for men diagnosed with breast cancer is usually modified radical
		  mastectomy. Breast-conserving surgery with lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy may be used for some men. Therapy given after an operation when cancer
cells can no longer be seen is
		  called adjuvant
		  therapy. Even if the doctor removes all the
		  cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, the patient may be given
		  radiation therapy,
		  chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and/or targeted therapy  after surgery, to try
		  to kill any cancer cells that may be left. Node-negative: For
			 men whose cancer is node-negative (cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes),
			 adjuvant therapy should be considered on the same basis as for a woman with
			 breast cancer because there is no evidence that response to therapy is
			 different for men and women. Node-positive:
			 For men whose cancer is node-positive (cancer has spread to the lymph nodes),
			 adjuvant therapy may include the following: 
			 Chemotherapy.Hormone therapy with tamoxifen (to block the effect of estrogen) or less often, aromatase inhibitors (to reduce the amount of estrogen in the body).Targeted therapy with a  monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab or pertuzumab). Chemotherapy. Hormone therapy with tamoxifen (to block the effect of estrogen) or less often, aromatase inhibitors (to reduce the amount of estrogen in the body). Targeted therapy with a  monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab or pertuzumab). These treatments appear to increase survival in men as they do in
		  women. The patient’s response to hormone therapy depends on whether there are
		  hormone receptors (proteins) in the tumor. Most breast cancers in men have these
		  receptors. Hormone therapy is usually recommended for male breast cancer
		  patients, but it can have many side effects, including hot flashes and
		  impotence (the inability to have an erection adequate for sexual
		  intercourse). For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section. For men with locally recurrent disease (cancer that has come back in a
		limited area after treatment), treatment options include: Surgery. Radiation
		  therapy combined with
		  chemotherapy. Hormone therapy Targeted therapy Chemotherapy Surgery Radiation therapy Other treatment options For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section. Treatment options for metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body) may include the following: In men who have just been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that is  hormone receptor positive or if the hormone receptor status is not known, treatment 
may include: Tamoxifen therapy. Aromatase inhibitor therapy (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane) with or without an LHRH agonist. Sometimes cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor therapy (palbociclib) is also given. In men whose tumors are hormone receptor positive or hormone receptor unknown, with spread to the bone or soft tissue only, and who have been treated with tamoxifen, treatment may include: Aromatase inhibitor therapy with or without LHRH agonist. Other hormone therapy such as megestrol acetate, estrogen or androgen therapy, or anti-estrogen therapy such as fulvestrant. In men with  metastatic breast cancer that is  hormone receptor positive and has not responded to other treatments, options may include  targeted therapy such as: Trastuzumab, lapatinib, pertuzumab, or mTOR inhibitors. Antibody-drug conjugate therapy with ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor therapy (palbociclib) combined with letrozole. In men with metastatic breast cancer that is HER2/neu positive, treatment may include: Targeted therapy such as trastuzumab, pertuzumab,  ado-trastuzumab emtansine, or lapatinib. In men with metastatic breast cancer that is hormone receptor negative, has not responded to hormone therapy, has spread to other organs or has caused symptoms, treatment may include: Chemotherapy with one or more drugs. Total mastectomy for men with open or painful breast lesions.  Radiation therapy may be given after surgery. Surgery to remove cancer that has spread to the brain or spine. Radiation therapy may be given after surgery. Surgery to remove cancer that has spread to the lung. Surgery to repair or help support weak or broken bones. Radiation therapy may be given after surgery. Surgery to remove fluid that has collected around the lungs or heart. Radiation therapy to the bones, brain, spinal cord, breast, or chest wall to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. Strontium-89 (a radionuclide) to relieve pain from cancer that has spread to bones throughout the body. Other treatment options for metastatic breast cancer include: Drug therapy with bisphosphonates or  denosumab  to reduce bone disease and pain when cancer has spread to the bone. (See the PDQ summary on Cancer Pain for more information about bisphosphonates.) Clinical trials
		  testing new anticancer drugs, new drug combinations, and new ways of giving
		  treatment.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish. PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of male breast cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board. A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

At monthly meetings, it addresses the design, prioritization, and evaluation of concepts for phase 2 and phase 3 treatment trials in adult breast cancer. View the BCSC member roster. Strategic Priorities BCSC Strategic Priorities were formulated with the goal that the majority of submitted concepts would align with these established priorities. They address areas of unmet clinical need, important unanswered clinical questions, and potential new approaches to disease treatment.  Breast Immuno-Oncology (BIO) Task Force The BIO Task Force was established to provide early input into concepts for studies that define the role of immunotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer patients, prior to review by the BCSC. View the BIO Task Force member roster.  Breast Oncology Local Disease (BOLD) Task Force BOLD was established to provide early input into concepts for studies of localized breast cancer treated with surgery or radiation therapy prior to review by the BCSC. One of BOLD’s projects was to develop case report forms specifically for localized breast cancer trials. View the BOLD Task Force member roster. If you need help accessing the case report forms, view our step-by-step instructions.  CTPMs are held periodically and focus on specific clinical trial related topics. The following are important BCSC CTPMs: Identification and Treatment of Patients at Risk for Late Recurrence of ER+ Breast Cancer  
	Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer patients, especially those with nodal involvement, face a significant risk of late recurrence and associated poor clinical outcomes. More than half of recurrences occur beyond five years after diagnosis. Although treatment with chemotherapy and adjuvant endocrine therapy may have some benefit, they provide a minimal reduction in absolute risk and cause side effects that impact patient quality of life. This 1.5-day CTPM held in May 2019 laid the framework for the development of a clinical trial to test an intervention for patients at high risk of late recurrence of ER+ breast cancer. Read the executive summary.  Omitting Surgery in Patients with Complete Clinical/Radiologic Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Paradigm Shift  
	Certain subtypes of breast cancer patients (triple-negative and HER2 positive) have high rates of pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy (43-67%). Patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy who achieve a pathologic complete response have a very low rate of local recurrence and excellent overall survival, leading to an interest in the concept of eliminating surgery in these patients. Prior studies have suggested that it may be feasible to omit surgery but were not performed using current systemic therapy regimens or imaging techniques. Current and prior data set the stage for a trial that will definitively determine whether it is safe to omit surgery in patients that are predicted to have a high probability of pCR. The goal of this 1.5-day CTPM in October 2017 was to develop design recommendations for a clinical trial to determine if surgery can be omitted for a subset of breast cancer patients who have a complete clinical/radiologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Read the executive summary.  Life Style Intervention for Improving Disease-Free Survival in Early Stage Invasive Breast Cancer
	Several small studies suggested that a lifestyle intervention including exercise and weight loss might improve disease-free survival in women with invasive breast cancer. To address this topic in detail, in February 2014, a 1.5-day meeting resulted in the development of a trial, the Breast Cancer WEight Loss Study (BWEL Study), which is currently enrolling patients. Read the executive summary. Learn more about the study.  Next Generation Trials for Estrogen Receptor (ER) Positive Breast Cancer
	Although estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer has a relatively good 5-year prognosis, patients continue to relapse over time, making ER-positive breast cancer the majority of breast cancer deaths and thus in need of new clinical trials. The goals of the meeting were to address strategies to improve outcomes from clinical trials of any class of treatment in any stage of ER-positive breast cancer with a scientific focus on overcoming mechanisms of resistance to hormonal therapy. The May 2012 CTPM developed common definitions/clinical classification for endocrine resistance considering early stage and metastatic disease. It also concluded that standardized guidance on biopsies (compulsory and non-compulsory) and specimen storage is needed. Read the executive summary.  Next Generation Trials for HER2 Positive Breast Cancer
	HER2-positive breast cancers, about 15 - 20% of breast cancers, are generally more aggressive, respond less to hormone therapy, and are more prone to recurrence. This May 2011 CTPM addressed which agent(s) should be tested in the next generation of phase II and III clinical trials and the need to develop a more complete understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to HER2-directed therapies.

scratch, subjectively quantified by intensity, severity, location, and intractability.  It may be proposed that itch is akin to pain because both sensations are thought to be transmitted from skin to central nervous system (CNS) through nociceptive small-caliber C nerve fibers.[1] The perception of pruritus, much like the perception of pain, is greatly altered by psychological and CNS factors, thereby accounting for the great subjective variability between individuals in perceived pruritus from the same pruritogen.  Because of the
subjective nature of pruritus, the lack of a precise definition, and only recent development of a suitable murine model, pruritus is a disorder that has not been researched
adequately.[2] For the purpose of this discussion, a focus will be placed on pruritus in the absence of a primary dermatosis, as is often encountered in patients receiving cancer treatment.  However, there may still be significant secondary skin change noted in the form of lichen simplex chronicus, prurigo nodules, linear excoriations, linear petechiae, or superficial erosions in places the patient can reach to scratch (either with fingernails, back scratchers, or makeshift tools). It is estimated that pruritus is a manifestation of an underlying systemic disease in approximately 10% to 25% of affected individuals.[3]  In a single-institution retrospective review, patients seeking care for pruritus were more likely to have a concomitant diagnosis of cancer than were patients without pruritus (odds ratio [OR], 5.76; 95% confidence interval, 5.53–6.00). The OR for malignancy was higher in White patients than in African American patients.[4] Nondermatologic conditions that can lead to generalized pruritus include the following:[3] Hepatic, renal, or thyroid dysfunction. Malignancies: lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and cancers of the liver, gallbladder, biliary tract, and skin.[4] Myeloproliferative neoplasms (e.g., polycythemia vera). HIV or parasitic infections. Neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite the wide array of diseases that may present with pruritus, a systematic evaluation of the differential using a good history, review of systems, and appropriate blood work will lead to a rational and finite group of etiologies. Then correction of the underlying cause (if possible) and treatment of the pruritus with currently available therapies may ensue. In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed.  The evidence and application to practice related to children may differ significantly from information related to adults.  When specific information about the care of children is available, it is summarized under its own heading. Schmelz M: A neural pathway for itch.

J Am Acad Dermatol 80 (4): 931-937, 2019. [PUBMED Abstract] When a primary dermatitis is present, the differential may be narrowed by the history and physical findings, such as: Stigmata of atopic dermatitis. Psoriasis. Scabies. Allergic contact dermatitis. Primary cutaneous lymphoma. Biopsy of skin dermatitis may be extraordinarily helpful in this scenario if the etiology is not readily evident from history and physical exam alone.  In contrast, Table 1 provides a list of differential diagnoses for when there is little or no primary dermatitis identifiable.  Where available, the incidence of pruritus in that condition is given. As evident from the differential, a solid history and physical are essential for sorting through the possibilities.  To corroborate the clinical impression, a limited number of laboratory and radiological examinations also may be used to rule in or rule out many of the possibilities.  For more information, see the Assessment section. Hypothesized mechanisms of pruritus have been inferred from studies of pain because pain and itching share common molecular and neurophysiological
mechanisms.[9]  Both itch and pain sensations result from the activation of a
network of free nerve endings at the dermal-epidermal junction.  Activation may
be the result of internal or external thermal, mechanical, chemical, or
electrical stimulation.  The cutaneous nerve stimulation is activated or
mediated by several substances, including the following: Histamine. Vasoactive peptides. Enkephalins. Substance P (a tachykinin that affects smooth muscle). Prostaglandins. Interleukins (IL-4, IL-13, IL-31).[10] It is believed that nonanatomic factors (such as psychological
stress, tolerance, and presence and intensity of other sensations and/or
distractions) determine itch sensitivity in different regions of the body. The itch impulse is transmitted along the same neural pathway as pain impulses,
i.e., traveling from peripheral nerves to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord,
across the cord via the anterior commissure, and ascending along the
spinothalamic tract to the laminar nuclei of the contralateral thalamus. 
Thalamocortical tracts of tertiary neurons are believed to relay the impulse
through the integrating reticular activating system of the thalamus to several
areas of the cerebral cortex.  Factors that are believed to enhance the
sensation of itch include:[9,11-13] Dryness of the epidermis and dermis. Anoxia of
tissues. Dilation of the capillaries. Irritating stimuli. Psychological
responses. The motor response of scratching follows the perception of itch.  Scratching is
modulated at the corticothalamic center and is a spinal reflex.  Itching may be relieved for 15 to 25 minutes after scratching.  The mechanism
through which the itch is relieved by scratching is unknown.  It is
hypothesized that scratching generates sensory impulses that break circuits
in the relay areas of the spinal cord.  Scratching may actually enhance the
sensation of itching, creating a characteristic itch-scratch-itch cycle.  Other
physical stimuli such as vibration, heat, cold, and ultraviolet radiation
diminish itching and increase the release of proteolytic enzymes, potentially
eliciting the itch-scratch-itch cycle. A pinprick near or in the same dermatome as an itchy point will abolish the
itch sensation.[12]  It is known that hard scratching may substitute pain for
the itch, and in some instances, the patient might find pain the more tolerable
sensation.  It is thought that spinal modulation of afferent stimuli (Gate
theory) and central mechanisms may play a role in the relief of itch.[12] Hypothesized pathogenesis of pruritus associated with underlying disease states
are varied.  Biliary, hepatic, renal, and malignant diseases are thought to
produce pruritus through circulating toxic substances.  Histamine released from
circulating basophils and the release of leukopeptidase from white blood cells
may trigger pruritus associated with lymphomas and leukemias.  Elevated blood
levels of kininogen in Hodgkin lymphoma, the release of histamine or bradykinin
precursors from solid tumors, and the release of serotonin in carcinoids may all be
related to pruritus.[11,14] People receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or biologic response
modifiers for the treatment of malignancy are likely to experience pruritus.  This
same population is quite likely to be exposed to many of the other etiologic
factors relating to pruritus, ranging from nutrition-related xerosis (dry
skin) to radiation desquamation, chemotherapy-induced and biologic agent–induced side
effects, antibiotic reactions, and other drug sensitivities. Because many of these therapies lead to decreased cell turnover, skin can become thin, atrophic, and dehydrated.  Long-term xerosis may also occur with poor recovery of sweat, sebaceous, and apocrine gland function after a course of cytotoxic therapy.

Generalized pruritus should be investigated because of its strong medical significance, as outlined above, particularly if it is interfering with daily activities or sleep, and/or is intractable. For more information, see the Etiology/Pathophysiology section. Assessment of pruritus must incorporate an accurate and thorough history and
physical examination.[1] A history includes the following data: Location, onset, duration, and intensity of itching. Effect on activities of daily living or sleep. Factors that relieve and aggravate itching. Other family members or pets affected. History of pruritus. History of malignant disease. Current malignant disease and treatment. Nonmalignant systemic diseases. Use of medications (analgesics, antibiotics, and other prescription and nonprescription drugs, including illicit drugs). Nutritional and fluid level status. Social history (hobbies, occupation, sexual history, and travel). Current skin care practices. Patient’s emotional state. A physical examination will provide data from an assessment of the following: All skin surfaces for signs of infection. All skin surfaces for signs of primary dermatitis (e.g., drug reaction, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, connective tissue disease, and lichen planus). All skin surfaces for signs of secondary dermatitis (e.g., macular erythema, dryness, excoriation, linear petechiae, prurigo nodules, and lichen simplex chronicus). Environmental factors (temperature, humidity). Physical factors (tight, constrictive clothing). Skin turgor, texture, color, temperature, and cutaneous neoplasms. First-line studies should include the following: Complete blood count with differential and platelet count. Renal function (blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine). Hepatic function (transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin). Lactate dehydrogenase. Thyroid function (thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxin levels). Chest x-ray. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Second-line laboratory studies guided by a review of systems and a physical exam may include the following: Skin biopsy (routine histology with and without direct immunofluorescence). HIV screening. Serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin. Fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1C. Parathyroid function (calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone levels). Viral hepatitis screening. Serum immunoglobulin E levels. Serum protein electrophoresis/serum immunofixation electrophoresis. Tissue transglutaminase and endomysial antibodies. Serum tryptase, histamine, and/or chromogranin-A levels. Urine for sediment; 24-hour urine collection for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (serotonin metabolite) and methylimidazoleacetic acid (histamine metabolite). Stool for occult blood, ova, and parasite.

For more information, see Levels of Evidence. If an underlying cause of pruritus is identified, treatment of the primary disease or correction of the underlying abnormality is primary therapy, when feasible. For example, iron supplementation in the setting of iron-deficiency anemia or thyroid supplementation for hypothyroidism should be initiated first. However, gentle skin techniques as outlined below are indicated, even if they are not expected to completely alleviate the symptoms—they should be considered helpful adjuvant therapies. Interventions for pruritus can be categorized into four distinct groups: Prevention and elimination of provocative factors. Topical therapies. Systemic therapies. Physical modalities. Patients and caregivers must be included in planning and providing care to
the extent possible.  Education is an important aspect of symptom control. 
Skin care regimens incorporate protection from the environment, good cleansing practices, and internal and
external hydration.[1][Level of evidence: IV]  The intensity of the regimen and the techniques
employed will vary according to etiologic factors and the degree of distress
associated with the pruritus. Adequate nutrition is essential to the maintenance of healthy skin.  An optimal
diet should include a balance of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins,
minerals, and fluids.  Daily fluid intake of at least 3,000 mL is
suggested as a guideline but may not be possible for some individuals.[2,3] Aggravating factors should be avoided, including the following: Fluid loss secondary to fever, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, or decreased
fluid intake. Bathing with hot water. Using bubble baths or soaps that contain detergents. Bathing more than once a day or bathing for longer than 30 minutes. Using soap and adding oil early in a bath. Using a reusable fomite for scrubbing (e.g., buff-puff or loofah sponge). Using scents, fragrances, and perfumes. Dry environment. Laundering sheets and clothing with detergent containing scents, dyes, and preservatives. Using fabric softener sheets. Wearing tight restrictive clothing or clothing made of wool, synthetics, or other
harsh/scratchy fabric. Using underarm deodorants or antiperspirants. Applying topical preparations containing scents, dyes, or preservatives. Emotional stress. Alleviating factors should be promoted, as follows: Applying unscented emollient creams or ointments. Bathing in tepid water. Using mild skin cleansers (non-soap) or soaps made for sensitive skin (e.g., Cetaphil cleanser, Dove for Sensitive Skin, Oilatum, Basis). Using soap only for dirty areas; otherwise, water is sufficient. Limiting bathing to 30 minutes daily or every other day. Adding oil and using soap at the end of a bath or adding a colloidal oatmeal treatment     
early to the bath. Gently washing, if needed, with a clean, fresh, soft cotton washcloth. Rinsing all residue from bathing with fresh tepid water. Drying off by patting skin instead of rubbing. Maintaining a humid environment (e.g., using a humidifier). Using cotton flannel blankets, if needed. Washing sheets, clothing, and undergarments in mild soaps for infant         
clothing containing no scents, dyes, or preservatives (e.g., Dreft, All Free Clear, Tide Free and Gentle). Using liquid fabric softener that is rinsed out in the wash (e.g., All Free Clear Fabric Softener) or avoiding fabric softener altogether. Wearing loose-fitting clothing and clothing made of cotton or other soft
fabrics. Using distraction, relaxation, positive imagery, or cutaneous stimulation. Heat increases cutaneous blood flow and may enhance itching.  Heat also lowers
humidity, and skin loses moisture when the relative humidity falls below 40%.
A cool, humid environment may reverse these processes.
Extensive bathing aggravates dry skin, and hot baths exacerbate fluid loss by causing vasodilation. The vasodilation results in increased blood flow, which   enhances itching. Tepid baths have an antipruritic effect, possibly resulting from capillary vasoconstriction. The goal of skin cleansing is to remove dirt and prevent odor, but actual
hygienic practices are influenced by skin type, lifestyle, and culture. 
Bathing should be limited to 30 minutes every day or every 2 days. Many soaps are salts of fatty acids with an alkali
base,  leading to excessive defatting of the skin lipids and altered skin pH, thus irritating the skin. Older adults or individuals with dry skin should limit the use of soaps to areas with apocrine glands. Plain water should suffice for cleaning other skin surfaces. Mild soaps have less soap or detergent content. Soap is a degreaser and can also irritate skin.  Superfatted soaps deposit a film of
oil on the skin surface, but there is no proof that they are less drying than
other soaps, and they may be more expensive. Residue left by detergents after bathing or used in laundering clothes and linens, as well as fabric softeners and antistatic products, may aggravate pruritus. Clothing detergent residue can be neutralized by the addition of vinegar (1 teaspoon per quart of water) to rinse water. Mild laundry soaps marketed for infant items also may offer a solution. Loose-fitting, lightweight cotton clothes and cotton bed sheets are suggested.
The elimination of heavy bedcovers may alleviate itching by decreasing body
heat.  Wool and some synthetic fabrics may be irritating.  Distraction, music
therapy, relaxation, and imagery may be useful to relieve symptoms.[4] Some topical agents—including cornstarch, talcum powder, perfumed powders, and bubble baths—can irritate the skin and cause pruritus.  Cornstarch has been
an acceptable intervention for pruritus associated with dry desquamation
related to radiation therapy; however, it should not  be applied to moist skin surfaces,
areas with hair, sebaceous glands, skin folds (intertriginous zones), or areas close to mucosal
surfaces, such as the vagina and rectum.[5,6]  Glucose is formed when
cornstarch is moistened, providing an excellent medium for fungal growth.[6] Agents with metal ions (i.e., talcum and aluminum used in antiperspirants)
enhance skin reactions during external-beam radiation therapy and should be
avoided throughout the course of radiation therapy.  Talcum-based agents are otherwise preferred over cornstarch-based modalities when needed, particularly for intertriginous zones. Other common ingredients
in over-the-counter lotions and creams that may enhance skin reactions include
alcohol, topical antibiotics, and topical anesthetics. If pruritus is thought to be primarily related to dry skin, interventions to
improve skin hydration can be employed.  The main source of hydration for skin
is moisture from the vasculature of underlying tissues.  Water, not lipid,
regulates the pliability of the epidermis, providing the rationale for using
emollients.[7]  Emollients reduce evaporation by forming occlusive and
semi-occlusive films over the skin surface, encouraging the production of
moisture in the layer of epidermis beneath the film (hence the term
moisturizer).[8][Level of evidence: IV] Knowledge about the ingredients in skin care products is essential because many
ingredients may enhance skin reactions.  The three main ingredients of emollients
are as follows: Petrolatum, which is poorly absorbed by irradiated skin and is not easily removed.  A
thick layer could produce an undesired bolus effect when applied within a
radiation treatment field.[9][Level of evidence: IV] Lanolin, which may cause allergic sensitization in some individuals.[8][Level of evidence: IV] Mineral oil, which is used in combination with
petrolatum and lanolin to create creams and lotions and may be an active
ingredient in bath oils. Other ingredients added to these products—such as
thickeners, opacifiers, preservatives, fragrances, and colorings—may cause
allergic skin reactions. Product selection and recommendations must be made in consideration of each
patient’s unique needs and should incorporate variables such as the following:[1][Level of evidence: IV] Individual’s skin. Desired effect. Consistency and texture of the
preparation. Cost and acceptability to the patient. Emollient creams
or lotions should be applied at least two or three times daily and after
bathing.  Gels with a local anesthetic (0.5%–5% lidocaine) can be used on some small areas (with the caveat that gels are composed of mostly alcohol-based vehicles), as often as every 2 hours if necessary.[10][Level of evidence: IV] Over-the-counter products containing menthol, camphor, pramoxine, or capsaicin can be used for certain areas of worst pruritus.  These substances soothe, cool, or inhibit itch sensations, thereby raising the threshold for itch perception. Capsaicin-based therapies are more likely to be beneficial in pruritus of neuropathic origin.[11] If significant skin breakdown from scratching has occurred or there is evidence of impetiginization, the use of dilute bleach baths, as is done for patients with atopic dermatitis, may be helpful.  A half-cup of plain unscented sodium hypochlorite (bleach) is added to half a tub of tap water for soaking at the beginning of the bath period.  If sponge bathing is required, this is equivalent to approximately 5 mL of bleach to 1 gal of water. Topical steroids can reduce itching, but they reduce blood flow
to the skin, resulting in thinning of the skin and increased susceptibility to
injury.[12][Level of evidence: IV]
Topical steroids should therefore be reserved for pruritic skin with associated primary dermatitis or inflammatory etiologies.  Some practitioners may formulate their own mixture of dilute steroid-containing moisturizer to serve this purpose by compounding menthol 0.5% and fluocinonide 0.0125% into a Vanicream base (fluocinonide 0.05% 60 g, menthol 480 mg, and Vanicream QSAD 240 g).  Topical steroids should not be applied to skin surfaces inside a radiation field during treatment but may be used successfully for radiation-induced dermatitis after the treatment course has concluded. For more-severe xerosis or keratoderma, humectants may be indicated.  These not only provide an occlusive or semi-occlusive barrier for water, but also chemically exfoliate an excessively cornified layer while drawing dermal fluid into the epidermal compartment.  Choices include: [13][Level of evidence: IV] Salicylic acid 6% cream. Ammonium lactate 12% cream. Creams and ointments containing urea 10% to 50%. Humectants can significantly improve skin pliability and reduce fissuring, but care must be taken that they do not get into fissures because they can cause stinging sensations on open erosions. Systemic medications useful in the management of pruritus include those directed toward the underlying disease or control of symptoms. Antibiotics can reduce symptoms associated with infection. Oral antihistamines may provide symptomatic relief in histamine-related itching; however, they are not considered useful in pruritus of neuropathic origin. It is believed that the sedative effect of antihistamines adds to their antipruritic efficacy; therefore, a higher dose of antihistamine at bedtime may produce desirable potentiation of the antipruritic effect by also providing this sedative effect. If one antihistamine is ineffective, one from another class may provide relief (see Table 2). Second-generation antihistamines have several advantages over first-generation antihistamines.[14] Decreased activity on nonhistamine receptors results in fewer adverse effects.  Second-generation antihistamines dissociate slowly from histamine receptors, allowing for once-daily dosing.  Compared with first-generation antihistamines, second-generation antihistamines produce less central nervous system penetration and therefore less sedation.  Given these advantages, using doses of levocetirizine and desloratadine higher than those approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been suggested to provide relief for some patients with chronic urticarial conditions.[15] However, studies have produced conflicting results with cetirizine.[16,17] Several alternative medications can be used to alleviate pruritus (see Table 3). Antidepressants can have strong antihistamine and antipruritic effects.[22][Level of evidence: IV]   Tricyclic antidepressants such as doxepin, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and trimipramine have additional antihistaminic effects, making them of additional benefit in dermatological conditions such as urticaria. However, the generally more-favorable side-effect profile of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors has made them the first-line agents in the management of psychogenic pruritus.[26][Level of evidence: II] Aspirin seems to have reduced pruritus in some individuals with polycythemia vera, while increasing
pruritus in others.  Thrombocytopenic cancer patients should be cautioned
against using aspirin.  Cimetidine alone or in combination with aspirin has
been used with some effectiveness for pruritus associated with Hodgkin lymphoma and polycythemia vera.[27][Level of evidence: III] Novel agents that may be tried in recalcitrant cases of pruritus include gabapentin, pregabalin, and botulinum toxin injection, particularly for neurogenic itch such as post-herpetic neuralgia.[28,29] Aprepitant has been used successfully in the treatment of pruritus by blocking the neurokinin-1 receptor (NKR-1), which is activated by substance P.[30][Level of evidence: III] Sequestrant agents may be effective in relieving pruritus associated with renal
or hepatic disease through binding and removing pruritogenic substances in the
gut and reducing bile salt concentration. Choices include ursodeoxycholic acid and cholestyramine; however, cholestyramine is not always effective and produces gastric side effects.[47] Because of the association of pruritus with opioid receptor agonism, increased catabolism of endogenous opioids using rifampin in uremia may be beneficial.[48]  Opioid antagonists such as naloxone, naltrexone, nalmefene, butorphanol, and nalbuphine may also have some benefit, particularly in patients with uremic pruritus.[26,40][Level of evidence: III] Alternatives to scratching for the relief of pruritus can help the patient
interrupt the itch-scratch-itch cycle.  Substituting the application of emollients for scratching may help reduce skin breakdown. The application of a cool washcloth or ice
over the site may be useful.  Firm pressure at the site of itching, at a site
contralateral to the site of itching, and at acupressure points may break the
neural pathway.  Rubbing, pressure, and vibration can be used to relieve
itching.[49][Level of evidence: IV]; [4] There are anecdotal reports of the use of transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulators (TENS) and acupuncture in the management of pruritus.[50]

related to uremia.[50] Detz W, Berman B: Aids that preserve hydration and mitigate its loss. Consultant  24: 46-62, 1984. Lydon J, Purl S, Goodman M: Integumentary and mucous membrane alterations.

Pheochromocytoma is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that grows from cells called chromaffin cells. These cells produce hormones needed for the body and are found in the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are small organs located in the upper region of the abdomen on top of the kidneys. About 80-85% of pheochromocytomas grow in the inner layer of the adrenal gland, called the adrenal medulla. About 15-20% of pheochromocytomas grow outside of this area and are called extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas. Most pheochromocytomas are benign, which means they are not cancer and do not spread to other parts of the body. Only about 10% of pheochromocytomas spread to other parts of the body. It is unknown how many people have pheochromocytoma because many people are never diagnosed. Most cases of pheochromocytoma occur in people aged 30 to 50 years old. One estimate suggests about only 8 people per 1 million people have pheochromocytoma, but this estimate may be low. Some people with pheochromocytoma have symptoms, but others don’t. Symptoms may occur as often as several times a day to a couple of times per month. Some people may feel intense symptoms that last for a short period of time, called “paroxysmal attacks”. These symptoms can include:
•    High blood pressure
•    Headaches
•    Irregular heartbeat
•    Sweating Lab Tests: If you have symptoms of pheochromocytoma, your doctor will order lab tests of your urine and blood to check your hormone levels. Imaging: Your doctor will use imaging scans such as CT, MRI, and PET to look at where the tumor is and how big it is. They will also check for signs that the tumor has spread to other parts of the body. Treatment of pheochromocytoma may involve many different doctors, including doctors who specialize in hormone disorders and doctors who diagnose and treat cancer. Treatment options to discuss with your doctor include: Medications: Your doctor may give you medications to control your symptoms, such as alpha blockers and beta blockers, which are drugs to control high blood pressure. Surgery: Surgery is used to remove as much of the tumor as possible. In some cases, the entire adrenal gland may be removed. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy: Radiation and chemotherapy treatments are used when pheochromocytoma has spread to other parts of the body. In some cases, pheochromocytoma can run in families. About 25-35% of cases of pheochromocytoma may be inherited. Some of these inherited cases may be associated with a genetic condition, such as Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Types 2a and 2b, Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome, and Neurofibromatosis. Scientists have found mutations in approximately 20 different genes that they think may lead to pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Mutations in the genes RET, VHL, NF1, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2, MDH2, IDH1, PHD1/PHD2, HIF2A/EPAS1/2, TMEM127, MAX, HRAS, MAML3 and CSDE1 may play a role in forming pheochromocytoma and paragangliomas. In many cases, it is not known what causes pheochromocytoma to form. If you have pheochromocytoma, you may have other genetic conditions that increased your chance of getting pheochromocytoma. These genetic conditions include:
•    Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 syndrome, types A and B (MEN2A and MEN2B)
•    Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome
•    Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)
•    Hereditary paraganglioma syndrome
•    Carney-Stratakis dyad (paraganglioma and gastrointestinal stromal tumor [GIST])
•    Carney triad (paraganglioma, GIST, and pulmonary chondroma) The estimate of how a disease will affect you long-term is called prognosis. Every person is different and prognosis will depend on many factors, such as: •    Where the tumor is in your body
•    If the cancer has spread to other parts of your body
•    How much of the tumor was taken out during surgery If you want information on your prognosis, it is important to talk to your doctor. Also, NCI has resources to help you understand cancer prognosis. Doctors estimate pheochromocytoma survival rates by how groups of people with pheochromocytoma have done in the past. Patients with a small pheochromocytoma that has not spread to other parts of the body have a five-year survival rate of about 95%. Patients with pheochromocytoma that has grown back (recurred) or spread to other parts of the body have a five-year survival rate between 34% and 60%.

		  the outer layer of the adrenal gland. Having certain genetic conditions increases the risk of adrenocortical carcinoma. Symptoms of adrenocortical carcinoma include pain in the abdomen. Imaging studies and tests that examine the blood and urine are used to diagnose adrenocortical carcinoma. Certain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. There are two  adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are small and shaped like a triangle. One adrenal gland sits on top of each kidney. Each adrenal gland has two parts. The outer layer of the adrenal gland is the adrenal cortex. The center of the adrenal gland is the adrenal medulla. EnlargeAnatomy of the adrenal gland. There are two adrenal glands, one on top of each kidney. The outer part of each gland is the adrenal cortex and the inner part is the adrenal medulla. The adrenal cortex makes important hormones that: Balance the water and salt in the body. Help keep blood pressure normal. Help control the body's use of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Cause the body to have masculine or feminine characteristics. Adrenocortical carcinoma  is also called cancer of the adrenal cortex.  A tumor of the adrenal cortex may be functioning (makes more hormones than normal) or nonfunctioning (does not make more hormones than normal). Most adrenocortical tumors are functioning. The hormones made by functioning tumors may cause certain signs or symptoms of disease. The adrenal medulla makes hormones that help the body react to stress. Cancer that forms in the adrenal medulla is called pheochromocytoma and is not discussed in this summary. For more information, see Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma. Adrenocortical carcinoma and pheochromocytoma can occur in both adults and children. Treatment for children, however, is different than treatment for adults. For more information, see Childhood Adrenocortical Carcinoma Treatment and Childhood Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma Treatment. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for adrenocortical carcinoma include having the following hereditary diseases: Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Carney complex. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by adrenocortical carcinoma: A lump in the abdomen. Pain the abdomen or back. A feeling of fullness in the abdomen. A nonfunctioning adrenocortical tumor may not cause signs or symptoms in the early stages. A functioning adrenocortical tumor makes too much of one of the following hormones: Cortisol. Aldosterone. Testosterone. Estrogen. Too much cortisol may cause: Weight gain in the face, neck, and trunk of the body and thin arms and legs. Growth of fine hair on the face, upper back, or arms. A round, red, full face. A lump of fat on the back of the neck. A deepening of the voice and swelling of the sex organs or breasts in both males and females. Muscle weakness. High blood sugar. High blood pressure. Too much aldosterone may cause: High blood pressure. Muscle weakness or cramps. Frequent urination. Feeling thirsty. Too much testosterone (in women) may cause: Growth of fine hair on the face, upper back, or arms. Acne. Balding. A deepening of the voice. No menstrual periods. Men who make too much testosterone do not usually have signs or symptoms. Too much estrogen (in women) may cause: Irregular menstrual periods in women who have not gone through menopause. Vaginal bleeding in women who have gone through menopause. Weight gain. Too much estrogen (in men) may cause: Growth of breast tissue. Lower sex drive. Impotence. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by adrenocortical carcinoma or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems. The tests and procedures used to diagnose adrenocortical carcinoma depend on the patient's signs and symptoms. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and health history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Twenty-four-hour urine test: A test in which urine is collected for 24 hours to measure the amounts of cortisol or 17-ketosteroids. A higher than normal amount of these in the urine may be a sign of disease in the adrenal cortex. Low-dose dexamethasone  suppression test: A test in which one or more small doses of dexamethasone are given. The level of cortisol is checked from a sample of blood or from urine that is collected for three days. This test is done to check if the adrenal gland is making too much cortisol. High-dose dexamethasone suppression test: A test in which one or more high doses of dexamethasone are given. The level of cortisol is checked from a sample of blood or from urine that is collected for three days. This test is done to check if the adrenal gland is making too much cortisol or if the pituitary gland is telling the adrenal glands to make too much cortisol. Blood chemistry study: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as potassium or sodium,  released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). An MRI of the abdomen is done to diagnose adrenocortical carcinoma. Adrenal angiography: A procedure to look at the arteries and the flow of blood near the adrenal glands.  A contrast dye is injected into the adrenal arteries.  As the dye moves through the arteries, a series of x-rays are taken to see if any arteries are blocked. Adrenal venography:  A procedure to look at the adrenal veins and the flow of blood near the adrenal glands.  A contrast dye is injected into an adrenal vein.  As the contrast dye moves through the veins, a series of x-rays are taken to see if any veins are blocked. A catheter (very thin tube) may be inserted into the vein to take a blood sample, which is checked for abnormal hormone levels. PET scan  (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. MIBG scan: A very small amount of radioactive material called MIBG is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. Adrenal gland cells take up the radioactive material and are detected by a device that measures radiation. This scan is done to tell the difference between adrenocortical carcinoma and pheochromocytoma. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The sample may be taken using a thin needle, called a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy or a wider needle, called a core biopsy. The prognosis and treatment options   depend on the following: The stage of the cancer (the size of the tumor and whether it is  in the adrenal gland only or has spread to other places in the body). Whether the tumor can be completely removed in surgery. Whether the cancer has been treated in the past. The patient's general health. The grade of tumor cells (how different they look from normal cells under a microscope). Adrenocortical carcinoma may be cured if treated at an early stage. After adrenocortical carcinoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the adrenal gland or to other parts of the body. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. The following stages are used for adrenocortical carcinoma:Stage IStage IIStage IIIStage IV Adrenocortical carcinoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated. Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the adrenal gland or to other
parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the
staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know
the stage in order to plan treatment. The following tests and
procedures may be used in the staging process: CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen or chest, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium: A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen. A substance called gadolinium may be injected into  a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the vena cava, and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. Adrenalectomy: A procedure to remove the affected adrenal gland.  A tissue sample is viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  adrenocortical carcinoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually adrenocortical carcinoma cells. The disease is metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma, not lung cancer. In stage I, the tumor is  5 centimeters or smaller and is found in the adrenal gland only. In stage II, the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters and is found in the adrenal gland only. In stage III, the tumor is any size and has spread: to nearby lymph nodes; or to nearby tissues or organs (kidney, diaphragm, pancreas, spleen, or liver) or to large blood vessels (renal vein or vena cava) and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. In stage IV,  the tumor is any size, may have spread to nearby lymph nodes, and has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lung, bone, or peritoneum. The cancer may come back in the adrenal cortex or in other parts of the body. There are different types of treatment for  patients with adrenocortical carcinoma. The following types of treatment are used:SurgeryRadiation therapyChemotherapy New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.  ImmunotherapyTargeted therapy Treatment for adrenocortical carcinoma may cause side effects. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Follow-up tests may be needed. Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Immunotherapy Targeted therapy Different types of treatments are available for  patients with adrenocortical carcinoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Surgery to remove the adrenal gland (adrenalectomy) is often used to treat adrenocortical carcinoma.  Sometimes surgery is done to remove the nearby lymph nodes and other tissue where the cancer has spread. Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.  There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. This summary section  describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.  It may not mention every new treatment being studied.  Information about  clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.  This cancer treatment is a type of biologic therapy. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, visit our Side Effects page. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. As you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or checkups. Some tests that were done to diagnose or stage the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish. PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of adult adrenocortical carcinoma.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board. A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website. For more information, call the Cancer Information Service (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237). PDQ is a registered trademark.

Research Advances   Causes & Risk Factors  Symptoms  Screening  Diagnosis  Prognosis & Survival Rates  Stages  Treatment  Childhood Bladder Cancer  Coping & Treatment Issues  Health Professional  Research Advances  Childhood bladder cancer is a very rare type of cancer that forms in the tissues of the bladder. The bladder is a hollow, balloon-shaped organ in the lower part of the abdomen that stores urine. The bladder has a muscular wall that allows it to get larger to store urine made by the kidneys, and to shrink to squeeze urine out of the body. There are two kidneys, one on each side of the backbone, above the waist. The bladder and kidneys work together to remove toxins and wastes from the body  through urine: Tiny tubules in the kidneys filter and clean the blood. These tubules take out waste products and make urine. The urine passes from each kidney through a long tube called a ureter into the bladder. The bladder holds the urine until it passes through the urethra and leaves the body. Urothelial carcinoma (also called transitional cell carcinoma) is cancer that begins in the urothelial cells, which line the urethra, bladder, ureters, renal pelvis, and some other organs. The cells of the urothelium are known as transitional cells because they are able to stretch when the bladder is full of urine and shrink when it is emptied. Urothelial carcinoma is the most common form of bladder cancer in children. Squamous cell and other more aggressive types of bladder cancer are less common in children.  Risk factors for childhood bladder cancer  Symptoms of childhood bladder cancer  Tests to diagnose childhood bladder cancer  Getting a second opinion  Prognosis of  childhood bladder cancer  Types of treatment for childhood bladder cancer  Treatment of childhood bladder cancer  Side effects of treatment  Follow-up testing  Coping and support  Bladder cancer is caused by certain changes to the way bladder cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. To learn more about how cancer develops, see What Is Cancer? The risk of bladder cancer is increased in children who have been treated for cancer with certain anticancer drugs, called alkylating agents, which include cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, and temozolomide. Survivors of heritable retinoblastoma also have an increased risk of developing bladder cancer. Not every child with these risk factors will get bladder cancer, and some children who get the disease don’t have any known risk factors. Talk with your child’s doctor if you’re concerned about your child’s risk. The symptoms of bladder cancer can vary from person to person. The most common symptom of bladder cancer is blood in the urine, called hematuria. It’s often slightly rusty to bright red in color. You may see blood in your child’s urine at one point, then not see it again for a while. Sometimes there are very small amounts of blood in the urine that can only be found by having a test done. Other common symptoms of bladder cancer can include frequent urination or feeling the need to urinate without being able to do so pain during urination abdominal or lower back pain It’s important to check with your child’s doctor if your child has any of these symptoms. Keep in mind that urinary tract infections, kidney or bladder stones, or other problems related to the kidney could also be the cause, not cancer. Your child’s doctor will ask you when the symptoms started and how often your child has been having them. They’ll most likely ask for a urine sample as a first step in diagnosing what is causing these symptoms. If your child has symptoms or lab test results that suggest bladder cancer, their doctor will need to find out if these are due to cancer or another condition. They may ask about your child’s personal and family medical history to learn more about your child’s symptoms and possible risk factors for bladder cancer do a physical exam to feel for signs of cancer ask for a sample of urine so it can be checked in the lab for blood, abnormal cells, or infection Depending on your child’s symptoms and medical history and the results of their physical exam and urine lab tests, the doctor may recommend more tests to find out if your child has bladder cancer, and if so, its extent (stage). The results of tests and procedures done to diagnose bladder cancer are used to help make decisions about treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used: CT scan is a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Learn more about Computed Tomography (CT) Scans and Cancer. An ultrasound exam is a procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the pelvis, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. Cystoscopy is a procedure in which the doctor looks inside the bladder and urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body) to check for abnormal areas. A cystoscope  is slowly inserted through the urethra into the bladder to allow the doctor to see inside. A cystoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove very small tumors or tissue samples for biopsy. If a cystoscopy is not done at diagnosis, tissue samples are removed and checked for cancer during surgery to remove all or part of the bladder. Some people may want to get a second opinion to confirm their child’s bladder cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. If you choose to seek a second opinion, you will need to get important medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans before giving a recommendation. The doctor who gives the second opinion may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another approach, or provide more information about your child’s tumor. To learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see Finding Cancer Care. You can contact NCI’s Cancer Information Service via chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor or hospital that can provide a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, see Questions to Ask Your Doctor about Cancer. If your child has been diagnosed with bladder cancer, you may have questions about how serious the cancer is and your child’s chances of survival. The likely outcome or course of a disease is called prognosis. The prognosis can be affected by whether the cancer can be removed by surgery.   In children, bladder cancer is usually low grade (not likely to spread) and the prognosis is usually excellent after surgery to remove the tumor. There are different types of treatment for children and adolescents with bladder cancer. You and your child’s cancer care team will work together to decide treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as your child’s overall health and whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has come back. A pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer, will oversee treatment. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health professionals who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. This may include the following specialists and others: pediatrician pediatric surgeon pediatric urologist pediatric nurse specialist rehabilitation specialist social worker psychologist fertility specialist Your child’s treatment plan will include information about the cancer, the goals of treatment, treatment options, and the possible side effects. It will be helpful to talk with your child’s cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect. For help every step of the way, see our downloadable booklet, Children with Cancer: A Guide for Parents. Surgery to remove the cancer and part or all of the bladder is the standard treatment for bladder cancer in children. The type of surgery depends on where the cancer is located and whether it is aggressive. Talk with your child’s doctor about how surgery for bladder cancer can affect urinating, sexual function, and fertility. To learn more, see Fertility Issues in Girls and Women with Cancer and Fertility Issues in Boys and Men with Cancer. During TUR, the doctor removes tissue from the bladder using a resectoscope inserted into the bladder through the urethra. A resectoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light, a lens for viewing, and a tool to remove tissue and burn away any remaining tumor cells. Tissue samples from the area where the tumor was removed are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. Cystectomy, surgery to remove part or all of the bladder, is rarely used to treat bladder cancer in children. However, it may be needed in children with squamous cell carcinoma or more aggressive carcinomas. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be an option. Use our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. To learn more about clinical trials, see Clinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Treatment of newly diagnosed bladder cancer in children is usually surgery: transurethral resection (TUR) surgery to remove the bladder (rare) Learn more about these treatments in the Types of treatment section. Sometimes bladder cancer can recur (come back) after treatment. If your child is diagnosed with recurrent bladder cancer, your child's doctor will work with you to  plan treatment. Learn more about Side Effects of Cancer Treatment. Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include physical problems changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory second cancers (new types of cancer) or other conditions Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments. Learn more about Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment worked. If the bladder cancer recurs (comes back) after treatment, it will usually be within 3 years from diagnosis. Your child will receive tests from time to time after surgery to find out if their condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred. These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. When a child has cancer, every member of the family needs support. Honest and calm conversations build trust as you talk with your child and their siblings. Taking care of yourself during this difficult time is also important. Reach out to your child’s treatment team and to people in your family and community for support. To learn more, see Support for Families When a Child Has Cancer.  Updated:

Do angiogenesis inhibitors have side effects? What is angiogenesis? Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels. This process involves the migration, growth, and differentiation of endothelial cells, which line the inside wall of blood vessels. The process of angiogenesis is controlled by chemical signals in the body. Some of these signals, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), bind to receptors on the surface of normal endothelial cells. When VEGF and other endothelial growth factors bind to their receptors on endothelial cells, signals within these cells are initiated that promote the growth and survival of new blood vessels. Other chemical signals, called angiogenesis inhibitors, interfere with blood vessel formation. Normally, the angiogenesis stimulating and inhibiting effects of these chemical signals are balanced so that blood vessels form only when and where they are needed, such as during growth and healing. But, for reasons that are not entirely clear, sometimes these signals can become unbalanced, causing increased blood vessel growth that can lead to abnormal conditions or disease. For example, angiogenesis is the cause of age-related wet macular degeneration. Why is angiogenesis important in cancer? Angiogenesis plays a critical role in the growth of cancer because solid tumors need a blood supply if they are to grow beyond a few millimeters in size. Tumors can actually cause this blood supply to form by giving off chemical signals that stimulate angiogenesis. Tumors can also stimulate nearby normal cells to produce angiogenesis signaling molecules. The resulting new blood vessels “feed” growing tumors with oxygen and nutrients, allowing the tumor to enlarge and the cancer cells to invade nearby tissue, to move throughout the body, and to form new colonies of cancer cells, called metastases. Because tumors cannot grow beyond a certain size or spread without a blood supply, scientists have developed drugs called angiogenesis inhibitors, which block tumor angiogenesis. The goal of these drugs, also called antiangiogenic agents, is to prevent or slow the growth of cancer by starving it of its needed blood supply. How do angiogenesis inhibitors work? Angiogenesis inhibitors are unique cancer-fighting agents because they block the growth of blood vessels that support tumor growth rather than blocking the growth of tumor cells themselves. Angiogenesis inhibitors interfere in several ways with various steps in blood vessel growth. Some are monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize and bind to VEGF. When VEGF is attached to these drugs, it is unable to activate the VEGF receptor. Other angiogenesis inhibitors bind to VEGF and/or its receptor as well as to other receptors on the surface of endothelial cells or to other proteins in the downstream signaling pathways, blocking their activities. Some angiogenesis inhibitors are immunomodulatory drugs—agents that stimulate or suppress the immune system—that also have antiangiogenic properties. In some cancers, angiogenesis inhibitors appear to be most effective when combined with additional therapies. Because angiogenesis inhibitors work by slowing or stopping tumor growth without killing cancer cells, they are given over a long period. What angiogenesis inhibitors are being used to treat cancer in humans? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a number of angiogenesis inhibitors to treat cancer. Most of these are targeted therapies that were developed specifically to target VEGF, its receptor, or other specific molecules involved in angiogenesis. Approved angiogenesis inhibitors include: Axitinib (Inlyta®)  Bevacizumab (Avastin®)  Cabozantinib (Cometriq®)  Everolimus (Afinitor®)  Lenalidomide (Revlimid®)  Lenvatinib mesylate (Lenvima®)  Pazopanib (Votrient®)  Ramucirumab (Cyramza®)  Regorafenib (Stivarga®)  Sorafenib (Nexavar®)  Sunitinib (Sutent®)  Thalidomide (Synovir, Thalomid®)  Vandetanib (Caprelsa®)  Ziv-aflibercept (Zaltrap®)  Do angiogenesis inhibitors have side effects? Side effects of treatment with VEGF-targeting angiogenesis inhibitors can include hemorrhage, clots in the arteries (with resultant stroke or heart attack), hypertension, impaired wound healing, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (a brain disorder), and protein in the urine. Gastrointestinal perforation and fistulas also appear to be rare side effects of some angiogenesis inhibitors. Antiangiogenesis agents that target the VEGF receptor have additional side effects, including fatigue, diarrhea, biochemical hypothyroidism, hand-foot syndrome, cardiac failure, and hair changes.

Learn the reasons why you might want to join a cancer clinical trial. Possible Risks in Treatment Clinical Trials Every clinical trial is different, which means risks can also differ. Some common risks include: The study treatment may not be better than, or even as good as, the standard treatment.  Study treatments may have serious side effects that are worse than those of the standard treatment.  You may be required to make more visits to the doctor and have more tests than if you were receiving standard treatment.  You may have extra expenses related to these extra visits, such as travel, housing, and childcare costs.  Possible Benefits of Joining a Treatment Clinical Trial Some of the benefits to joining a treatment clinical trial may include: The trial may help researchers learn more about cancer and help people in the future.  You might have access to a treatment that is under study that may not be available to people outside the trial.  The research team will watch you closely, adding an extra layer of care to your health.  Though not common, if the treatment being studied is more effective than the standard treatment, you may be among the first to benefit.

The immune system helps your body fight infections and other diseases. It is made up of white blood cells and organs and tissues of the lymph system. Immunotherapy is a type of biological therapy. Biological therapy is a type of treatment that uses substances made from living organisms to treat cancer.  How does immunotherapy work against cancer?  What are the types of immunotherapy?

Where do you go for immunotherapy? How often do you receive immunotherapy? How can you tell if immunotherapy is working? What is the current research in immunotherapy? How do you find clinical trials that are testing immunotherapy? How does immunotherapy work against cancer? As part of its normal function, the immune system detects and destroys abnormal cells and most likely prevents or curbs the growth of many cancers. For instance, immune cells are sometimes found in and around tumors. These cells, called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or TILs, are a sign that the immune system is responding to the tumor. People whose tumors contain TILs often do better than people whose tumors don’t contain them. Even though the immune system can prevent or slow cancer growth, cancer cells have ways to avoid destruction by the immune system. For example, cancer cells may: Have genetic changes that make them less visible to the immune system.  Have proteins on their surface that turn off immune cells.  Change the normal cells around the tumor so they interfere with how the immune system responds to the cancer cells.  Immunotherapy helps the immune system to better act against cancer. What are the types of immunotherapy? Wondering if immunotherapy is an option for you? Connect with a Cancer Information Specialist. Several types of immunotherapy are used to treat cancer. These include: Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are drugs that block immune checkpoints. These checkpoints are a normal part of the immune system and keep immune responses from being too strong. By blocking them, these drugs allow immune cells to respond more strongly to cancer.

	Learn more about immune checkpoint inhibitors.  T-cell transfer therapy, which is a treatment that boosts the natural ability of your T cells to fight cancer. In this treatment, immune cells are taken from your tumor. Those that are most active against your cancer are selected or changed in the lab to better attack your cancer cells, grown in large batches, and put back into your body through a needle in a vein.
	T-cell transfer therapy may also be called adoptive cell therapy, adoptive immunotherapy, or immune cell therapy.
Learn more about T-cell transfer therapy.  Monoclonal antibodies, which are immune system proteins created in the lab that are designed to bind to specific targets on cancer cells. Some monoclonal antibodies mark cancer cells so that they will be better seen and destroyed by the immune system. Such monoclonal antibodies are a type of immunotherapy.
	Monoclonal antibodies may also be called therapeutic antibodies.
Learn more about monoclonal antibodies.  Treatment vaccines, which work against cancer by boosting your immune system’s response to cancer cells. Treatment vaccines are different from the ones that help prevent disease.
	Learn more about cancer treatment vaccines.  Immune system modulators, which enhance the body’s immune response against cancer. Some of these agents affect specific parts of the immune system, whereas others affect the immune system in a more general way.

Which cancers are treated with immunotherapy? Immunotherapy drugs have been approved to treat many types of cancer. However, immunotherapy is not yet as widely used as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. To learn about whether immunotherapy may be used to treat your cancer, see the PDQ® adult cancer treatment summaries and childhood cancer treatment summaries. What are the side effects of immunotherapy? Immunotherapy can cause side effects, many of which happen when the immune system that has been revved-up to act against the cancer also acts against healthy cells and tissues in your body. Learn more about immunotherapy side effects. How is immunotherapy given? Different forms of immunotherapy may be given in different ways. These include: intravenous (IV)
	The immunotherapy goes directly into a vein.  oral
	The immunotherapy comes in pills or capsules that you swallow.  topical
	The immunotherapy comes in a cream that you rub onto your skin. This type of immunotherapy can be used for very early skin cancer.  intravesical
	The immunotherapy goes directly into the bladder.  Where do you go for immunotherapy? You may receive immunotherapy in a doctor’s office, clinic, or outpatient unit in a hospital. Outpatient means you do not spend the night in the hospital. How often do you receive immunotherapy? How often and how long you receive immunotherapy depends on: your type of cancer and how advanced it is  the type of immunotherapy you get  how your body reacts to treatment  You may have treatment every day, week, or month. Some types of immunotherapy given in cycles. A cycle is a period of treatment followed by a period of rest. The rest period gives your body a chance to recover, respond to immunotherapy, and build new healthy cells. How can you tell if immunotherapy is working? You will see your doctor often. He or she will give you physical exams and ask you how you feel. You will have medical tests, such as blood tests and different types of scans. These tests will measure the size of your tumor and look for changes in your blood work. What is the current research in immunotherapy? Researchers are focusing on several major areas to improve immunotherapy, including: Finding solutions for resistance.
	Researchers are testing combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors and other types of immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation therapy to overcome resistance to immunotherapy.  Finding ways to predict responses to immunotherapy.
	Only a small portion of people who receive immunotherapy will respond to the treatment. Finding ways to predict which people will respond to treatment is a major area of research.  Learning more about how cancer cells evade or suppress immune responses against them.
	A better understanding of how cancer cells get around the immune system could lead to the development of new drugs that block those processes.  How to reduce the side effects of treatment with immunotherapy.  How do you find clinical trials that are testing immunotherapy? To find clinical research studies that involve immunotherapy visit Find NCI-Supported Clinical Trials or call the Cancer Information Service, NCI’s contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).

To stay up to date on Funding for Cancer Training news, subscribe to the Cancer Training Branch Newsletter! The NCI Pathway to Independence Award for Early-Stage Postdoctoral Researchers (K99/R00) supports postdoctoral researchers who do not require extended periods of mentored research training beyond their doctoral degrees before transitioning to research independence.  This "Early K99" award will help these researchers to complete needed mentored training and transition in a timely manner to independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions (R00). The “Early K99” program is designed to suit the career paths of postdoctoral fellows pursuing careers in Cancer Data Science,  Cancer Control Science and Cancer Prevention, who typically require only a short period of mentored research training beyond their doctoral degrees before obtaining independent faculty positions. Note: The details on this page are for informational purposes only. Please read and follow all requirements and instructions in the notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) and the Table of IC-Specific Information linked therein before applying for an award. Application review information is described in the funding opportunity. If you have any questions before submitting your application, please contact the relevant NCI program staff listed at the end of this page. Each eligible institution (defined as having a unique DUNS number or NIH IPF number) may submit up to a combined total of four applications (one in Cancer Data Science, one in Cancer Control Science, one in Cancer Prevention, and one in Other Cancer Research as defined below) to any companion funding opportunity or any combination of companion funding opportunities PAR-23-286 (K99/R00 - Independent Clinical Trial Not Allowed), PAR-23-287 (K99/R00 - Independent Clinical Trial Required) or PAR-23-288 (K99/R00 - Independent Basic Experimental Studies with Humans Required). (A) Cancer Data Science: an interdisciplinary field of inquiry in which quantitative and analytical approaches, processes, and systems are both developed and used to extract knowledge and insights from increasingly large and/or complex sets of data. This includes cancer-focused data integration and visualization, systems biology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, informatics, genomics, precision oncology, and developing analytics for epidemiological or biostatistical studies. (B) Cancer Control Science: basic and applied research in the behavioral, social, and population sciences to create or enhance interventions that, independently or in combination with biomedical approaches, reduce cancer risk, incidence, morbidity, and mortality, and improve quality of life. This includes research in epidemiology, behavioral sciences, health services, surveillance, cancer survivorship, and healthcare policy. (C) Molecular/Precision Cancer Prevention: early translational research in cancer prevention is defined as basic research to understand mechanisms of cancer formation, development and progression of cancer precursors, and to translate basic biological knowledge into novel human interventions and human-centered adaption of current interventions with the potential to reduce cancer risk, incidence, and mortality, and improve quality of life. This includes but is not limited to research in molecular and systems biology, diagnostics, vaccine and drug development, pharmacology, and biomedical engineering. (D) Other Cancer Research: includes all scientific fields supported by NCI that are not included in (A), (B), or (C). Applicants proposing research in (D) "Other Cancer Research" may apply only if it is reasonable to expect them to transition to independence with an abbreviated period of mentored research training beyond their original doctoral degrees. Postdoctoral fellows in other areas of NCI-supported research who require additional postdoctoral training are encouraged to apply to the NIH Parent K99/R00 program. The early K99/R00 award is intended to foster the development of a creative, independent research scientist who can establish and sustain a strong, independent research program. It is expected that the Research Plan be based on the candidate’s original ideas and/or hypotheses. The K99 project can be within the overall scope of the mentor’s research awards. However, there should be no text duplication or duplication of the scientific aims, and the candidate’s application should propose a scientific research question that is distinct from the mentor’s pending or active research grants. NCI will not support both a K99/R00 award and an active or pending research grant that propose substantially the same research. Early-stage investigators in Tobacco Regulatory Research might be interested in the following funding opportunities specifically intended for this field of research: RFA-OD-22-025 - Pathway to Independence Award in Tobacco Regulatory Research (K99/R00  - Independent Clinical Trial Not Allowed)  RFA-OD-22-026 - Pathway to Independence Award in Tobacco Regulatory Research (K99/R00  - Independent Clinical Trial  Required )  RFA-OD-22-023 - Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award in Tobacco Regulatory Research (K01 - Independent Clinical Trial Not Allowed)  RFA-OD-22-024 - Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award in Tobacco Regulatory Research (K01 -  Independent Clinical Trial Required)  There is no citizenship requirement for K99 applicants. An applicant may be a citizen or a non-citizen national of the United States, have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence (i.e., possess a currently valid Permanent Resident Card USCIS Form I-551, or other legal verification of such status), or be a non-U.S. citizen.  For applications submitted on behalf of non-U.S. citizens with temporary U.S. visas, visa status during each phase of the K99/R00 Award must allow the PD/PI to conduct the proposed research at the applicant institution.  For the K99 phase of the award, the applicant institution is responsible for determining and documenting, in the K99 application, that the candidate’s visa will allow him or her to remain in the U.S. long enough to complete the K99 phase of the award.  For the R00 phase of the award, the U.S institution at which the R00 phase of the award will be conducted is responsible for determining and documenting, in the R00 application, that the PD/PI’s visa will allow the PD/PI to remain in the U.S. for the duration of the R00 Award.  Postdoctoral and Clinical Fellows Applicants must have no more than 2 years of postdoctoral research experience (i.e., employment in a research position since completing the requirements for the doctorate) at the time of the application due date. Postdoctoral and Clinical Fellows who require more extensive postdoctoral research training are encouraged to apply to the NIH Parent K99/R00 program.  If an applicant achieves independence (i.e., any faculty or non-mentored research position) before a K99 Award is made, neither the K99 Award, nor the R00 Award, will be issued.  K99 phase: 1-2 years  R00 phase: 1-3 years  Up to 5 years of total support  The R00 Institution must provide protected time (9 calendar months or 75% effort) for the duration of the R00 Award.  The R00 Institution may not require the use of R00 funds to offset a typical start-up package (salary and other).  The R00 Institution must provide assurance that the PI's appointment is not contingent on the transfer of the R00 Award to the institution.  The independent phase institution should submit an application on behalf of the candidate for the R00 Award using the PHS 398 Application no later than 2 months prior to the proposed activation date of the R00 Award.
			The R00 application must include: A new face page signed by the R00 phase institutional representative  A new project description page (the project summary or abstract should be updated to reflect current plans for the R00 phase)  Detailed budget pages for a non-modular budget  Biographical sketches (PI, collaborators, and consultants)  A new Resources page  Final Progress Report for the K99 phase  An updated research plan (the specific aims should be updated to reflect current plans for the R00 phase and the updated research plan should be briefly described in less than 5 pages)  An updated Bibliography & References Cited section  A new checklist  A letter from the R00 Department or Division Chairman describing the R00 institution's commitment to the candidate and plans for his/her career development  A final evaluation statement by the K99 phase mentor  Human Subjects If the proposed research involves human subjects, provide: An updated Human Subjects section, including an "Inclusion Enrollment Report"  Current IRB approval or expected approval date (award is not made until final IRB approval is granted)  Vertebrate Animals If the proposed research involves vertebrate animals, provide: An updated Vertebrate Animals section (IACUC approval is JIT information)  Award is not made until final IACUC approval is granted  ** The requested salary must be consistent both with the established salary structure at the institution and with salaries actually provided by the institution from its own funds to other staff members with equivalent qualifications, rank, and responsibilities in the department concerned. Applications must submitted electronically.  Applicants must follow the instructions in the SF424 (R&R) Application Guide, as well as any program-specific instructions in section IV of the Program Announcement.  When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions.  Applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.  For the Early K99/R00 Award: An institutional nomination letter is required  An institution may submit up to a combined total of four applications (one in Cancer Data Science, one in Cancer Control Science, one in Cancer Prevention, and one in Other Cancer Research as defined below) to any companion funding opportunity or any combination of companion funding opportunities PAR-23-286 (K99/R00 - Independent Clinical Trial Not Allowed), PAR-23-287 (K99/R00 - Independent Clinical Trial Required) or PAR-23-288 (K99/R00 - Independent Basic Experimental Studies with Humans Required).

Research Articles   Research Articles  New data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) randomized screening trial show that, after 13 years of follow up, men who underwent annual prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and digital rectal examination (DRE) had a 12 percent higher incidence of prostate cancer than men in the control group but the same rate of death from the disease. No evidence of a mortality benefit was seen in subgroups defined by age, the presence of other illnesses, or pre-trial PSA testing. The results were published January 18, 2012, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. When the PLCO researchers published their initial prostate screening results in 2009, which also revealed no prostate cancer mortality or overall mortality benefit from annual screening, critics countered that participants had not been followed long enough to detect a difference in prostate cancer mortality, if one existed. “The natural history of prostate cancer is so long that 10 to 15 years of follow up is usually the window we look for” when determining the effectiveness of a screening intervention, explained first author Gerald Andriole, M.D., who is chief urologic surgeon at the Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis and the Washington University School of Medicine. The persistent increase in incidence of prostate cancer in the screening arm of the study may indicate that regular screening can lead to overdiagnosis—finding tumors that never would have caused symptoms or death. “Even if there was just a tiny mortality benefit [from prostate cancer screening], overdiagnosis wouldn’t be so bad if we didn’t hurt people. But we do hurt people by finding a lot of trivial cancers that are most often overtreated,” explained Dr. Andriole. The PLCO began in 1993 and enrolled men through mid-2001. More than 38,000 men were randomly assigned to annual screening for 6 years (including DRE for the first 4 years and PSA testing for all 6), and the same number of men were assigned to usual care. Because prostate cancer screening is so common, more than half of the participants in the control arm underwent at least one prostate cancer screening test outside the trial. This contamination made it more difficult to determine whether annual testing affected mortality. However, “the level of screening in the intervention arm was substantially greater than that in the control arm throughout the trial screening period,” wrote the authors. “Every time we screened [in the intervention arm] we got a bump of excess cases,” said Philip Prorok, Ph.D., a lead NCI investigator on the study. “What we can’t say for sure is whether we would have seen more of an effect on mortality had there been absolutely no screening in the control arm.” Another recent large trial, called the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, did report a mortality benefit for prostate cancer screening. Although that trial had less contamination in the control arm, it had other limitations that could bias the results, such as differences in the treatments given to men in the screening and control arms. To help reconcile the differing results from these two trials—the largest trials to date of organized prostate cancer screening—an effort is under way by the NCI-funded Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) to use mathematical modeling to tease out how differences in the trial designs and populations may have contributed to the disparate trial results, explained Paul Pinsky, Ph.D., an NCI investigator on the PLCO trial and consultant to the CISNET project. “Even though the results seem to be disparate, because one [trial] found a [statistically] significant protective effect [on prostate cancer mortality] and one didn’t, it could be because of the ways the trials were designed and carried out,” he said. The CISNET study began in 2011 and is examining data from the two trials. Men and their health providers agree that a more definitive answer is needed as doctors and policy makers seek to understand which, if any, men may benefit from routine prostate cancer screening. In October 2011, the United States Preventive Services Task Force released new draft guidelines for prostate cancer screening for public comment. The new draft guidelines, which are based in part on PLCO findings, recommend against routine PSA testing in men who do not have prostate cancer symptoms. Some doctors think the new recommendations go too far in not accounting for the informed decisions of individual men. “If prostate cancer constitutes a continuum of disease and its overdiagnosis and overtreatment are mainly limited to low-grade disease, then instead of completely eliminating the potential benefits of screening along with the risks, why not consider managing low-risk patients differently?” asked Jeri Kim, M.D., and John W. Davis, M.D., of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in a commentary published December 28, 2011, in JAMA. Practice appears to be moving in this direction, with a greater emphasis on active surveillance instead of immediate treatment for some men who have prostate cancer that is thought to be at low risk of progressing. A big advance, explained Dr. Andriole, would be the ability to predict, even before a biopsy, whether a man with an elevated PSA level is likely to have an aggressive versus a nonaggressive cancer. “There’s a lot of effort now being put into this, and not just for prostate cancer, but for a lot of other cancer types as well,” added Dr. Prorok. “If we diagnose someone with symptoms, or you find something on a screening test, can we eventually find a way to determine for which individuals the cancers are in fact aggressive and need more aggressive treatment, versus some that need less aggressive treatment or don’t need any treatment at all?” Researchers are looking for biomarkers, including genes and proteins, that may give clues to a cancer’s aggressiveness. “If we could selectively change our criteria for biopsy such that only men who are at high risk for aggressive cancer get biopsied, we might be able to substantially shift the overall risk/benefit [ratio] of screening,” said Dr. Andriole.

Staff & Contact Information   Staff & Contact Information  The National Cancer Institute (NCI) established the Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy (OHAM) in the Office of the Director in December 2007 to enhance its research effort in the field of HIV/AIDS and HIV malignancies. OHAM is led by Dr. Robert Yarchoan. OHAM was created to: Provide broad oversight for HIV/AIDS research within and supported by NCI  Facilitate NCI-wide coordination and prioritization of this effort  Manage certain HIV/AIDS-specific research activities  Act as a point of contact with the NIH Office of AIDS Research (OAR) and other Institutes and Centers  OHAM includes two Programs: The AIDS Malignancy Program Led by Dr. Geraldina Dominguez, the AIDS Malignancy Program (AMP) has the primary responsibility for identifying new initiatives, for international activities, such as the initiative to Strengthen Capacity for HIV-Associated Malignancy Research in Africa, and for overseeing programs that the NCI co-manages with other Institutes, such as the Centers for AIDS Research (CFARs), the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), and the Women's Interagency HIV Study.  The AIDS Cancer Clinical Program Led by Dr. Mostafa Nokta, the AIDS Cancer Clinical Program (ACCP) has the primary responsibility for overseeing clinical programs in OHAM, including the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) and the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR).  The mission of the Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy (OHAM) is to facilitate and provide broad oversight for HIV/AIDS and HIV malignancy research throughout the National Cancer Institute (NCI). OHAM works with the NCI Director, the NCI Divisions, and other Offices in the NCI in managing the HIV/AIDS and HIV malignancy research portfolio. OHAM coordinates and prioritizes NCI research in HIV/AIDS and HIV malignancy and, in addition, directly initiates and manages certain research programs. AIDS research is conducted throughout the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and OHAM interfaces with the Office of AIDS Research and other Institutes and Centers in the NIH to effectively coordinate this research effort. The ultimate goal of the OHAM/NCI research effort is to effectively prevent, diagnose, and treat HIV/AIDS, HIV-associated malignancies, and other malignancies developing in individuals with HIV infection. HIV infection and HIV-associated malignancies have a profound impact throughout the world, and OHAM research accordingly has both a domestic and an international focus. OHAM strives to optimize the use of research resources throughout the NCI to advance knowledge in HIV/AIDS and HIV malignancy. The aim of this effort is to effectively prevent, diagnose, and treat these conditions, both in the United States and throughout the rest of the world.  Posted:

Platforms & Tools  Events & Webinars   Molecular Characterization Initiative  Platforms & Tools  The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) Data Ecosystem is a connected network of tools and resources that will bring together clinical, research, and registry data on children, adolescents, and young adults (AYAs) with cancer from separate data repositories (collections of stored data). The ecosystem will also provide tools to use the data in new ways. Users will have easy access to the ecosystem through a centralized portal called the CCDI Hub. The CCDI Hub is an entry point for basic scientists, doctors, data scientists, advocates, patients, and families looking to use and connect with CCDI-related data. The CCDI Data Ecosystem will allow doctors and researchers to access and explore data from children and AYAs with childhood cancer treated at many different academic and medical institutions around the country. The ecosystem’s portal will unify and connect to these data. Connecting and compiling this information from many different sources will give doctors and researchers a more complete understanding of childhood cancers. This could lead to improvements in prevention, treatment, quality of life, and survivorship for children and AYAs with cancer. The CCDI Data Ecosystem will connect new and existing data that comes from different institutions and is stored on various platforms through a centralized portal. Data connected through this ecosystem will need to follow certain standards. Standardizing clinical and research data from multiple sources will make it easier and quicker for researchers to find the data they need to answer key scientific questions, which in turn can speed up childhood cancer research progress. The CCDI Data Ecosystem is still being developed and will eventually include several components. In addition to currently available platforms and tools, the ecosystem will also include data from the CCDI Molecular Characterization Initiative.  Updated:

Funding Resources  Researcher Resources  News & Events  About DCB  Progress   Funding Opportunities  Funding Resources  Shortly after being sworn in as the 17th NCI Director, Dr. W. Kimryn Rathmell gave keynote remarks with vignettes from her career journey at the 2024 DCB New Grantee Workshop. To introduce Dr. Rathmell at the meeting, Dr. Chamelli Jhappan (a science administrator in the DCB Cancer Immunology, Hematology, and Etiology Branch) said, “I hold the distinction of being the program director assigned to the very first R01 of a new grantee, who not only attended this New Grantee Workshop many years ago but has also gone on to be the director of the NCI. And that is a great role model for all of you, something to work toward.” Following this, Dr. Rathmell began her talk by telling DCB new grantees that she remembers being in their place back in 2007. At the time, she was really excited about her first R01 grant, but also wondering how she was going to get a second grant. Next, she shared, that “it's the best time ever to be in cancer research.” Dr. Rathmell explained that recent discoveries in the field are exciting, new technologies are advancing progress, and research is really having an impact on people with cancer. To an audience of new grantees, she continued by describing her grant history. Dr. Rathmell said that others may say, “all of my grants get funded, or I never have a grant that's not discussed”; however, the NCI Director explained that she’s had grant applications that were withdrawn and not discussed, as well as grants that continued for many years. Dr. Rathmell also encouraged earlier stage investigators to reach out to a mentor for help in writing grant applications and to look for multiple sources of funding. During the next part of her talk, Dr. Rathmell discussed her career in cancer research. 
She described her first project, which focused on the generation of mouse models of kidney cancer to examine early drivers of tumorigenesis. Her lab’s studies, specifically some chemical screens in kidney cancer cells, led to investigations of Ror2 (a WNT signaling molecule). It became an interesting treatment target that they explored as part of the NCI Experimental Therapeutics (NExT) program. Now, based on cancer biology research, companies have developed bispecific antibodies targeting Ror2. Along with discussing her scientific research, the NCI Director discussed the importance of Principal Investigator and Program Director interactions. She said, “The program officers are really looking out for you. When you call them and ask questions, they will really help you. They are your advocates.” After describing some of her scientific research projects, Dr. Rathmell discussed mentorship by remarking on the importance of training and fostering the next generation of cancer researchers. “There's something about training people that is really, really special,” she stated. 
Looking to the DCB new grantees, the NCI Director said, “These people that you're training today are going to be people that you are connected to for the rest of your life.” Dr. Rathmell then discussed the importance of moments of discovery through mentorship. She shared that her laboratory was running into challenges in their studies of SETD2 (a histone methyltransferase that's mutated in kidney cancer). They found that when you knock out SETD2 in cancer cells, there’s an excess of bridging chromosomes. When her team started investigating the chromosomes (via old-fashioned metaphase spreads), they observed that the chromosomes had two centromeres. After two years of hard work, they realized that they were palindromic chromosomes that are prone to breaks. Dr. Rathmell explained that with these findings, “we have a super cool mechanism. But every piece [of data] along that step was a trainee running into my office or sending me an email and showing me something interesting.” She further mentioned that those type of moments of scientific discovery are “why we are here” and encouraged new grantees to enjoy those trainee breakthroughs. Along with sharing her experiences as a mentor, Dr. Rathmell also described mentors and role models who helped her during her career. She talked about her graduate school advisor who was one of the people who told her, “You should stay in the lab. It will really be fun, and the science is very cool.” They encouraged her to continue in research throughout the stages of her career journey. This mentor also helped provide guidance and encouragement as Dr. Rathmell was making decisions about her career future, as well as asking questions about raising a family as a scientist. She described her mentor as “somebody who's been a support system for me, all the way through.” Dr. Rathmell advised the DCB new grantees to reach out to and thank their mentors. 
Along with discussing mentees and mentors, Dr. Rathmell also discussed the importance of peer groups during her talk. She shared how Dr. Ned Sharpless, a previous NCI Director, became her peer when they both were starting their laboratories. She got to know him very well as they worked together as new investigators. Dr. Rathmell thinks that he may have thrown her name into the hat for her current position. “So, you never know, but one of these people [at the workshop] might help you be the NCI Director someday,” she stated. The NCI Director also talked about being forming a group with other women researchers, which was called Happy Hour. They would meet once a month to celebrate a win, ranging from getting a paper published to a student having a successful committee meeting. The women from this group are now leading various centers, institutions, and organizations now, around the country. Dr. Rathmell said, “That group was a huge part of my success. I must credit them with helping me make it through.”
She encouraged the new grantees at the meeting to form a strong support system with their peers and communities. Dr. Rathmell closed by discussing some of her goals as the new NCI Director. 
She said, “Investigator-initiated work is definitely my priority.” Dr. Rathmell further explained that she thinks that extramural researchers who are working at the ground level in their field know the next, most exciting things to do for ongoing progress. To end her talk, Dr. Rathmell told the DCB new grantees, “Because we need to make a dent in cancer, we need to make foundational and translational discoveries, as well as make a clinical output that changes the face of cancer. You are all going to do that. So go all in.” If you would like to reproduce some or all of this content, see Reuse of NCI Information for guidance about copyright and permissions.

T!tle : Novel genomic changes in most common type of lung cancer - NCI
ur$ : https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/tcgalungadeno
d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  2014  Study identifies novel genomic changes in the most common type of lung cancer; TCGA finds mutations in a key cancer-causing pathway, expanding targets for existing drugs   News Releases   Posted:
July 9, 2014  240-760-6600 Researchers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network have identified novel mutations in a well-known cancer-causing pathway in lung adenocarcinoma, the most common subtype of lung cancer. Knowledge of these genomic changes may expand the number of possible therapeutic targets for this disease and potentially identify a greater number of patients with treatable mutations because many potent cancer drugs that target these mutations already exist. TCGA is jointly funded and managed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both part of the National Institutes of Health. A TCGA analysis of another, less common, form of lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, was reported in 2012. In this new study, published online July 9, 2014, in the journal Nature, researchers examined the genomes, RNA, and some protein from 230 lung adenocarcinoma samples. In three-quarters of the samples, the scientists ultimately identified mutations that put a cell signaling pathway known as the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway into overdrive. “The integrated nature of TCGA analysis made these findings and their potential therapeutic implications possible,” said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. “We hope this lays the groundwork for future work in precision medicine.” Mutations affecting the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway can cause it to become stuck in the “on” state. As a result, signals that promote cancer cell proliferation and survival are produced continuously. However, some drugs currently available curb aberrant activity of this pathway and prompt therapeutic responses in patients. “Combined with the earlier TCGA analysis of squamous lung cancers, we now have a comprehensive understanding of many of the genetic pathways that lead to cancers of the lung,” said NCI Director Harold Varmus, M.D. “Based on this knowledge, we can now seek better pathway inhibitors to improve patient outcomes. However, for the time being, stopping smoking or never starting remain the most reliable ways to reduce the number of deaths due to lung cancer.” In the group’s initial scan of tumor samples, researchers identified gene mutations that would increase RTK/RAS/RAF pathway activity in 62 percent of the samples. The affected genes are oncogenes, or genes that have the potential to cause cancer when mutated or expressed at high levels. Consequently, these tumor samples were classified as oncogene-positive. To identify additional alterations, the investigators looked at DNA copy number changes, or changes in gene number resulting from the deletion or amplification (multiplication) of sections of DNA in the genome. In doing so, they detected amplification of two oncogenes, ERBB2 and MET, which are part of the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway. Gene amplification usually leads to increased expression of the encoded protein in cells. Now that these amplifications have been identified, clinicians may be able to treat patients whose tumors have specific gene changes with drugs currently available or under development. “It is quite striking that we have now identified an actionable mutation in over 75 percent of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, a significant improvement from a decade ago,” said Matthew Meyerson, M.D., Ph.D., Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, The Broad Institute, and one of the lead investigators on the project. Additional analysis identified other genes that may play important roles in lung cancer development. Mutations in one of these genes, NF1, had previously been reported in lung cancer; NF1 is a known tumor suppressor gene that regulates the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway. Mutations in NF1 also put the pathway into overdrive. Another mutated gene, RIT1, is also part of the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway, and this is the first study to associate mutation of this gene with lung cancer. “This most recent TCGA study again demonstrates the power, depth and breadth of TCGA data,” said NHGRI Director Eric Green, M.D., Ph.D. “These results give us important new genomic insights into the development and behavior of an important form of cancer.” In the aggregate, the several forms of lung cancer comprise the most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with more than 1 million deaths annually. NCI estimates that only 17.5 percent of people diagnosed with lung cancer are still alive five years later. Lung adenocarcinoma, the most common form of the disease in the United States, develops in tissues near the outer parts of the lungs and can spread widely. Although smoking is the main risk factor, adenocarcinoma is also the most common type of lung cancer among lifelong non-smokers and the risk of lung cancer is increased by 20 percent to 30 percent by exposure to secondhand smoke. In addition to the two lung cancer studies, the TCGA Research Network has generated data and published analyses on a number of cancers, all of which can be found on the TCGA website. TCGA-generated data are freely available at the TCGA Data Portal and CGHub. This work was supported by the following NIH grants: U24 CA126561, U24 CA126551, U24 CA126554, U24 CA126543, U24 CA126546, U24 CA137153, U24 CA126563, U24 CA126544, U24 CA143845, U24 CA143858, U24 CA144025, U24 CA143882, U24 CA143866, U24 CA143867, U24 CA143848, U24 CA143840, U24 CA143835, U24 CA143799, U24 CA143883, U24 CA143843, U54 HG003067, U54 HG003079 and U54 HG003273. ### Reference: The Cancer Genome Atlas Network authors.

Annual Report to the Nation


Research Advances by Cancer Type


Stories of Discovery


Milestones in Cancer Research and Discovery   Annual Report to the Nation  Research Advances by Cancer Type  Stories of Discovery  Milestones in Cancer Research and Discovery  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common form of blood cancer in adults. In 2012, an estimated 70,130 new cases of NHL were diagnosed in the United States.  NHL most often arises from B cells, which are immune cells responsible for producing antibodies.  The National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded the development of rituximab, one of the first monoclonal antibody (antibodies that target one specific protein) cancer treatments. It plays a key role in increasing survival for patients with NHL.  Prior to the introduction of rituximab in 1997, the number of new cases of NHL increased each year. Since then, deaths from NHL have gone down each year and continue to drop.  Antibodies are produced by the immune system to help fight infections. Scientists long thought that if antibodies could be created to recognize specific proteins on cancer cells, the immune system could be used to destroy the cancer. Researchers also thought that by targeting cancer cells and avoiding destructive effects on normal cells, treatment might be more effective and with fewer harmful side effects than traditional chemotherapy. In 1975, NCI-funded researchers César Milstein, Ph.D., and Georges Köhler, Ph.D., took the first steps toward creating such a treatment by producing antibodies that target one specific portion, or epitope, of a particular protein. These are called monoclonal antibodies. The first test of this treatment occurred in 1980 in a patient with NHL, the most common form of blood cancer in adults. While this first trial did not cure the patient, it paved the way for the use of monoclonal antibodies as a cancer treatment. Based on this groundbreaking work, Drs. Milstein and Köhler received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1984. Later research showed that these antibodies use the body’s immune system to destroy cancer cells. But for this treatment to work, researchers first needed to find a specific protein to target on NHL B cells, a group of white blood cells that are a vital part of the immune system. In 1988, scientists identified a protein known as CD20 on B cells. Although CD20 is found on both healthy and cancerous B cells, it is not found on immature or developing B cells. Therefore, a treatment that targeted this protein would eliminate both cancerous and healthy mature B cells, but most of the immature B cells would remain to replenish the supply of healthy cells following treatment. With CD20 as a potential antitumor target, Biogen Idec, a biotechnology company, developed rituximab (Rituxan) to specifically bind to CD20 and eliminate cancerous B cells. In initial studies, almost half of the patients with NHL who did not respond to previous chemotherapy responded to rituximab with either full or partial remission of their cancer. Patients also experienced fewer side effects than with traditional chemotherapy. Subsequent studies showed that a combination of rituximab with traditional chemotherapy could significantly prolong survival in patients with NHL. Currently, this combination is used as a first-line therapy for several types of NHL. Rituximab’s significant antitumor activity led to the development of more than a dozen new monoclonal antibody cancer treatments. This type of targeted treatment has changed the course of treatment for many types of cancer. Prior to genomic sequencing (a process that determines the DNA sequence of a specific cell or organism), doctors relied heavily on seeing tumor cells at the microscopic level to determine the type of tumor. Yet, even though tumor cells look alike, they can actually be very different and respond differently to treatment. As researchers learn more about the differences between normal and tumor cells at the molecular level, they are developing treatments to reduce how severe a cancer may be or to eliminate it altogether. The discovery of rituximab paved the way for targeted treatments that are revolutionizing cancer treatment and improving patient outcomes every day. Some important monoclonal antibody treatments that have followed in rituximab’s footsteps include trastuzumab (Herceptin) for breast and gastric cancer, ipilimumab (Yervoy) for melanoma, and bevacizumab (Avastin) for colon cancer. The success of rituximab and other monoclonal antibodies in treating cancer has fostered great interest in expanding the use of antibody treatments. One area showing promise is called immunoconjugate therapy. This treatment links antibodies to a second drug or radioactive molecule. Scientists think this approach can be used to target cancer cells directly to destroy them. Ideally, this treatment would spare healthy cells and prevent many of the serious side effects often caused by chemotherapy. The potential for this approach in cancer treatment has already been realized. By linking radioactive iodine-131 to the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, GlaxoSmithKlein, a pharmaceutical company, developed tositumomab (Bexxar), which delivers radiation specifically to B cells, thereby limiting cell death to B cells alone. In 2003, the FDA approved the use of this drug in patients with NHL. Because rituximab targets B cells, researchers want to know if it also can be used to treat other similar B-cell type diseases, including autoimmune diseases. Rituximab has already been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, where it has been shown to greatly reduce symptoms and prevent joint damage. Currently, clinical trials are looking at whether rituximab also can help people with multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Prior to the introduction of rituximab in 1997, the incidence of NHL was steadily increasing. Since then, mortality rates have declined by about three percent each year and continue to drop. NCI supported research to determine which patients may benefit most from rituximab treatment and which combinations of chemotherapy work best to improve survival in patients with NHL. NCI also funded a broad portfolio of research that uncovered how tumor cells work, as well as clinical trials that demonstrated the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies as a targeted treatment against cancer cells. With the discovery of rituximab, more than 70 percent of patients diagnosed with NHL now live five years past their initial diagnosis. Rituximab paved the way for targeted cancer treatments. These targeted treatments have revolutionized cancer care and improve patient outcomes every day. American Cancer Society. Immunotherapy: Monoclonal Antibodies. 2013. American Cancer Society.

Given these may include unfamiliar roles outside of traditional bench science, we have invited guest speakers from various science-based backgrounds to provide information and insight that will help inform decisions about potential future endeavors. Speakers from biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, government organizations and other fields present on diverse topics and share their experiences and individual journeys while describing best practices for getting a job, setting work expectations and navigating unique business-oriented scientific cultures.  Many of the speakers are former scientists who have successfully transitioned to different science-based career tracks outside of academia.  If you are thinking about choosing a non-independent research-based career path, this workshop will help shed light on how to position yourself while at NIH and improve your chances of success in the future. The biographies of invited speakers will help reveal the types of job functions on which they will be presenting. Each workshop session covers topics such as: Interpreting different job postings  What companies look for in candidates  Cover letter and resume writing best practices for specific jobs and industries  Project management  Developing communication and leadership skills–effectively conveying these skills to employers  How to leverage experiences at NCI to develop the skills to succeed in industry  Industry business culture  Expectations for collaboration across divisions within companies  Transitioning from academic research to industry–new and different roles  Scientific communication, strategy development, and writing  Technology transfer  Navigating USA Jobs  Preparation required for different science-based career options  Metrics for success  Some of the major takeaways from previous workshops include: There are significant differences in the application and interview processes for non-academic jobs versus independent academic research positions.  It is far better to begin your job preparation earlier rather than later (preferably during your first year at NIH), but it is never too late to start!  There are many positions existing within industry and the government that does not involve bench sciences and requires unique processes and preparation.

Past Events  About DCB  Progress   Past Events  The recent wealth of genomic data has enabled the identification of mutation signatures in a wide range of normal and tumor cells. Progress in this area has been accelerated by computational methods and experimental approaches to link exogenous (e.g., chemical mutagen) and endogenous (e.g., DNA repair defect) factors to specific mutation patterns. The understanding and application of mutation signatures has increased our knowledge of cancer etiology, population exposures, mutagenic processes and treatment response. To examine the current state of the science and future opportunities for cancer research focusing on mutation signatures, the NCI Symposium on Mutation Signatures and Cancer was virtually held on December 2-3, 2021. The meeting was chaired by Dr. Ludmil Alexandrov (University of California, San Diego) and Dr. Maria Teresa Landi (NCI DCEG) and examined several key areas in the field of mutation signatures: normal and cancer tissues, exogenous and endogenous processes, analytical approaches, and translational aspects.

He began his research career as an organic chemist, only later turning to biology. He believes that this hybrid training enables him to “think chemically” but with a deep enough understanding of biology to know what to focus on in addressing major biomedical challenges. Importantly, he believes we need to unwind many of our assumptions about things and conduct research in an open-minded, open-ended way. “That will lead us to fundamental discoveries,” he said, “and, every so often, you’ll overturn some dogma and that will be the crack in the problem.” Encouraged by pioneers in the study of oncogenes—altered genes that have the potential to cause cancer—Kevan entered the field of cancer drug discovery. Among the oncogenes he sought to target were members of the RAS gene family, which play an important role in more than 30% of all human cancers, including 95% of pancreatic cancers, 45% of colorectal cancers, and 35% of lung cancers. The proteins produced by RAS oncogenes had long been thought to be “undruggable” because they lack a clear binding site for drug attachment. Kevan, however, prefers to view them as “not yet drugged.” With the support of NCI funding, Kevan’s team focused initially on a mutant form of the KRAS gene that occurs in non-small cell lung cancer. Using a technology that had not previously been applied to oncogenes, they successfully inhibited the protein by chemically binding, or tethering, small molecules to the part of the protein that was altered by mutation. Additional research showed, however, that these small molecules bound to what was thought to be an inactive form of the protein. Before this finding, it had been universally accepted that mutant RAS proteins were locked in an active state and that successful RAS inhibitors would target that active state. Not only were these two long-standing beliefs overturned by this research, further research would show that cancer-causing mutants in a RAS-related protein, which was supposedly in its inactive state, actually exists in the active state. “Many of the assumptions we’ve made, about proteins we’ve studied a lot in cancer, are wrong,” Kevan said, “and these assumptions are hindering our ability to make discoveries.” He believes that findings like these underscore the need for more basic research. He also said that it is very important for NCI to sustain funding for cancer drug discovery aimed at high-value targets, such as RAS, and even to prioritize high-risk, high-reward science. “We don’t have enough discoveries on the table to add them up in different ways to construct the next major drug,” he said. “We need more discoveries.”  Posted:

Past Programs  Funding  Researcher Resources  News & Events  About DCB  Progress   Past Programs  Melissa Kemp, Ph.D., a CSBC investigator at the Georgia Institute of Technology, studies the metabolic state of cells and how it affects cell signaling pathways. During her postdoc, she trained with several current CSBC members, including Doug Lauffenburger, Peter Sorger, and Forest White, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Cell Decision Process Center. Now, she uses systems biology approaches to understand redox metabolism in tumors. In this interview, she discusses her career journey in engineering, her views on cancer systems biology, and her CSBC research focused on head and neck cancer. After my freshman year of college, I struggled to find a summer job. Even though I started as a biology major, I didn’t have any relevant coursework or lab experience to get a research position. I also got back home later than other students, so all the retail jobs were taken. I ended up volunteering at the Cleveland Clinic in a protein crystallography lab. It was really eye opening for me because I was in a clinical research setting where everyone had a Ph.D. in physics. It helped me see that I didn’t need to be a biology major to do biomedical research. I came back to the MIT for my sophomore year and decided to get an engineering degree. I started looking into relevant engineering majors and stumbled upon the radiation sciences and medical physics track within the nuclear engineering program. It was a perfect fit for me, and included classes in biology, organic chemistry, and quantitative physiology. At the time, there was interesting research going on in the department using computational modeling. That is how I ended up going into computational biology, which has been a common thread throughout my research career. Scientists can characterize cancer cells in such incredible detail that traditional biology approaches are overwhelmed with the amount of data that’s being collected. Training students and postdocs in systems biology really sets them up to get new insights about patient variability and unknown mechanisms. I think there’s a lot to be learned from using systems approaches. It’s incredibly important to teach the next generation of scientists how to use systems biology tools and how to develop their own tools early on in their careers. I think it’s important in systems biology to really understand where your data is coming from. If my lab was just a modeling resource for crunching the data that’s being generated at other sites, then we would be at a disadvantage in the biological interpretation. Since we’re also doing some of the experiments, we have an understanding of the cell lines the other labs are using, why certain techniques are good or not so good for the questions we’re asking, and more. This gives us a stronger ability to integrate all this biological information into comprehensive models. My collaborator, Cristina Furdui, has a lot of expertise in head and neck cancer. Until we started working on this project together, I knew very little about this type of cancer. The initiation of head and neck tumors is often related to oxidative stress through tobacco, alcohol, and human papillomavirus exposures. Also, the primary ways in which people treat head and neck cancers, specifically ionizing radiation and platinum-based drugs, are related to the induction of reactive oxygen species. We felt that by tackling redox metabolism in head and neck cancer and its role in the actions of new cancer drugs, we could make significant research progress on this type of cancer. I think that flux balance analysis modeling is going to be useful for the development of personalized models for cancer patients. This approach leverages transcriptomic data to make predictions about the metabolic activity in a patient. By looking at different enzymes that are contributing to the overall production of a single metabolite, the model predicts how quickly a patient is going to metabolize a chemotherapeutic drug. Ideally, we want to use these types of models to come up with a handful of biomarkers for predicting the potency of a drug without having to do huge transcriptomic-wide analyses.

As a result, most cervical cancer cases are diagnosed in women who live in regions with inadequate screening protocols. Estimated new cases and deaths from cervical (uterine cervix) cancer in the United States in 2024:[2] New cases: 13,820. Deaths: 4,360. The uterine cervix is contiguous with the uterine body,  and it acts as the opening to the body of the uterus. The uterine cervix is a cylindrical, fibrous organ that is an average of 3 to 4 cm in length.  The portio of the cervix is visible on vaginal inspection.  The opening of the cervix is termed the external os.  The os is the beginning of the endocervical canal, which forms the inner aspect of the cervix.  At the upper aspect of the endocervical canal is the internal os, a narrowing of the endocervical canal.  The narrowing marks the transition from the cervix to the uterine body.  The endocervical canal beyond the internal os is termed the endometrial canal. The cervix is lined by two types of epithelial cells: squamous cells at the outer aspect and columnar, glandular cells along the inner canal.   The transition between squamous cells and columnar cells is an area termed the squamocolumnar junction.  Most precancerous and cancerous changes arise in this zone. Cervical carcinoma begins at the squamocolumnar junction. It can involve the outer squamous cells, inner glandular cells, or both.  The precursor lesion is
dysplasia: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or adenocarcinoma in situ,
which can subsequently become invasive cancer.  This process can be quite slow. 
Longitudinal studies have shown that in patients with untreated in situ
cervical cancer, 30% to 70% will develop invasive carcinoma over a period of 10
to 12 years.  However, in about 10% of patients, lesions can progress from in
situ to invasive in less than  1 year.  As it becomes invasive, the
tumor breaks through the basement membrane and invades the cervical stroma. 
Extension of the tumor in the cervix may ultimately manifest as ulceration,
exophytic tumor, or extensive infiltration of underlying tissue, including
the bladder or rectum. Increasing age is the most important risk factor for most cancers. The primary risk factor for cervical cancer is human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.[3-6] Other risk factors for cervical cancer include the following: High parity and HPV infection.[7] Smoking cigarettes and HPV infection.[8] Long-term use of oral contraceptives and HPV infection.[9,10] Immunosuppression.[11,12] Having first sexual encounter at a young age.[13] High number of sexual partners.[13] Exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero.[14] HPV infection is a necessary step in the development of virtually all precancerous and cancerous lesions.  Epidemiological studies convincingly demonstrate that the major risk factor for development of preinvasive or invasive carcinoma of the cervix is HPV infection, far outweighing other known risk factors. More than 6 million
women in the United States are estimated to be infected with  HPV. Transient HPV infection is common, particularly in young women,[15] while cervical cancer is rare.  The persistence of an HPV infection leads to increased risk of developing  precancerous and cancerous lesions.[16,17] The strain of HPV infection is also important in conferring risk.  Multiple subtypes of HPV infect humans; subtypes 16 and 18 have been most closely associated with high-grade dysplasia and cancer.  Studies  suggest that acute infection with HPV types 16 and
18 conferred an 11-fold to 16.9-fold risk of rapid development of high-grade CIN.[18-20] Further studies have shown that infection with either HPV 16 or 18 is more predictive than cytological screening of high-grade CIN or greater disease, and that the predictive ability is seen for up to 18 years after the initial test.[21-23] There are two commercially available vaccines that target anogenital-related strains of HPV.  The vaccines are directed toward HPV-naïve adolescents and young adults. Although penetration of the vaccine has been moderate, significant decreases in HPV-related diseases have been documented.[24]   For more information, see Cervical Cancer Prevention. Early cervical cancer may not cause noticeable signs or symptoms. Possible signs and symptoms of cervical cancer include the following: Vaginal bleeding. Unusual vaginal discharge. Pelvic pain. Dyspareunia. Postcoital bleeding. The following procedures may be used to diagnose cervical cancer: History and physical exam. Pelvic exam. Cervical cytology (Pap smear). HPV test. Endocervical curettage. Colposcopy. Biopsy. Cervical cytology (Pap smear) has been the mainstay of cervical cancer screening since its introduction.   However, molecular techniques for the identification of HPV DNA are highly sensitive and specific.  Current screening options include the following: Cytology alone. Cytology and HPV testing. HPV testing is suggested when it is likely to successfully triage patients into low- and high-risk groups for a high-grade dysplasia or greater lesion. HPV DNA tests are unlikely to separate patients with low-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesions into those who do and those who do not need further evaluation. 
A study of 642 women found that 83% had one  or more tumorigenic HPV types
when cervical cytological specimens were assayed by a sensitive (hybrid capture)
technique.[25]  The authors of the study and an accompanying editorial
concluded that using HPV DNA testing in this setting does not add sufficient
information to justify its cost.[25] HPV DNA testing has proven
useful in triaging patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance to colposcopy and has been integrated into current screening guidelines.[25-27] Other studies show that patients with low-risk cytology and high-risk HPV infection
with types 16, 18, and 31 are more likely to have CIN or microinvasive histopathology on biopsy.[18,28-30]  One
method has also shown that integration of HPV types 16 and 18 into the genome,
leading to transcription of  viral and cellular messages, may predict
patients who are at greater risk of high-grade dysplasia and invasive
cancer.[31] For women older than 30 years who are more likely to have persistent HPV infection, HPV typing can successfully triage women into high- and low-risk groups for CIN 3 or worse disease.  In this age group, HPV DNA testing is more effective than cytology alone in predicting the risk of developing CIN 3 or worse.[32]  Other studies have shown the effectiveness of a primary HPV DNA–screening strategy with cytology triage over  the previously used cytology-based screening algorithms.[33,34] The
prognosis for patients with cervical cancer is markedly affected by the extent of disease at the
time of diagnosis. More than 90% of cervical cancer cases
can be detected early by using the Pap test and HPV testing.[35] Pap and HPV testing are not performed on approximately 33% of eligible women, which results in a higher-than-expected death rate. Clinical stage as a prognostic factor is supplemented by several gross and microscopic pathological findings in surgically treated patients. Evidence (clinical stage and other findings): In a large,
surgicopathological staging study of patients with clinical stage IB disease
reported by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) (GOG-49), the factors that most prominently predicted
 lymph node metastases and a decrease in disease-free
survival were capillary-lymphatic space involvement by tumor, increasing tumor
size, and increasing depth of stromal invasion, with the latter being the most
important and reproducible.[36,37] In a study of 1,028 patients treated with
radical surgery, survival rates correlated more consistently with tumor volume
(as determined by precise volumetry of the tumor) than with clinical or histological
stage.[38] A multivariate analysis of prognostic variables in 626 patients with
locally advanced disease (primarily stages II, III, and IV) studied by the GOG 
identified the following variables that were significant for progression-free interval and
survival:[39] Periaortic and pelvic lymph node status. Tumor size. Patient age. Performance status. Bilateral disease. Clinical stage. The study confirmed the overriding importance of positive periaortic
nodes and suggested further evaluation of these nodes in locally advanced
cervical cancer. The status of the pelvic nodes was important only if the
periaortic nodes were negative.  This was also true for tumor size. It is controversial whether
adenocarcinoma of the cervix carries a significantly worse prognosis than
squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.[40]  Several population-based and retrospective studies showed a worse outcome for patients with adenocarcinoma, with an increase in distant metastasis compared with  those with squamous histology.[41-44] Reports
conflict about  the effect of adenosquamous cell type on outcome.[45,46]  One report
showed that approximately 25% of apparent squamous tumors have
demonstrable mucin production and behave more aggressively than their pure
squamous counterparts, suggesting that any adenomatous differentiation may
confer a negative prognosis.[47] In a large
series of cervical cancer patients treated by radiation therapy, the incidence
of distant metastases (most frequently to the lung, abdominal cavity, liver, and
gastrointestinal tract) was shown to increase  as the stage of disease
increased, from 3% in stage IA to 75% in stage IVA.[48]  A multivariate analysis of factors
influencing the incidence of distant metastases showed stage, endometrial
extension of tumor, and pelvic tumor control to be significant indicators of
distant dissemination.[48] GOG studies have indicated that prognostic factors vary depending on whether clinical or surgical staging is used and with different treatments. Delay in radiation delivery completion is associated with poorer progression-free survival when clinical staging is used. Stage, tumor grade, race, and age  are uncertain  prognostic factors in studies using chemoradiation.[49] Other prognostic factors that may affect outcome include the following: HIV status: Women with HIV have more aggressive and
advanced disease and a poorer prognosis.[50] C-myc overexpression: A study of patients with known
invasive squamous carcinoma of the cervix found that overexpression of the
C-myc oncogene was associated with a poorer prognosis.[51] Number of cells in S phase: The number of cells in
S phase may also have prognostic significance in early cervical carcinoma.[52] HPV-18 DNA: HPV-18 DNA is an independent adverse molecular prognostic factor. Two studies have shown a worse outcome when HPV-18 was identified in cervical cancers of patients undergoing radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy.[53,54] A polymorphism in the Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase enzyme, which is related to folate metabolism, has been shown to decrease response to cisplatin, and as a result is associated with poorer outcomes.[55] High-quality studies are lacking, and the optimal follow-up for patients after treatment for cervical cancer is unknown.  Retrospective studies have shown that cancer recurrence is most likely within the first 2 years.[56]  As a result, most guidelines suggest routine follow-up every 3 to 4 months for the first 2  years, followed by evaluations every 6 months.  Most recurrences are diagnosed secondary to new patient symptoms and signs,[57,58] and the usefulness of routine testing, including a Pap smear and chest x-ray, is unclear. Follow-up should be centered around a thorough history and physical examination with a careful review of symptoms. Imaging should be reserved for evaluation of a positive finding.   Patients should be asked about possible warning signs, including the following: Abdominal pain. Back pain. Painful or swollen leg. Problems with urination. Cough. Fatigue. The follow-up examination should also screen for possible complications of previous treatment because of  the multiple modalities (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation) that  patients often undergo during their treatment.

adenocarcinoma makes up approximately 10% of cervical cancers.  Adenosquamous
and small cell carcinomas are relatively rare.  Primary sarcomas of the cervix
and primary and secondary malignant lymphomas of the cervix have also been reported. FIGO Stage Groupings and Definitions Carcinoma of the cervix can spread via local invasion, the
regional lymphatics, or bloodstream.  Tumor dissemination is generally a
function of the extent and invasiveness of the local lesion.  While cancer of
the cervix generally progresses in an orderly manner, occasionally a small
tumor with distant metastasis is seen.  For this reason, patients must be
carefully evaluated for metastatic disease. Pretreatment surgical staging is the most accurate method to determine the extent
of disease,[1] but  there is little evidence to demonstrate overall improved
survival with routine surgical staging; the staging is usually performed only as
part of a clinical trial.  Pretreatment surgical staging in bulky but locally
curable disease may be indicated in select cases when a nonsurgical search for
metastatic disease is negative.  If abnormal nodes are detected by computed tomography (CT) scan or
lymphangiography, fine-needle aspiration should be negative before a surgical
staging procedure is performed. Tests and procedures to evaluate the extent of the disease include the following: CT scan. Positron emission tomography scan. Cystoscopy. Laparoscopy. Chest x-ray. Ultrasonography.[2] Magnetic resonance imaging.[2] The Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer  have designated staging to define cervical cancer; the FIGO system is most commonly used.[3,4] Gold MA, Tian C, Whitney CW, et al.: Surgical versus radiographic determination of para-aortic lymph node metastases before chemoradiation for locally advanced cervical carcinoma: a Gynecologic Oncology Group Study.

Chemoradiation TherapyFluorouracil dosing Surgery and Radiation Therapy Fluorouracil dosing Patterns-of-care studies clearly demonstrate the negative prognostic effect of
increasing tumor volume and spread pattern.[1]
  Treatment, therefore,  may vary within each stage as
 the individual stages are currently defined by Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO). Five randomized phase III trials (GOG-85, RTOG-9001, GOG-120, GOG-123, and SWOG-8797) have shown an overall survival advantage for
cisplatin-based therapy given concurrently with radiation therapy,[2-6] while one 
trial examining this regimen demonstrated no benefit.[7] The patient
populations in these studies included women with FIGO stages IB2 to IVA
cervical cancer treated with primary radiation therapy and women with FIGO
stages I to IIA disease who were found to have poor prognostic factors (metastatic
disease in pelvic lymph nodes, parametrial disease, or positive surgical
margins) at the time of primary surgery. Although the positive trials vary in terms of the stage of disease, dose of radiation, and schedule of
cisplatin and radiation, the trials demonstrate significant survival benefit for
this combined approach.  The risk of death from cervical cancer was decreased
by 30% to 50% with the use of  concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Based on these results,  strong
consideration should be given to the incorporation of concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy with radiation therapy in women who require radiation
therapy for treatment of cervical cancer.[2-6] Other studies have validated these results.[8-10] The DPYD gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in DPYD, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[11,12] Patients with the DPYD*2A variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other DPYD variants have been identified,  with a range of clinical effects.[11-13] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on  the patient's DPYD genotype and number of functioning DPYD alleles.[14-16] DPYD genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to  a lack of national guidelines.[17] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[18] Surgery and radiation therapy are equally
effective for early stage, small-volume disease.[19]  Younger patients may
benefit from  surgery  to preserve the ovaries and avoid
vaginal atrophy and stenosis. Therapy for patients with cancer of the cervical stump is effective and yields 
results that are comparable with those seen in patients with an intact uterus.[20] Lanciano RM, Won M, Hanks GE: A reappraisal of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system for cervical cancer.

100%.  Either expert colposcopic-directed biopsy or cone biopsy is required to
exclude invasive disease before therapy is undertaken.  A correlation between
cytology and colposcopic-directed biopsy is also necessary before local
ablative therapy is done.  Unrecognized invasive disease treated with
inadequate ablative therapy may be the most common cause of failure.[2] 
Failure to identify the disease, lack of correlation between the Pap smear and
colposcopic findings, adenocarcinoma in situ, or extension of disease into the
endocervical canal makes a laser, loop, or cold-knife conization mandatory. The choice of treatment  depends on the extent of disease and several patient factors, including
age, cell type, desire to preserve fertility, and medical condition. Treatment options for in situ cervical cancer include the following: Conization.Cold-knife conization (scalpel).Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP).[3,4]Laser therapy.[5] Hysterectomy for postreproductive patients. Internal radiation therapy for medically inoperable patients. Cold-knife conization (scalpel). Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP).[3,4] Laser therapy.[5] Hysterectomy is the standard treatment for patients with adenocarcinoma in situ.  The disease, which originates in the endocervical canal, may be more difficult to completely excise with a conization procedure.  Conization may be offered to select patients with adenocarcinoma in situ who desire future fertility. When the endocervical canal is involved, laser or cold-knife conization may be used for selected patients to preserve the uterus, avoid radiation therapy, and more extensive surgery.[6] In selected cases, the outpatient LEEP may be an acceptable alternative to cold-knife conization.  This procedure requires only local anesthesia and obviates the
risks associated with general anesthesia for cold-knife conization.[7-9] 
However, controversy exists about  the adequacy of LEEP as a replacement for
conization; LEEP is unlikely to be sufficient for patients with adenocarcinoma in situ.[10] Evidence (conization using LEEP): A trial comparing LEEP with cold-knife cone biopsy showed no
difference in the likelihood of complete excision of dysplasia.[6] Two 
case reports suggested that the use of LEEP in patients with occult invasive
cancer led to an inability to accurately determine depth of invasion when a
focus of the cancer was transected.[11] Hysterectomy is standard therapy for women with cervical adenocarcinoma in situ because of the location of the disease in the endocervical canal and the possibility of skip lesions in this region, making margin status a less reliable prognostic factor. However, the effect of hysterectomy compared with conservative surgical measures on mortality has not been studied.  Hysterectomy may be performed for squamous cell carcinoma in situ if conization is not possible because of  previous surgery, or if positive margins are noted after conization therapy.  Hysterectomy is not an acceptable front-line therapy for squamous carcinoma in situ.[12] For medically inoperable patients, a
single intracavitary insertion with tandem and ovoids for 5,000 mg hours
(80 Gy vaginal surface dose) may be used.[13] Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. General information about clinical trials is also available.

Total hysterectomy. If the depth of invasion is less than 3 mm, no vascular
or lymphatic channel invasion is noted, and the margins of the cone are
negative, conization alone may be appropriate in patients who wish  to preserve
fertility.[1] If the depth of invasion is  less than 3 mm, which is
 proven by cone biopsy with clear margins,[2] no vascular or lymphatic
channel invasion is noted, and the frequency of lymph-node involvement is
sufficiently low,   lymph-node dissection at the time of hysterectomy is not required. Oophorectomy is
optional and should be deferred for younger women. Treatment options for stage IA2 cervical cancer include the following: Modified radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy. Radical trachelectomy. Intracavitary radiation therapy. For patients with tumor invasion between 3 mm  and 5
mm, modified radical hysterectomy with pelvic-node dissection has been
recommended because of a reported risk of lymph-node metastasis of as much as
10%.[2] Radical hysterectomy with node dissection may also be
considered for patients for whom the depth of tumor invasion was uncertain because of 
invasive tumor at the cone margins. Evidence (open abdominal surgery  [open] versus minimally invasive surgery [MIS]): A multicenter, international, randomized trial, the Laparoscopic Approach to Cervical Cancer  (LACC [NCT00614211])  trial explored the efficacy of radical hysterectomy and staging via open abdominal surgery versus MIS for patients with early-stage cervical cancer.[3]   Patients with stages IA1 (with lymphovascular space invasion), IA2, and IB1 disease and histological subtypes of squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma were eligible for inclusion.  The primary end point was noninferiority of MIS compared with open surgery. The metric used was the percent of disease-free patients   at 4.5 years postsurgery.  The secondary end points were a comparison of the recurrence and survival rates between the two groups.Of the planned 740 patients, 632 were accrued when the study was stopped early because of  an imbalance in deaths between the two groups.  Of 631 eligible patients, 319 were assigned to MIS and 312 to open surgery.   The disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 4.5 years was 86% for the MIS group and 96.5% for the open group, a difference of 10.6 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI],  -16.4 to -4.7).  At 3 years, the MIS group had a DFS rate of 91.2% versus 97.1% for the open surgery group (hazard ratio [HR] for disease recurrence or death, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.63–8.58).  The MIS group also had a lower overall survival (OS) rate at 3 years (OS, 93.8% vs. 99.0% for the open surgery group; HR for death from any cause, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.77–20.30).[3][Level of evidence A1]  The study concluded that MIS was inferior to an open abdominal approach and should not replace open surgery as the standard for patients with cervical cancer. An epidemiological study used two large U.S. databases, the National Cancer Database (NCDB) and the  Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Database, and confirmed a reduction in OS in patients undergoing MIS radical hysterectomy for stage IA2 and stage IB1 cervical cancer from 2010 to 2013.   Additionally, among women who underwent radical hysterectomy in the years 2000 to 2010, there was a decrease in OS after 2006, coincident with the widespread adoption of MIS for cervical cancer.[4][Level of evidence C1] Of the planned 740 patients, 632 were accrued when the study was stopped early because of  an imbalance in deaths between the two groups.  Of 631 eligible patients, 319 were assigned to MIS and 312 to open surgery. The disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 4.5 years was 86% for the MIS group and 96.5% for the open group, a difference of 10.6 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI],  -16.4 to -4.7).  At 3 years, the MIS group had a DFS rate of 91.2% versus 97.1% for the open surgery group (hazard ratio [HR] for disease recurrence or death, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.63–8.58). The MIS group also had a lower overall survival (OS) rate at 3 years (OS, 93.8% vs. 99.0% for the open surgery group; HR for death from any cause, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.77–20.30).[3][Level of evidence A1] The study concluded that MIS was inferior to an open abdominal approach and should not replace open surgery as the standard for patients with cervical cancer. Although questions remain regarding the use of MIS radical hysterectomy for some subpopulations of good-risk patients, the data from this trial suggest that open abdominal surgery should be considered the standard of care for patients with early-stage cervical cancer who are candidates for  radical hysterectomy. Patients with stages IA2 to IB disease who desire future fertility may be candidates for radical trachelectomy.  In this procedure, the cervix and lateral parametrial tissues are removed, and the uterine body and ovaries are maintained.  Most centers use the following criteria for patient selection: Desire for future pregnancy. Age younger than 40 years. Presumed stage IA2 to IB1 disease and a lesion size no greater than 2 cm. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging that shows a margin from the most distal edge of the tumor to the lower uterine segment. Squamous, adenosquamous, or adenocarcinoma cell types. Intraoperatively, the patient is assessed in a manner similar to a radical hysterectomy; the procedure is aborted if more advanced disease than expected is encountered.  The margins of the specimen are also assessed at the time of surgery, and a radical hysterectomy is performed if inadequate margins are obtained.[5-9] Intracavitary radiation therapy is a treatment option when palliative treatment is appropriate because of  other medical conditions and for women who are not surgical candidates. If the depth of invasion is less than 3
mm, no capillary lymphatic space invasion is noted, and the frequency
of lymph-node involvement is sufficiently low, external-beam radiation therapy is
not required.  One or two  insertions with tandem and ovoids for 6,500 mg to 8,000
mg hours (100–125 Gy vaginal surface dose) are recommended.[10] Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

Radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without total pelvic radiation therapy plus chemotherapy. Radical trachelectomy. Radiation therapy alone. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (under clinical evaluation). IMRT (under clinical evaluation). The size of the tumor is an important prognostic factor and should be carefully evaluated in choosing optimal therapy.[1] Either radiation therapy or radical hysterectomy and bilateral lymph–node
dissection results in cure rates of 85% to 90%
for women with Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) stages IA2 and IB1 small-volume disease.  The choice of either treatment depends on
patient factors and available local expertise.  A randomized trial reported
identical 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates when comparing
radiation therapy with radical hysterectomy.[2] In stage IB2, for tumors that expand the cervix more than 4
cm, the primary treatment should be concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy.[3] Concurrent, cisplatin-based chemotherapy with radiation therapy is the standard of care for women who require radiation
therapy for treatment of cervical cancer.[4-10] Radiation therapy protocols for patients with cervical cancer have historically used dosing at two anatomical points, termed point A and point B, to standardize the doses received.  Point A is defined as 2 cm from the external os, and 2 cm lateral, relative to the endocervical canal.   Point B is also 2 cm from the external os, and 5 cm lateral from the patient midline, relative to the bony pelvis.  In general, for smaller tumors, the curative-intent dose for point A is around 70 Gy, whereas for larger tumors, the  point A dose may approach 90 Gy. Evidence (radiation with concomitant chemotherapy): Three randomized phase III trials have shown an OS advantage for
cisplatin-based therapy given concurrently with radiation therapy,[4-7] while
one trial that examined this regimen demonstrated no benefit.[8]  The patient
populations in these studies included women with FIGO stages IB2 to IVA
cervical cancer treated with primary radiation therapy, and women with FIGO
stages I to IIA disease who, at the time of primary surgery, were  found to have poor prognostic factors, including  metastatic disease in pelvic lymph nodes, parametrial disease, and positive surgical margins.Although the positive trials vary
somewhat in terms of the stage of disease, dose of radiation, and schedule of
cisplatin and radiation, the trials  demonstrate significant survival benefit for
this combined approach.The risk of death from cervical cancer was decreased
by 30% to 50% with the use of  concurrent chemoradiation therapy.Other trials have confirmed these findings.[9,10] Although the positive trials vary

cisplatin and radiation, the trials  demonstrate significant survival benefit for
this combined approach. The risk of death from cervical cancer was decreased
by 30% to 50% with the use of  concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Other trials have confirmed these findings.[9,10] Standard radiation therapy for cervical cancer includes brachytherapy after  external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Although low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy, typically with cesium Cs 137 (137Cs), has been the traditional approach, the use of high-dose rate (HDR) therapy, typically with iridium Ir 192, is rapidly increasing. HDR brachytherapy has the advantages of eliminating radiation exposure to medical personnel, a shorter treatment time, patient convenience, and improved outpatient management. The American Brachytherapy Society has published guidelines for the use of LDR and HDR brachytherapy as components of cervical cancer treatment.[11,12] Evidence (brachytherapy): In three randomized trials, HDR brachytherapy was comparable with LDR brachytherapy in terms of local-regional control and complication rates.[13-15][Level of evidence B1]Surgery after radiation therapy may be indicated for some patients with tumors confined to the cervix that respond incompletely to radiation therapy or for patients whose  vaginal anatomy precludes optimal brachytherapy.[16] Surgery after radiation therapy may be indicated for some patients with tumors confined to the cervix that respond incompletely to radiation therapy or for patients whose  vaginal anatomy precludes optimal brachytherapy.[16] The resection of macroscopically involved pelvic nodes may
improve rates of local control with postoperative  radiation therapy.[17] Patients who underwent
extraperitoneal lymph–node sampling had fewer bowel complications than those
who had transperitoneal lymph–node sampling.[18-20]  Patients with close
vaginal margins (<0.5 cm) may also benefit from pelvic radiation therapy.[21] Radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy may be considered for women with stages IB to IIA disease. Evidence (radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without total pelvic radiation therapy plus chemotherapy): An Italian group randomly assigned 343 women with stage IB and IIA cervical cancer to surgery or radiation therapy. The radiation therapy included EBRT and one 137Cs LDR insertion, with a total dose to point A from 70 to 90 Gy (median 76 Gy).   Patients in the surgery arm underwent a class III radical hysterectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy, and selective, para-aortic lymph–node dissection.  Adjuvant radiation therapy was given to patients with high-risk pathological features in the uterine specimen or positive lymph nodes.  Adjuvant radiation therapy was EBRT to a total dose of 50.4 Gy over 5 to 6 weeks.[2][Level of evidence A1] The primary outcome was OS at 5 years, with secondary measures of rate of recurrence and complications.  With a median follow-up of 87 months, the OS rate was the same in both groups at 83% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI],  0.7–2.3; P = .8).  Complications were highest among the patients who received adjuvant radiation after surgery.In general, radical hysterectomy should be avoided in patients who are likely to require adjuvant therapy.

Of 631 eligible patients, 319 were assigned to MIS and 312 to open surgery.The DFS rate at 4.5 years was 86% for the MIS group and 96.5% for the open group, a difference of 10.6 percentage points (95% CI,  -16.4 to -4.7).  At 3 years, the MIS group had a DFS rate of 91.2% versus 97.1% for the open surgery group (HR for disease recurrence or death, 3.74; 95% CI,  1.63–8.58).  The MIS group also had a lower OS rate at 3 years (OS,  93.8% vs. 99.0% for the open surgery group; HR for death from any cause, 6.0;  95% CI, 1.77– 20.30).[22][Level of evidence A1]  The study concluded that MIS was inferior to an open abdominal approach and should not replace open surgery as the standard for cervical cancer patients.

Although questions remain regarding the use of MIS radical hysterectomy for some subpopulations of good-risk patients, the data from this trial suggest that open abdominal surgery should be considered the standard of care for patients with early-stage cervical cancer who are candidates for  radical hysterectomy. Based on recurrence rates in clinical trials, two classes of recurrence risk have been defined.  Patients with a combination of large tumor size, lymph vascular space invasion, and deep stromal invasion in the hysterectomy specimen are deemed to have intermediate-risk disease. These patients are candidates for adjuvant EBRT.[24]  Patients whose pathology shows positive margins, positive parametria, or positive lymph nodes are  high-risk candidates for recurrence. Evidence (adjuvant radiation therapy postsurgery): The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) compared adjuvant radiation therapy alone with radiation therapy plus cisplatin plus fluorouracil (5-FU) after radical hysterectomy for patients in the high-risk group.  Postoperative patients were eligible if their pathology showed any one of the following: positive parametria, positive margins, or positive lymph nodes.  Patients in both arms received 49 Gy to the pelvis. Patients in the experimental arm also received cisplatin (70 mg/m2) and a 96-hour infusion of 5-FU (1,000 mg/m2/d every 3 weeks for four cycles); the first two cycles were concurrent with the radiation therapy.[6][Level of evidence A1]   There were 268 patients evaluated with a primary end point of OS. The study results were  reported early because of the positive results in other trials of concomitant cisplatin and radiation therapy.The estimated 4-year survival rate was 81% for chemotherapy plus radiation therapy and 71% for radiation therapy alone (HR, 1.96; P = .007).As expected, grade 4 toxicity was more common in the chemotherapy plus radiation therapy group, with hematologic toxicity predominating. There were 268 patients evaluated with a primary end point of OS. The study results were  reported early because of the positive results in other trials of concomitant cisplatin and radiation therapy. The estimated 4-year survival rate was 81% for chemotherapy plus radiation therapy and 71% for radiation therapy alone (HR, 1.96; P = .007). As expected, grade 4 toxicity was more common in the chemotherapy plus radiation therapy group, with hematologic toxicity predominating. Radical surgery has been performed for small lesions, but the high incidence of pathological factors leading to postoperative radiation with or without chemotherapy make primary concomitant chemotherapy and radiation a more common approach in patients with larger tumors. Radiation in the range of
50 Gy administered for  5 weeks plus chemotherapy with cisplatin with or without
5-FU should be considered in patients with a  high risk of recurrence. After
surgical staging, patients found to have small-volume para-aortic nodal disease
and controllable pelvic disease may be cured with pelvic and para-aortic
radiation therapy.[25]  Treatment of patients with unresected para-aortic nodes with extended-field radiation therapy and chemotherapy leads to
long-term disease control in patients with low-volume (<2 cm) nodal
disease below L3.[18]  A single study (RTOG-7920) showed a survival advantage in patients
with tumors larger than 4 cm who received radiation therapy to para-aortic
nodes without histological evidence of disease.[26]  Toxic effects were greater with para-aortic
radiation therapy than with pelvic radiation therapy alone but were mostly confined to
patients with previous  abdominopelvic surgery.[26] The use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) may minimize the effects  to the small bowel usually associated with this treatment.[27] Patients with presumed early-stage disease who desire future fertility may be candidates for radical trachelectomy.  In this procedure, the cervix and lateral parametrial tissues are removed, and the uterine body and ovaries are maintained.  The patient selection differs somewhat between groups; however, general criteria include the following: Desire for future pregnancy. Age younger than 40 years. Presumed stage IA2 to IB1 disease and a lesion size no greater than 2 cm. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging that shows a margin from the most distal edge of the tumor to the lower uterine segment. Squamous, adenosquamous, or adenocarcinoma cell types. Intraoperatively, the patient is assessed in a manner similar to a radical hysterectomy; the procedure is aborted if more advanced disease than expected is encountered.  The margins of the specimen are also assessed at the time of surgery, and a radical hysterectomy is performed if inadequate margins are obtained.[28-32] External-beam pelvic radiation therapy combined with two  or more
intracavitary brachytherapy applications is appropriate therapy for patients with stage IA2 and IB1 lesions. For patients with stage IB2 and larger lesions, radiosensitizing chemotherapy is indicated. The role of radiosensitizing chemotherapy in patients with stage IA2 and IB1 lesions is untested. However, it may prove beneficial in certain cases. Several groups have investigated the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to convert patients who are conventional candidates for chemoradiation into candidates for radical surgery.[33-37]   Multiple regimens have been used; however, almost all use a platinum backbone.  The largest randomized trial to date  was reported in 2001, and its accrual was completed before the standard of care included the addition of cisplatin to radiation therapy.[38]  As a result, the control arm received radiation therapy alone. Although there was an improvement in OS for the experimental arm, the results do not reflect current practice.  This study accrued patients with stages IB through IVA disease, but improvement in the experimental arm was only noted for participants with early-stage disease (stages IB, IIA, or IIB). EORTC-55994 (NCT00039338)  randomly assigned patients with stages IB2, IIA2, and IIB cervical cancer to standard chemoradiation or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (with a cisplatin backbone for three cycles) followed by evaluation for surgery.  With OS as the primary end point, this trial may delineate whether there is a role for neoadjuvant chemotherapy for this patient population. IMRT is a radiation therapy technique that allows for conformal dosing of target anatomy while sparing neighboring tissue. Theoretically, this technique should decrease radiation therapy–related toxicity, but this could come at the cost of decreased efficacy if tissue is inappropriately excluded from the treatment field.  Several institutions have reported their experience with IMRT for postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk disease after radical surgery.[39-41]   A Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) phase II trial (RTOG-0418 [NCT00331760]) evaluated the use of IMRT in patients with both cervical and endometrial cancers who require adjuvant radiation therapy.

carefully evaluated in choosing optimal therapy.[1] Survival and local control
are better with unilateral rather than bilateral parametrial involvement.[2] Patterns-of-care studies
in stages IIIA and IIIB patients indicate that survival is dependent on the extent
of the disease, with unilateral pelvic wall involvement predicting a better
outcome than bilateral involvement, which in turn predicts a better outcome
than involvement of the lower third of the vaginal wall.[2]  These studies also
reveal a progressive increase in local control and survival paralleling a
progressive increase in paracentral (point A) dose and use of intracavitary
treatment.  The highest rate of central control was seen with paracentral
(point A) doses of  more than 85 Gy.[3] Treatment options for stage IIB, stage III, and stage IVA cervical cancer include the following: Radiation therapy with concomitant chemotherapy. [4] Interstitial brachytherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Strong
consideration should be given to the use of intracavitary radiation therapy and external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the pelvis combined with cisplatin or cisplatin/fluorouracil  (5-FU).[5-12] Evidence (radiation therapy with concomitant chemotherapy): Five randomized phase III trials  have shown an overall survival  (OS) advantage for
cisplatin-based therapy given concurrently with radiation therapy,[5-10] but 
one trial that examined this regimen demonstrated no benefit.[13]  The patient
populations in these studies included women with Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) stages IB2 to IVA
cervical cancer treated with primary radiation therapy, and women with FIGO
stages I to IIA disease who, at the time of primary surgery, were  found to have poor prognostic factors, including metastatic disease in pelvic lymph nodes, parametrial disease, and positive surgical margins.  Although the positive trials vary
somewhat in terms of the stage of disease, dose of radiation, and schedule of
cisplatin and radiation, the trials  demonstrate significant survival benefit for
this combined approach.The risk of death from cervical cancer was decreased
by 30% to 50% with the use of  concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Although the positive trials vary
somewhat in terms of the stage of disease, dose of radiation, and schedule of
cisplatin and radiation, the trials  demonstrate significant survival benefit for
this combined approach. The risk of death from cervical cancer was decreased
by 30% to 50% with the use of  concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Evidence (low-dose rate vs. high-dose rate intracavitary radiation therapy): Although low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy, typically with cesium Cs 137, has been the traditional approach, the use of high-dose rate (HDR) therapy, typically with iridium Ir 192, is rapidly increasing. HDR brachytherapy provides the advantage of eliminating radiation exposure to medical personnel, a shorter treatment time, patient convenience, and improved outpatient management.  The American Brachytherapy Society has published guidelines for the use of LDR and HDR brachytherapy as a component of cervical cancer treatment.[14,15] In three  randomized trials, HDR brachytherapy was comparable with LDR brachytherapy in terms of local-regional control and complication rates.[16-18][Level of evidence B1] In an attempt to improve upon standard chemoradiation, a phase III randomized trial compared concurrent gemcitabine plus cisplatin and radiation therapy followed by adjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin (experimental arm) with concurrent cisplatin plus radiation (standard chemoradiation) in patients with stages IIB to IVA cervical cancer.[19][Level of evidence A1]  A total of 515 patients from nine countries were enrolled.  The schedule for the experimental arm was cisplatin (40 mg/m2) and gemcitabine (125 mg/m2) weekly for 6 weeks, with concurrent EBRT (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions) followed by brachytherapy (30–35 Gy in 96 hours) and then two adjuvant 21-day cycles of cisplatin (50 mg/m2) on day 1 plus gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2) on days 1 and 8.  The standard arm was cisplatin (40 mg/m2) weekly for 6 weeks with concurrent EBRT  and brachytherapy as described for the experimental arm.The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 3 years; however, the study found improvement in the experimental arm for PFS at 3 years (74.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 68%–79.8% vs. 65.0%; 95% CI, 58.5%–70.7%); overall PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49–0.95); and OS (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49–0.95).  Patients in the experimental arm had increased hematologic and nonhematologic grade 3 or 4 toxic effects, and two deaths in the experimental arm were possibly related to treatment. A subgroup analysis showed an increased benefit in patients with a higher stage of disease (stages III–IVA vs. stage IIB), which suggested  that the increased toxic effects of the experimental protocol may be justified for these patients.[20] Additional investigation is needed to determine which aspect of the experimental arm led to improved survival (i.e., the addition of the weekly gemcitabine, the adjuvant chemotherapy, or both) and to determine quality of life during and after treatment, a  condition  that  was omitted from the protocol. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 3 years; however, the study found improvement in the experimental arm for PFS at 3 years (74.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 68%–79.8% vs. 65.0%; 95% CI, 58.5%–70.7%); overall PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49–0.95); and OS (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49–0.95).  Patients in the experimental arm had increased hematologic and nonhematologic grade 3 or 4 toxic effects, and two deaths in the experimental arm were possibly related to treatment. A subgroup analysis showed an increased benefit in patients with a higher stage of disease (stages III–IVA vs. stage IIB), which suggested  that the increased toxic effects of the experimental protocol may be justified for these patients.[20] Additional investigation is needed to determine which aspect of the experimental arm led to improved survival (i.e., the addition of the weekly gemcitabine, the adjuvant chemotherapy, or both) and to determine quality of life during and after treatment, a  condition  that  was omitted from the protocol. For patients who complete EBRT and have bulky cervical disease such that standard brachytherapy cannot be placed anatomically, interstitial brachytherapy has been used to deliver adequate tumoricidal doses with an acceptable toxicity profile.[21] Several groups have investigated the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to convert patients who are conventional candidates for chemoradiation into candidates for radical surgery.[22-26]   Multiple regimens have been used; however, almost all use a platinum backbone.  The largest randomized trial to date  was reported in 2001, and its accrual was completed before the standard of care included the addition of cisplatin to radiation therapy.[27]  As a result, although there was an improvement in OS for the experimental arm, the results are not reflective of current practice.  This study accrued patients with stages IB through IVA disease, but improvement in the experimental arm was only noted for participants with early-stage disease (stages IB, IIA, or IIB). EORTC-55994 (NCT00039338) randomly assigned patients with stages IB2, IIA2, and IIB cervical cancer to standard chemoradiation or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (with a cisplatin backbone for three cycles) followed by evaluation for surgery.  With OS as the primary end point, this trial may delineate whether there is a role for neoadjuvant chemotherapy for this patient population. Patients who are surgically staged as part of a clinical trial and are found to
have small-volume para-aortic nodal disease and controllable pelvic disease may
be cured with pelvic and para-aortic radiation therapy.[28] Treatment of patients with unresected periaortic nodes with extended-field
radiation therapy leads to long-term disease control in patients with low-volume
(<2 cm) nodal disease below L3.[29]   A single study  (RTOG-7920) showed a survival advantage
in patients who received radiation therapy to para-aortic nodes without histological
evidence of disease.[30] Toxic effects are greater with para-aortic radiation than
with pelvic radiation alone but were mostly confined to patients with previous 
abdominopelvic surgery.[30] If postoperative
 EBRT is planned following surgery, extraperitoneal lymph–node
sampling is associated with fewer radiation-induced complications than a
transperitoneal approach.[31]  Patients who underwent extraperitoneal lymph–node
sampling had fewer bowel complications than those who had transperitoneal lymph–node sampling.[29,31,32] The resection of macroscopically involved pelvic
nodes may improve rates of local control with postoperative radiation
therapy.[33] In addition, prospective data points to improvement in outcomes for patients who undergo resection of positive para-aortic lymph nodes before curative intent chemoradiation therapy; however, only patients with minimal nodal involvement (<5 mm) benefited.[34] Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. General information about clinical trials is also available.

Palliative chemotherapy and other systemic therapy. Phase I and phase II clinical trials of new anticancer drugs. Radiation therapy may be used to palliate central disease or distant
metastases. Multiple agents are associated with objective response rates; however, durable responses are rare. Drugs used in stage IVB cervical cancer treatment are shown in Table 6. Single-agent cisplatin administered intravenously at 50 mg/m² every 3 weeks has been the regimen most often used to treat recurrent cervical cancer since the drug was initially introduced in the 1970s.[2] More recently, the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) has reported on sequential randomized trials dealing with combination chemotherapy for stage IVB, recurrent, or persistent cervical cancer.[8,12-16] Evidence (cisplatin in combination with other drugs): GOG-110, GOG-0179, GOG-0169:GOG-110: The ifosfamide + cisplatin combination was superior to cisplatin alone in the secondary end point of response rates, but at the cost of increased toxicity.GOG-0179: The cisplatin + topotecan (CT) doublet combination had a significant advantage in overall survival (OS) compared with cisplatin alone, leading to approval of this indication for topotecan by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, cisplatin alone underperformed in this trial because as many as 40% of the patients had already received cisplatin up front as a radiosensitizer.[12]GOG-0169: The paclitaxel + cisplatin (PC) combination, similarly, was superior in response rates and progression-free survival (PFS), and its toxicity was similar to that of the single agent except in patients with GOG performance status 2 (scale: 0, asymptomatic–4, totally bedridden).  Therefore, PC was chosen as the reference arm in GOG-0204 (NCT00064077). GOG-0204 enrolled 513 patients and compared four cisplatin-based doublet regimens.  The trial was closed early because no one experimental arm was likely to significantly lower the hazard ratio (HR) of death relative to PC:[16]1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79–1.67) for vinorelbine + cisplatin (VC).1.32 (95% CI, 0.91–1.92) for gemcitabine plus cisplatin.1.27 (95% CI, 0.90–1.78) for CT. Trend in response rates, PFS, and OS favored CT.Patients in the four study arms experienced different grades of neutropenia, infection, and alopecia.[16] There were no differences in health-related quality of life during treatment.[17] However, there were more neurological side effects for PC. GOG-0240 (NCT00803062) was designed to answer the following two questions:[18]Can a nonplatinum combination show improvement over the standard of cisplatin-paclitaxel in this population, which was previously treated with cisplatin during radiation therapy?Can the addition of bevacizumab improve combination chemotherapy in patients with stages IVB, persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer?Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following four treatment arms:Cisplatin (50 mg/m2) + paclitaxel (135 mg/m2 or 175 mg/m2) on day 1 (PC).PC + bevacizumab (15mg/kg) on day 1.Topotecan (0.75 mg/m2) d1–d3 + paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) on day 1 (PT).PT + bevacizumab (15mg/kg) on day 1.Additional study methods and results included the following:The primary end point was OS, and  452 patients were evaluable.The combination PT was not superior to PC and had  a  HR for death of 1.2 (99% CI, 0.82–1.76).  Previous exposure to platinum did not affect this result.  The addition of bevacizumab to combination chemotherapy led to an improvement in OS: 17 months for chemotherapy plus bevacizumab versus 13.3 months for chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.71; 98% CI, 0.54–0.95), and extended PFS: 8.2 months for chemotherapy plus bevacizumab versus 5.9 months for chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54–0.82).  The addition of bevacizumab was well tolerated and showed no difference in quality of life between the two groups.   Patients who received bevacizumab were more likely to have grade 3 or higher fistulae (6% vs. 0%), and grade 3 or higher thromboembolic events (8% vs. 1%) compared with patients who received chemotherapy alone.As a result, the addition of bevacizumab may be considered for this patient population. GOG-110: The ifosfamide + cisplatin combination was superior to cisplatin alone in the secondary end point of response rates, but at the cost of increased toxicity. GOG-0179: The cisplatin + topotecan (CT) doublet combination had a significant advantage in overall survival (OS) compared with cisplatin alone, leading to approval of this indication for topotecan by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, cisplatin alone underperformed in this trial because as many as 40% of the patients had already received cisplatin up front as a radiosensitizer.[12] GOG-0169: The paclitaxel + cisplatin (PC) combination, similarly, was superior in response rates and progression-free survival (PFS), and its toxicity was similar to that of the single agent except in patients with GOG performance status 2 (scale: 0, asymptomatic–4, totally bedridden).  Therefore, PC was chosen as the reference arm in GOG-0204 (NCT00064077). 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79–1.67) for vinorelbine + cisplatin (VC). 1.32 (95% CI, 0.91–1.92) for gemcitabine plus cisplatin. 1.27 (95% CI, 0.90–1.78) for CT. Trend in response rates, PFS, and OS favored CT. Patients in the four study arms experienced different grades of neutropenia, infection, and alopecia.[16] There were no differences in health-related quality of life during treatment.[17] However, there were more neurological side effects for PC. Can a nonplatinum combination show improvement over the standard of cisplatin-paclitaxel in this population, which was previously treated with cisplatin during radiation therapy? Can the addition of bevacizumab improve combination chemotherapy in patients with stages IVB, persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer? Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following four treatment arms: Cisplatin (50 mg/m2) + paclitaxel (135 mg/m2 or 175 mg/m2) on day 1 (PC). PC + bevacizumab (15mg/kg) on day 1. Topotecan (0.75 mg/m2) d1–d3 + paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) on day 1 (PT). PT + bevacizumab (15mg/kg) on day 1. Additional study methods and results included the following: The primary end point was OS, and  452 patients were evaluable. The combination PT was not superior to PC and had  a  HR for death of 1.2 (99% CI, 0.82–1.76).  Previous exposure to platinum did not affect this result. The addition of bevacizumab to combination chemotherapy led to an improvement in OS: 17 months for chemotherapy plus bevacizumab versus 13.3 months for chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.71; 98% CI, 0.54–0.95), and extended PFS: 8.2 months for chemotherapy plus bevacizumab versus 5.9 months for chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54–0.82). The addition of bevacizumab was well tolerated and showed no difference in quality of life between the two groups. Patients who received bevacizumab were more likely to have grade 3 or higher fistulae (6% vs. 0%), and grade 3 or higher thromboembolic events (8% vs. 1%) compared with patients who received chemotherapy alone. As a result, the addition of bevacizumab may be considered for this patient population.

Treatment options for recurrent cervical cancer include the following: Immunotherapy. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Palliative chemotherapy and other systemic therapy. Pelvic exenteration. Phase I and phase II clinical trials of new anticancer drugs. Favorable experience with the anti–programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, has led to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval based on the phase II  KEYNOTE-158 trial (NCT02628067) for women with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer whose tumors express programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) (combined positive score [CPS], ≥1). KEYNOTE-028 (NCT02054806) was an earlier phase 1b expansion cohort of the anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab that included 24 patients, all but 1 with squamous cell carcinoma.[1] The overall response rate was 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5%–37%), with 4 patients achieving a confirmed partial response.Treatment-related adverse events that were  considered to be related to the study drug were observed in 18 patients, with only rash (n = 5; 21%) and pyrexia (n = 4; 17%) occurring in 10% or more of the patients. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were experienced by 5 patients and included neutropenia, rash, colitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and proteinuria. The phase II findings in the preliminary analysis of 47 patients that led to the FDA approval of pembrolizumab were presented in abstract form;[2] these have been updated in Keytruda’s package insert. KEYNOTE-158 (NCT02628067) was a multicenter, nonrandomized trial that entered 98 patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who received 200 mg every 3 weeks intravenously until there was unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.[3] A separate analysis was performed in 77 patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS ≥1); 92% had squamous histology. The overall response rate among PD-L1–positive patients was 16% (95% CI, 8.8%–25.9%) with 3 complete responses and 10 partial responses; 17 patients were stable. Median progression-free survival  (PFS) was 2.1 months, and overall survival  (OS) was 9.4 months in these marker-positive patients. Treatment-related adverse events were noted in 65% of patients; the most common were hypothyroidism (10.2%), decreased appetite (9.2%), fatigue (9.2%), and diarrhea 8.2%.[3][Level of evidence B4] The experience in a case series of 11 patients that showed 2 patients with  partial responses  and 2 patients with disease stabilization associated with pembrolizumab treatment has been published.[4] In the CheckMate 358 trial (NCT02488759), presented in abstract form, nivolumab (240 mg IV q 2 weeks) was tested in 19 patients with cervical cancer and 5 patients with other virus-associated tumors of vaginal and vulvar origins.[5]One complete and four partial responses were noted among the patients with cervical cancer.The median PFS was 5.5 months. KEYNOTE-826 (NCT03635567) was a multicenter, phase III, randomized trial that included 617 women with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer not previously treated with systemic chemotherapy. Patients had measurable disease. All women were treated with cisplatin or carboplatin combined with paclitaxel, with the option to add bevacizumab. Patients were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab or placebo. The dual primary end points were PFS and OS.[6] Final overall results were presented in abstract form.[7]		The OS for all women was 26.4 months for patients who received pembrolizumab and 16.8 months for patients who received placebo (P < .0001), and was also similar in subgroups of women with a PD-L1 CPS of ≥1 or ≥10.[7][Level of evidence A1]After a median follow-up of 39 months, the median PFS for all women was 10.3 months for patients who received pembrolizumab and 8.2 months for patients who received the placebo (P < .0001). The benefit was similar in subgroups of women with a PD-L1 CPS of ≥1 or ≥10.[7]	There was no difference in quality-of-life metrics between the pembrolizumab and placebo groups.[8] The overall response rate was 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5%–37%), with 4 patients achieving a confirmed partial response. Treatment-related adverse events that were  considered to be related to the study drug were observed in 18 patients, with only rash (n = 5; 21%) and pyrexia (n = 4; 17%) occurring in 10% or more of the patients. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were experienced by 5 patients and included neutropenia, rash, colitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and proteinuria. The phase II findings in the preliminary analysis of 47 patients that led to the FDA approval of pembrolizumab were presented in abstract form;[2] these have been updated in Keytruda’s package insert.

The median PFS was 5.5 months. The OS for all women was 26.4 months for patients who received pembrolizumab and 16.8 months for patients who received placebo (P < .0001), and was also similar in subgroups of women with a PD-L1 CPS of ≥1 or ≥10.[7][Level of evidence A1] After a median follow-up of 39 months, the median PFS for all women was 10.3 months for patients who received pembrolizumab and 8.2 months for patients who received the placebo (P < .0001). The benefit was similar in subgroups of women with a PD-L1 CPS of ≥1 or ≥10.[7] There was no difference in quality-of-life metrics between the pembrolizumab and placebo groups.[8] Radiation therapy and chemotherapy (fluorouracil with or without mitomycin) may cure
40% to 50% of patients with recurrence in the pelvis after initial radical surgery.[9] Chemotherapy can be used for palliation.  Drugs used for palliative chemotherapy are shown in Table 7. Single-agent cisplatin administered intravenously at 50 mg/m² every 3 weeks has been the regimen most often used to treat recurrent cervical cancer since the drug was initially introduced in the 1970s.[10] More recently, the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) has reported on sequential randomized trials dealing with combination chemotherapy for stage IVB, recurrent, or persistent cervical cancer.[17,20,22-25] Evidence (cisplatin in combination with other drugs): GOG-110, GOG-0179, GOG-0169 (NCT00803062)GOG-110: The ifosfamide + cisplatin combination was superior to cisplatin alone in the secondary end point of response rates, but at the cost of increased toxicity.GOG-0179: The cisplatin + topotecan (CT) doublet combination had a significant advantage in OS compared with cisplatin alone, leading to approval of this indication for topotecan by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, cisplatin alone underperformed in this trial because as many as 40% of the patients had already received cisplatin up front as a radiosensitizer.[20]GOG-0169: The paclitaxel + cisplatin (PC) combination, similarly, was superior in response rates and PFS, and its toxicity was similar to that of the single agent except in patients with GOG performance status 2 (scale: 0, asymptomatic–4, totally bedridden).  Therefore, PC was chosen as the reference arm in GOG-0204 (NCT00064077). GOG-0204 enrolled 513 patients and compared four cisplatin-based doublet regimens.  The trial was closed early because no one experimental arm was likely to significantly lower the hazard ratio of death relative to PC:[25]1.15 (95% CI, 0.79–1.67) for vinorelbine + cisplatin (VC).1.32 (95% CI, 0.91–1.92) for gemcitabine plus cisplatin.1.27 (95% CI, 0.90–1.78) for CT. Trends in response rate, PFS, and OS favored CT.Patients in the four study arms experienced different grades of  neutropenia, infection, and alopecia.[25] There were no differences in health-related quality of life during treatment.[26] However, there were more neurological side effects for PC. GOG-0240 (NCT00803062) was designed to answer the following two questions:[27]Can a nonplatinum combination show improvement over the standard of cisplatin-paclitaxel in this population previously treated with cisplatin during radiation therapy?Can the addition of bevacizumab improve upon combination chemotherapy in patients with stage IVB, persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer?Patients were randomly assigned to the following four treatment arms:Cisplatin (50 mg/m2) + paclitaxel (135 mg/m2 or 175 mg/m2) on day 1 (PC).PC + bevacizumab (15mg/kg) on day 1.Topotecan (0.75 mg/m2) d1–d3 + paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) on day 1 (PT).PT + bevacizumab (15mg/kg) on day 1.Additional study methods and results included the following:The primary end point was OS, and 452 patients were evaluable.  The combination PT was not superior to PC and had  a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 1.2 (99% CI, 0.82–1.76).  Previous exposure to platinum did not affect this result.  The addition of bevacizumab to combination chemotherapy led to an improvement in OS: 17 months for chemotherapy plus bevacizumab versus 13.3 months for chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.71; 98% CI, 0.54–0.95), and extended PFS: 8.2 months for chemotherapy plus bevacizumab versus 5.9 months for chemotherapy alone, HR, 0.67; (95% CI, 0.54–0.82).  The addition of bevacizumab was well tolerated and showed no difference in quality of life between the two groups.   Patients who received bevacizumab were more likely to have grade 3 or higher fistulae (6% vs. 0%) and grade 3 or higher thromboembolic events (8% vs. 1%) compared with patients on chemotherapy alone. As a result, the addition of bevacizumab may be considered for this patient population. GOG-110: The ifosfamide + cisplatin combination was superior to cisplatin alone in the secondary end point of response rates, but at the cost of increased toxicity. GOG-0179: The cisplatin + topotecan (CT) doublet combination had a significant advantage in OS compared with cisplatin alone, leading to approval of this indication for topotecan by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Therefore, PC was chosen as the reference arm in GOG-0204 (NCT00064077). 1.15 (95% CI, 0.79–1.67) for vinorelbine + cisplatin (VC). 1.32 (95% CI, 0.91–1.92) for gemcitabine plus cisplatin. 1.27 (95% CI, 0.90–1.78) for CT. Trends in response rate, PFS, and OS favored CT. Patients in the four study arms experienced different grades of  neutropenia, infection, and alopecia.[25] There were no differences in health-related quality of life during treatment.[26] However, there were more neurological side effects for PC. Can a nonplatinum combination show improvement over the standard of cisplatin-paclitaxel in this population previously treated with cisplatin during radiation therapy? Can the addition of bevacizumab improve upon combination chemotherapy in patients with stage IVB, persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer? Patients were randomly assigned to the following four treatment arms: Cisplatin (50 mg/m2) + paclitaxel (135 mg/m2 or 175 mg/m2) on day 1 (PC). PC + bevacizumab (15mg/kg) on day 1. Topotecan (0.75 mg/m2) d1–d3 + paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) on day 1 (PT). PT + bevacizumab (15mg/kg) on day 1. Additional study methods and results included the following: The primary end point was OS, and 452 patients were evaluable. The combination PT was not superior to PC and had  a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 1.2 (99% CI, 0.82–1.76).  Previous exposure to platinum did not affect this result.

The addition of bevacizumab was well tolerated and showed no difference in quality of life between the two groups. Patients who received bevacizumab were more likely to have grade 3 or higher fistulae (6% vs. 0%) and grade 3 or higher thromboembolic events (8% vs. 1%) compared with patients on chemotherapy alone. As a result, the addition of bevacizumab may be considered for this patient population. No standard treatment is available for patients with  recurrent cervical cancer that has spread
beyond the confines of a radiation or surgical field.   For locally recurrent disease, pelvic exenteration can lead
to a 5-year survival rate of 32% to 62% in selected patients.[28,29] These patients are
appropriate candidates for clinical trials testing drug combinations or new
anticancer agents. Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

Diagnosis Treatment of Stage I Disease Treatment of Stages II, III, and IV Disease Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy During pregnancy, no therapy is warranted for preinvasive lesions of the
cervix, including carcinoma in situ, although expert colposcopy is recommended
to exclude invasive cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer in pregnancy is predicated on the extent of disease and the gestational age at diagnosis.   Patients should undergo biopsy as needed and  imaging  to establish the extent of disease  to make the most informed choices.   The most appropriate imaging modality in pregnancy is magnetic resonance imaging, when indicated. Pregnancy does not alter the course of cervical cancer.  As a result, in certain cases, patients may elect to postpone treatment until its effects on the pregnancy are minimized.  This may be considered for patients with the more common and less aggressive histological subtypes: squamous, adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous.  Patients with high-risk subtypes, such as small cell or neuroendocrine tumors, should be counseled toward immediate treatment despite the effects on the fetus, given their risk of progression. Patients with early stage (IA) disease may safely undergo fertility-sparing treatments, including cervical conization or radical trachelectomy, as indicated.  The optimal timing for this procedure is in the second trimester, before fetal viability.  Some authors have suggested waiting until the completion of a pregnancy to initiate treatment.[1]  For patients with IA2 and IB disease, such a delay may also be safe, but because of  a risk of lymphatic spread, assessment of lymph-node status should first be ascertained.  The status  is best determined surgically via a laparoscopic or open lymph-node dissection, which can be safely performed up to approximately 20 weeks of pregnancy.[2,3] In patients without lymphatic spread, waiting for fetal viability to initiate treatment is an option.  Patients with positive lymph nodes should be counseled toward immediate treatment. For patients with stage II or greater disease, waiting for fetal viability is generally not acceptable.[4] The standard of care is curative intent chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  This treatment is toxic to the fetus and, without ovarian transposition, will render the ovaries nonfunctional after treatment.  Evacuation of the fetus should be performed before radiation is initiated.  When this is not possible, the radiation will generally cause a spontaneous abortion 3 to 5 weeks after initiating treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been offered to patients with locally advanced disease as a way to initiate treatment while maintaining the pregnancy.[1]  Most chemotherapy agents can be initiated safely in the second trimester of pregnancy and beyond;  mild growth restriction of the fetus is the most common side effect. Restriction of growth  has been reported in a relatively small number of patients, and data are lacking on long-term outcomes for these women. As a result, this strategy should be considered with caution.   Most of the patients in the reports underwent standard treatment (either surgery or radiation therapy) after completion of the pregnancy.

d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  2014  NIH study finds regular aspirin use may reduce ovarian cancer risk   News Releases   Posted:
February 6, 2014  240-760-6600 Women who take aspirin daily may reduce their risk of ovarian cancer by 20 percent, according to a study by scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health. However, further research is needed before clinical recommendations can be made. The study was published Feb. 6, 2014, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. It is estimated that over 20,000 women in the United States will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2014, and more than 14,000 will die from the disease. Early stage ovarian cancer may be successfully treated. However, symptoms associated with this disease can mimic more common conditions, such as digestive and bladder disorders, so for this reason and others, it is often not diagnosed until it has reached advanced stages. Late stage ovarian cancer leaves women with limited treatment options and poor prognoses, making preventive strategies potentially important for controlling this disease. Chronic or persistent inflammation has been shown to increase the risk of cancer and other diseases. Previous studies have suggested that the anti-inflammatory properties of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), may reduce cancer risk overall. However, studies examining whether use of these agents may influence ovarian cancer risk have been largely inconclusive. This is the largest study to date to assess the relationship between these drugs and ovarian cancer risk. Britton Trabert, Ph.D., and Nicolas Wentzensen, M.D., Ph.D., of NCI’s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, and their colleagues, analyzed data pooled from 12 large epidemiological studies to investigate whether women who used aspirin, non-aspirin NSAIDs, or acetaminophen have a lower risk of ovarian cancer. These 12 studies (nine from the United States) were part of the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. The scientists evaluated the benefit of these drugs in nearly 8,000 women with ovarian cancer and close to 12,000 women who did not have the disease. Among study participants who reported whether or not they used aspirin regularly: 18 percent used aspirin, 24 percent used non-aspirin NSAIDs, and 16 percent used acetaminophen. The researchers determined that participants who reported daily aspirin use had a 20 percent lower risk of ovarian cancer than those who used aspirin less than once per week. For non-aspirin NSAIDs, which include a wide variety of drugs, the picture was less clear: the scientists observed a 10 percent lower ovarian cancer risk among women who used NSAIDs at least once per week compared with those who used NSAIDs less frequently. However, this finding did not fall in a range that was significant statistically. In contrast to the findings for aspirin and NSAIDs, use of acetaminophen, which is not an anti-inflammatory agent, was not associated with reduced ovarian cancer risk. This study adds to a growing list of malignancies, such as colorectal and other cancers, that appear to be potentially preventable by aspirin usage. “Our study suggests that aspirin regimens, proven to protect against heart attack, may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer as well. However intriguing our results are, they should not influence current clinical practice. Additional studies are needed to explore the delicate balance of risk-benefit for this potential chemopreventive agent, as well as studies to identify the mechanism by which aspirin may reduce ovarian cancer risk,” said Trabert. Adverse side effects of daily aspirin use include upper gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke. Therefore, a daily aspirin regimen should only be undertaken with a doctor’s approval, caution the scientists. # # #  Reference: B Trabert, et al.

Paraganglioma forms in nerve tissue  near the carotid artery, along nerve pathways in the head and neck, and in other parts of the body. Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). Inheriting certain gene mutations (changes) increases the risk of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Signs and symptoms of pheochromocytoma and  paraganglioma occur if  too much adrenaline or noradrenaline is released into the blood. Tests and procedures used to diagnose and stage pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma depend on the patient's signs and symptoms and family history. Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Pheochromocytoma forms in the adrenal gland. There are two adrenal glands, one on top of each kidney in the back of the upper abdomen. Each adrenal gland has two parts. The outer layer of the adrenal gland is the adrenal cortex. The center of the adrenal gland is the adrenal medulla. Pheochromocytoma is a tumor of the adrenal medulla.EnlargeAnatomy of the adrenal gland. There are two adrenal glands, one on top of each kidney. The outer part of each gland is the adrenal cortex and the inner part is the adrenal medulla. The adrenal glands make important hormones  called catecholamines. Adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) are two types of catecholamines that help control heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and the way the body reacts to stress. Some pheochromocytomas release extra adrenaline and noradrenaline into the blood and cause symptoms. Some paragangliomas make extra catecholamines called adrenaline and noradrenaline. The release of extra adrenaline and noradrenaline into the blood may cause symptoms.EnlargeA paraganglioma is a rare tumor that often forms in nerve tissue near the carotid artery. It may also form along nerve pathways in the head and neck and in other parts of the body. About half of all children with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma have malignant 
pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. This means that the tumor cells have spread to other parts of the body. Benign and malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma require treatment because they can cause severe or life-threatening heart problems and affect many body functions. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk. Having any of the following inherited syndromes or gene changes increases risk of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome (tumors in the parathyroid gland, pituitary gland, or islet cells in the pancreas, and rarely, pheochromocytoma). Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A syndrome (pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid cancer, and parathyroid gland disease). Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B syndrome (pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid cancer, parathyroid hyperplasia, and other conditions). von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) (pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, hemangioblastoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and other conditions). Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) (neurofibromas, brain tumors, pheochromocytoma, and other conditions). Carney-Stratakis dyad (paraganglioma and gastrointestinal stromal tumor [GIST]). Carney triad (paraganglioma, GIST, and pulmonary chondroma). Familial pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. More than half of the children and adolescents diagnosed with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma have an inherited syndrome  or gene change that increases the risk of cancer. Genetic counseling (a discussion with a trained professional about inherited diseases) and testing is an important part of the treatment plan. Some tumors do not make extra adrenaline or noradrenaline and do not cause symptoms. These tumors may be found when a lump forms in the neck or when a test is done for another reason. Signs and symptoms of pheochromocytoma and  paraganglioma occur when  too much adrenaline or noradrenaline is released into the blood.  These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, or other conditions. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following: High blood pressure. Headache. Heavy sweating for no known reason. A strong, fast, or irregular heartbeat. Feeling shaky. Being extremely pale. Dizziness. Being irritable or nervous. These signs and symptoms may come and go, but high blood pressure is more likely to occur for long periods of time in  young patients. These signs and symptoms may also occur with physical activity, injury, anesthesia, surgery to remove the tumor, eating foods such as chocolate and cheese, or while passing urine (if the tumor is in the bladder). Tests are done to diagnose and stage cancer. After cancer is diagnosed, more tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body. This process is called staging. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and health history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Plasma-free metanephrines test: A blood test that  measures the amount of metanephrines in the blood.    Metanephrines are substances that are made when the body breaks down adrenaline or noradrenaline. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas can make large amounts of adrenaline and noradrenaline and cause  high levels of metanephrines in both the blood and urine. Blood catecholamine  studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of certain catecholamines (adrenaline or noradrenaline) released into the blood. Substances caused by the breakdown of these catecholamines are also measured. An unusual (unusual higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. Higher than normal amounts may be a sign of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Twenty-four-hour urine test: A test in which urine is collected for 24 hours to measure the amounts of catecholamines (adrenaline or noradrenaline) or metanephrines in the urine. Substances caused by the breakdown of these catecholamines are also  measured. An unusual (higher than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. Higher than normal amounts may be a sign of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. PET scan: A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.EnlargePositron emission tomography (PET) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the PET scanner. The head rest and white strap help the child lie still.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the child's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body.  Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.EnlargeComputed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).EnlargeMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged. MIBG scan: A procedure used to find  neuroendocrine tumors, such as pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. A very small amount of a substance called radioactive MIBG is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  Neuroendocrine tumor cells take up the radioactive MIBG and are detected by a  scanner. Scans may be taken over 1-3 days. An iodine solution may be given before or during the test to keep the thyroid gland from absorbing too much of the MIBG. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy: A type of radionuclide scan that may be used to find tumors. A very small amount of radioactive octreotide (a hormone that attaches to tumors) is injected into a vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive octreotide attaches to the tumor and a special camera that detects radioactivity is used to show where the tumors are in the body. This procedure is also called octreotide scan and SRS. Genetic testing: A laboratory test in which cells or tissue are analyzed to look for changes in genes or chromosomes. These changes may be a sign that a person has or is at risk of having a specific disease or condition. The following are genes that might be tested for in children with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma: VHL, NF1, RET, SDHD, SDHB, SDHA, MAX, and TMEM127 genes. Prognosis and treatment options depend on the following: Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back). After pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. The process used to find out if cancer has spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body is called staging. There is no standard staging system for childhood pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. The results of the tests and procedures done to diagnose cancer are used to help make decisions about treatment. Sometimes childhood pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma recurs (comes back) after treatment. It may come back in the place it first formed or in other parts of the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  pheochromocytoma spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually pheochromocytoma cells. The disease is metastatic pheochromocytoma, not bone cancer. There are different types of treatment for children with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Children with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer. Four types of standard treatment are used:SurgeryChemotherapyHigh-dose 131I-MIBG therapyTargeted therapy New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Treatment of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma  may cause side effects. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Follow-up tests may be needed. Surgery Chemotherapy High-dose 131I-MIBG therapy Targeted therapy Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.  A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment. Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health professionals who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. This may include the following specialists and others: Pediatrician. Pediatric surgeon. Pathologist. Pediatric endocrinologist. Pediatric nurse specialist. Social worker. Rehabilitation specialist. Psychologist. Child-life specialist. Surgery to remove the tumor is the main treatment for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. For several days before surgery, your child may need to take blood pressure medicine to lower the risk of complications during and after surgery. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). 131I-MIBG therapy is a treatment with high-dose radioactive iodine. The radioactive iodine is given through an intravenous (IV) line and enters the bloodstream which carries radiation directly to tumor cells. Radioactive iodine collects in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma cells and kills them with the radiation that is given off. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Angiogenesis inhibitor drugs prevent the growth of new blood vessels needed for tumors to grow. Sunitinib is an angiogenesis inhibitor used to treat pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. To learn more about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, visit Side Effects. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or checkups. Some tests that were done to diagnose or stage the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). For patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma that causes symptoms, catecholamine levels in the blood and urine will be checked on a regular basis. Catecholamine levels that are higher than normal can be a sign that the cancer has come back.
Talk to your child’s doctor about which tests should be done and how often. Patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma need lifelong follow-up. For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview  section. Treatment of newly diagnosed pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma in children may include the following: Surgery to completely remove the tumor. Combination chemotherapy, high-dose 131I-MIBG therapy, or targeted therapy for tumors that have spread to other parts of the body. Before surgery, drug therapy with alpha-blockers to control blood pressure and beta-blockers to control heart rate are given. If both adrenal glands are removed, life-long hormone therapy to replace  hormones made by the adrenal glands is needed after surgery.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish. PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board. A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

T!tle : Cancer Drug Target Visualized at Atomic Resolution - NCI

d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  2016  New study using cryo-electron microscopy shows how potential drugs could inhibit cancer   News Releases   Posted:
January 28, 2016  240-760-6600 The protein p97 is trapped in an inactive state by a new inhibitor (red) and the molecule cannot proceed into its normal reaction cycle. A new study shows that it is possible to use an imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to view, in atomic detail, the binding of a potential small molecule drug to a key protein in cancer cells. The cryo-EM images also helped the researchers establish, at atomic resolution, the sequence of structural changes that normally occur in the protein, p97, an enzyme critical for protein regulation that is thought to be a novel anti-cancer target. The study appeared online January 28, 2016, in Science. Sriram Subramaniam, Ph.D., of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Center for Cancer Research, led the research. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health. “Cryo-EM is positioned to become an even more useful tool in structural biology and cancer drug development,” said Douglas Lowy, M.D., acting director, NCI. “This latest finding provides a tantalizing possibility for advancing effective drug development.” To determine structures by cryo-EM, protein suspensions are flash-frozen at very low temperatures; nevertheless, the water around the protein molecules stays liquid-like. The suspensions are then bombarded with electrons to capture their images. To produce three-dimensional protein structures using cryo-EM, researchers generate thousands of two-dimensional images of the molecules in different orientations, which are then averaged together. This type of imaging procedure has gained in popularity in structural biology research because it allows for the observation of specimens that have not been stained or fixed in any way, enabling visualization of the specimens under near-native, or natural, conditions. Earlier structural studies of full-length p97 by a well-established technique known as X-ray crystallography have been limited so far to medium resolution (3.5 Å to 4.7 Å). With cryo-EM, however, researchers were able to image full-length p97 at an overall resolution of 2.3 Å, which is much finer, allowing them to visualize key regions of the protein in atomic detail. Most significantly, the mode of binding and contact sites of a small molecule inhibitor of p97 activity could be observed directly. Drug development efforts often involve mapping the contacts between small molecules and their binding sites on specific proteins. With this latest finding, the resolutions achieved were significant enough to discern both the shape of the protein chain and some of the hydrogen bonds between the protein and the small molecule inhibitor. “Our latest research provides new insights into the protein structures and interactions that are critical for the activity of a cancer cell, and this knowledge will hopefully enable the design of clinically useful drugs,” said Subramaniam. Subramaniam and colleagues recently used cryo-EM to understand the functioning of a variety of molecules, including proteins and receptors found in brain cells. The level of detail achieved in their new study however, resolutions of 2.3 Å and 2.4 Å for p97 with and without the bound inhibitor, are second only the 2.2 Å resolution structure reported last year in Science for an enzyme, also by the same group of NCI researchers.

Research   Causes & Risk Factors  Stomach Cancer Symptoms  Screening  Diagnosis  Prognosis & Survival Rates  Stages  Treatment  Childhood Stomach Cancer  Coping & Treatment Issues  Health Professional  Research  Stomach pain or discomfort can be a symptom of stomach cancer. Early on, stomach cancer usually doesn’t have symptoms, making it hard to detect. Symptoms usually begin after the cancer has spread. When symptoms of early-stage stomach cancer do occur, they may include indigestion and stomach discomfort  a bloated feeling after eating  mild nausea  loss of appetite  heartburn  Symptoms of advanced stomach cancer (cancer has spread beyond the stomach to other parts of the body) may include the symptoms of early-stage stomach cancer and blood in the stool  vomiting  weight loss for no known reason  stomach pain  jaundice (yellowing of eyes and skin)  ascites (build-up of fluid in the abdomen)  trouble swallowing  These symptoms may be caused by many conditions other than stomach cancer. It’s important to check with your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. Your doctor will ask when your symptoms started and how often you’ve been having them. If it is stomach cancer, ignoring symptoms can delay treatment and make it less effective. To learn more, see Stomach Cancer Diagnosis.  Updated:

Inheritance and RiskSeveral hereditary syndromes involve the endocrine or neuroendocrine glands. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 (MEN4), familial pheochromocytoma (PHEO) and paraganglioma (PGL) syndrome (FPPL), Carney-Stratakis syndrome (CSS), and familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) are discussed in this summary. Autosomal dominant pathogenic variants cause most of these syndromes. PHEOs and PGLs may also be found in individuals with von Hippel-Lindau disease. For more information, see von Hippel-Lindau Disease. Associated Genes and SyndromesMEN1, which is primarily associated with the development of parathyroid tumors and primary hyperparathyroidism, duodenopancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), and pituitary tumors, is caused by germline pathogenic variants in the MEN1 gene. The primary endocrine features of MEN2, which is subdivided into MEN2A and MEN2B, include medullary thyroid cancer (MTC); its precursor, C-cell hyperplasia; PHEO; and parathyroid adenomas and/or hyperplasia. MEN2 is caused by germline pathogenic variants in the RET gene. MEN4 is a rare syndrome with clinical features that overlap with the other MEN syndromes; the most common features are primary hyperparathyroidism and pituitary adenomas. MEN4 is caused by germline pathogenic variants in the CDKN1B gene. Both FPPL and CSS are caused by germline pathogenic variants in the SDH genes. PHEOs and PGLs commonly occur sporadically as well, although up to 33% of apparently sporadic PHEOs in individuals with no known family history and up to 40% of apparently sporadic PGLs have a recognizable germline pathogenic variant in one of the known PGL/PHEO susceptibility genes. Multifocal, locally aggressive gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are also found in individuals with CSS. FNMTC is a polygenic disease with no single locus responsible for the majority of cases or easily identifiable phenotype and is likely modified by multiple low-penetrance alleles and environmental factors. Clinical ManagementRegular surveillance is a mainstay in individuals found to have or be at risk of carrying a pathogenic variant in MEN1, RET, CDKN1B, or one of the SDH genes. Surveillance recommendations include regular screening for both endocrine and nonendocrine manifestations of disease.
Surgical management of pituitary and parathyroid tumors in MEN1 is based on disease presentation and management of symptoms of the organ. Surgical management of duodenopancreatic NETs of MEN1 is more specific to preventing disease progression. 
The decision to operate on PHEOs and PGLs in MEN2 is based on hormonal hypersecretion and symptomatology. Treatment of MTC consists of surgical removal of the entire thyroid gland, including the posterior capsule, and central lymph node dissection. In addition, risk-reducing thyroidectomy has been shown to reduce the subsequent incidence of persistent or recurrent disease in MEN2 patients who had thyroidectomy earlier in life. The timing of risk-reducing thyroidectomy is guided by the risks associated with specific RET variants, although basal calcitonin levels may be used to determine the optimal timing of the procedure. MEN2-related parathyroid disease may also be treated surgically or with medical therapy in high-risk surgical patients. Parathyroid and pituitary tumors associated with MEN4 are also managed surgically, in accordance with treatment for other familial syndromes such as MEN1.FPPL-associated PHEOs and PGLs are also treated surgically. Preoperative management aimed at preventing catecholamine-induced complications of the surgery is common. 
The mainstay of treatment for CSS-associated GISTs and PGLs is complete surgical resection of the tumor. The timing of the operation correlates with the presentation of the tumor.
Thyroid cancers associated with FNMTC are also managed surgically, commonly with a total thyroidectomy. Patients who undergo a total thyroidectomy must receive lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Several hereditary syndromes involve the endocrine or neuroendocrine glands. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 (MEN4), familial pheochromocytoma (PHEO) and paraganglioma (PGL) syndrome (FPPL), Carney-Stratakis syndrome (CSS), and familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) are discussed in this summary. Autosomal dominant pathogenic variants cause most of these syndromes. PHEOs and PGLs may also be found in individuals with von Hippel-Lindau disease.

When a linked term is clicked, the definition will appear in a separate window.] [Note: Many of the genes and conditions described in this summary are found in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) catalog. For more information, see OMIM.] [Note: A concerted effort is being made within the genetics community to shift terminology used to describe genetic variation. The shift is to use the term “variant” rather than the term “mutation” to describe a difference that exists between the person or group being studied and the reference sequence, particularly for differences that exist in the germline. Variants can then be further classified as benign (harmless), likely benign, of uncertain significance, likely pathogenic, or pathogenic (disease causing). Throughout this summary, we will use the term pathogenic variant to describe a disease-causing mutation. For more information about variant classification, see Cancer Genetics Overview.] There are several hereditary syndromes that involve endocrine or neuroendocrine glands, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 (MEN4), pheochromocytoma (PHEO), paraganglioma (PGL), Li-Fraumeni syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and von Hippel-Lindau disease. This summary currently focuses on MEN1, MEN2, MEN4, familial PHEO and PGL syndrome, Carney-Stratakis (CSS) syndrome, and familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC).  Li-Fraumeni syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, Cowden syndrome, and von Hippel-Lindau disease are discussed in the following PDQ summaries:  Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers, Genetics of Colorectal Cancer, and von Hippel-Lindau Disease. The term multiple endocrine neoplasia  is used to describe a group of heritable tumors in endocrine tissues, which can be benign or malignant.  Multiple endocrine neoplasias are typically classified into two main categories:   MEN1 (also known as Wermer syndrome) and MEN2.    Historically, MEN2 was further divided into three subtypes based on the presence or absence of certain endocrine tumors in an individual or family: MEN2A, familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC), and MEN2B (which is sometimes referred to as MEN3). FMTC is now considered a subtype of MEN2A.[1] MEN4 was described as a novel syndrome in humans in 2011. Major characteristics of MEN4 include primary hyperparathyroidism and pituitary adenomas. MEN syndrome–associated  tumors usually manifest as the overproduction of hormones, tumor growth, or both. For more information, see the  MEN1,  MEN2, and MEN4 sections. PGLs and PHEOs are rare tumors arising from chromaffin cells, which have the ability to synthesize, store, and secrete catecholamines and neuropeptides.[2] Either tumor may occur sporadically, as a manifestation of a hereditary syndrome, or as the sole tumor in familial PGL and PHEO syndrome. For more information, see the Familial PHEO and PGL Syndrome section. Affected individuals with Carney-Stratakis syndrome (CSS) have multifocal, locally aggressive gastrointestinal stromal tumors and multiple neck, intrathoracic, and intra-abdominal PGLs at relatively young ages.[3-5] CSS is distinct from similarly named syndromes, Carney Complex and Carney Triad. For more information, see the CSS section. Familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) is thought to account for 5% to 10% of all differentiated thyroid cancer cases.[6-8] With the exception of a few rare genetic syndromes that include nonmedullary thyroid cancer as a minor component, most FNMTC is nonsyndromic, and the underlying genetic predisposition is unclear.

Duodenopancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Pituitary tumors. A clinical diagnosis of MEN1 may be made  when an individual has two of the three major endocrine tumors listed above, especially if  he/she was diagnosed with these tumors at a young age.  Alternatively, familial MEN1 may be defined as having at least one MEN1 case in the family plus at least one first-degree relative (FDR) with one of these three tumors, or two FDRs with a germline pathogenic variant.[2-5] Initial clinical presentation of symptoms typically occurs between the ages of 20 and 30 years. However, in many cases, an MEN1 diagnosis may not be confirmed for many years after initial symptoms occur. The age-related penetrance of MEN1 is 45% to 73% by age 30 years, 82% by age 50 years, and 96% by age 70 years.[2,5-7] To date, there are no well-established genotype-phenotype correlations to guide clinical management of patients with MEN1. The most common features and often the first presenting signs of MEN1 are parathyroid tumors, which result in PHPT. These tumors occur in 80% to 100% of patients by age 50 years.[8,9]   MEN1-associated parathyroid tumors are typically multiglandular and hyperplastic. This differs from sporadic parathyroid tumors, which often present with a solitary adenoma.[10] The mean age of PHPT onset  is 20 to 25 years in individuals with MEN1. In contrast, PHPT onset occurs in the general population at age 50 to 59 years.  When MEN1 presents in childhood, the most common presenting feature is multi-gland hyperparathyroidism.[11] Parathyroid carcinoma in MEN1 is rare but has been described.[12-14] Individuals with MEN1-associated PHPT will have elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium levels in the blood. The clinical manifestations of PHPT are mainly the result of hypercalcemia. Mild hypercalcemia may go undetected and have few or no symptoms. More severe hypercalcemia can result in the following: Constipation. Nausea and vomiting. Dehydration. Decreased appetite and abdominal pain. Anorexia. Diuresis. Kidney stones. Increased bone resorption with resultant increased risk of bone fracture. Lethargy. Depression. Confusion. Hypertension. Shortened QT interval. Since MEN1-associated hypercalcemia is directly related to the presence of parathyroid tumors, surgical removal of these tumors may normalize calcium  and PTH levels. This can help relieve an individual's  symptoms. However, there have been high recurrence rates of parathyroid tumors after  surgery in some series.[15-17] For more information, see the Interventions section. Duodenopancreatic NETs are the second most common endocrine manifestation in MEN1, occurring in 30% to 80% of patients by age 40 years.[2,8] A study has shown that the incidence may be as great as twofold higher in young patients (aged 20–40 y) with pathogenic variants in exon 2 of MEN1. These individuals are also more likely to have more aggressive disease and distant metastases.[18] Furthermore, duodenopancreatic NETs are associated with early mortality even after surgical resection.[19] Duodenopancreatic NETs seen in MEN1 include the following: Gastrinomas. Nonfunctioning NETs. Insulinomas. Vasoactive intestinal peptide tumors (VIPomas). Glucagonomas. Somatostatinomas. Gastrinomas represent 50% of the gastrointestinal NETs in MEN1 and are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in MEN1 patients.[2,15] Gastrinomas are usually multicentric, with small (<0.5 cm) foci throughout the duodenum.[23] Most result in peptic ulcer disease (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), and half are malignant at the time of diagnosis.[5,15,23,24] Originally, nonfunctioning duodenopancreatic NETs were thought to be uncommon in individuals with MEN1.   However, recognition of these tumors has increased with advanced genetic testing and improved imaging techniques. For example, a prospective   study   showed that MEN1 pathogenic variant carriers had a nonfunctioning duodenopancreatic NET frequency  of 55% by age 39 years when they underwent  endoscopic ultrasonography of the pancreas.[21,25] These tumors can be metastatic. One study of 108 MEN1 pathogenic variant carriers with nonfunctioning duodenopancreatic NETs showed a positive correlation between tumor size, rate of metastasis, and death. Individuals with tumors larger than 2 cm had significantly higher rates of metastasis  than those with tumors smaller than 2 cm.[26] For more information, see the Molecular Genetics of MEN1 section. Approximately 15% to 50% of MEN1 patients will develop a pituitary tumor.[2,8]  Two-thirds are microadenomas (<1.0 cm in diameter), and the majority are prolactin-secreting.[27] Other pituitary tumors can include somatotropinomas and corticotropinomas, or they may be nonfunctioning. Other manifestations of MEN1 include carcinoids of the foregut (5%–10% of MEN1 patients). These are typically bronchial or thymic and are sometimes gastric. Skin lesions are also common and can include facial angiofibromas (up to 80% of MEN1 patients) and collagenomas (~75% of MEN1 patients).[28] Lipomas (~30% of MEN1 patients) and   adrenal cortical lesions (up to 50% of MEN1 patients),[29] including cortical adenomas, diffuse or nodular hyperplasia, or rarely, carcinoma are also common.[30-32] The following manifestations have also been reported:[33-35] Thyroid adenoma. Pheochromocytoma. Spinal ependymoma. Meningioma. Leiomyoma (e.g., esophageal, lung, and uterine). MEN1 is often difficult to diagnose in the absence of a significant family history or a positive genetic test for a pathogenic variant in the MEN1 gene. One study of 560 individuals with MEN1 showed a significant delay between the time of the first presenting symptom and the diagnosis of MEN1.[36] This time lapse is likely because some presenting symptoms of MEN1-associated tumors, such as amenorrhea, peptic ulcers, hypoglycemia, and nephrolithiasis, are not specific to MEN1. Furthermore, identification of an MEN1-associated tumor  is not sufficient to make the clinical diagnosis of MEN1 and may not trigger a referral to an endocrinologist. The median time between the first presenting symptom and diagnosis of MEN1 ranges from 7.6 years to 12 years.[6,31] Genetic testing alleviates some of this delay. Several studies have shown statistically significant differences in the age at MEN1 diagnosis between probands and their family members. In one study, clinically symptomatic probands were diagnosed with MEN1 at a mean age of 47.5 years (standard deviation [SD] +/- 13.5 y), while family members were diagnosed at a mean age of 38.5 years (SD +/- 15.4 y; P < .001).[36] In another study of 154 individuals with MEN1, probands were diagnosed at a mean age of 39.5 years (range: 18–74 y), compared with  a mean age of 27 years (range: 14–56 y; P < .05) in family members diagnosed by predictive genetic testing.[37] Nonetheless, the lag time between the diagnosis of MEN1 in an index case and the diagnosis of MEN1 in family members can be significant, leading to increased morbidity and mortality.[38] This was demonstrated in a Dutch MEN1 Study Group analysis, which showed that 10% to 38% of non-index cases already had an MEN1-related manifestation at diagnosis; 4% of these individuals died of an MEN1-related cause that developed during or before the lag time. In family members, the majority of the morbidity related to lag time was due to metastatic duodenopancreatic NETs, pituitary macroadenomas, and multiple MEN1 manifestations.[38] Early intervention is particularly critical as it relates to mortality from duodenopancreatic NETs. A study showed that for every year older at time of surgery, the odds of metastasis increased by 6%.[19] These findings underscore the importance of increased awareness of the signs and symptoms of MEN1-related tumors and the constellation of findings necessary to suspect the diagnosis. It also highlights the importance of genetic counseling and testing and communication among family members once a diagnosis of MEN1 is made.[39,40] Figure 1 illustrates some of the challenges in identifying MEN1 in a family. Since many of the tumors in MEN1 are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, identifying an MEN1 gene pathogenic variant in the proband early  in the disease process can allow for early detection and treatment of tumors and earlier identification of at-risk family members. Many studies have been performed to determine the prevalence of MEN1 gene pathogenic variants among patients with apparently sporadic MEN1-related tumors.[8] For example, approximately one-third of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome will carry an MEN1 pathogenic variant.[41,42] In individuals with apparently isolated PHPT or pituitary adenomas, the pathogenic variant prevalence is lower, on the order of 2% to 5%,[27,43,44] but the prevalence is higher in individuals diagnosed with these tumors before age 30 years. Some authors suggest referral for genetics consultation and/or genetic testing for pathogenic variants in MEN1 if one of the following conditions is present:[8,45-47] Gastrinoma at any age in the individual or an FDR. Multifocal duodenopancreatic NETs at any age. PHPT before age 30 or 40 years. Multiglandular parathyroid adenomas/hyperplasia or recurrent PHPT. Presence of one of the three main MEN1 tumors plus one of the less common tumors/findings. Presence of  two  or more features (e.g., adrenal adenomas and carcinoid tumor). Combination of at least two of the following in one individual: parathyroid adenoma; thymic, bronchial, or foregut carcinoid tumor; duodenopancreatic NET; pituitary tumor; adrenal tumor. Parathyroid adenoma and a family history of hyperparathyroidism, pituitary
adenoma, duodenopancreatic NET, or foregut carcinoid tumor. Multiple primary duodenopancreatic NETs in the same person. The MEN1 gene is located on chromosome 11q13 and encodes the protein menin.[3,48,49] Over 1,300 pathogenic variants have been identified in the MEN1 gene to date, and these are scattered across the entire coding region.[50,51] Most (~65%) of these are nonsense or frameshift variants. The remainder are missense variants (20%) (which lead to the expression of an altered protein), splice-site variants (9%), or partial- or whole-gene deletions (1%–4%).[52] In MEN1, phenotypic variation is common within a family and between unrelated individuals. Data suggested that anticipation may also occur in families with MEN1 pathogenic variants.[8,53-55] One large study demonstrated that pituitary, adrenal, and thymic NETs had the highest rates of heritability.[56] Genetic testing for MEN1 pathogenic variants is recommended for individuals meeting clinical diagnostic criteria and may be considered in individuals with  less common MEN1-associated tumors. For more information, see the Making the diagnosis of MEN1 section. For individuals meeting diagnostic criteria, the pathogenic variant detection rate is approximately 75% to 90%.[53,57]  Still, germline pathogenic variant yield ranged from 16% to 38% for apparently sporadic cases of parathyroid (15.8%), pancreatic islet (25.0%), or pituitary (37.5%) tumors. Genetic testing may be warranted in  these individuals because a diagnosis of MEN1 would prompt screening for other MEN1-related tumors.[58]  Laboratories  that offer MEN1 testing primarily use DNA sequencing. Several laboratories offer additional analyses for MEN1 partial- or whole-gene deletion and/or duplication. However, these types of variants are rare. Deletion/duplication testing is often reserved for individuals who have very high clinical suspicions for MEN1 but a detectable pathogenic variant was not found by direct DNA sequencing. Evolving  studies continue to reveal causative pathogenic variants in MEN1.[52] A multigene panel that includes MEN1 and other genes associated with an increased risk of endocrine tumors may also be used. Such genetic testing can be used to distinguish between MEN1 and other forms of hereditary hyperparathyroidism, such as familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP), hyperparathyroidism–jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT), and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH). [Note: The hyperparathyroidism in FHH is not primary hyperparathyroidism, which is seen in MEN1, HPT-JT and FIHP.] HPT-JT, which is caused by germline pathogenic variants in the CDC73 gene, is associated with PHPT, ossifying lesions of the maxilla and mandible, and renal lesions, usually bilateral renal cysts, hamartomas, and in some cases, Wilms tumor.[59,60] Unlike MEN1, HPT-JT is associated with an increased risk of parathyroid carcinoma.[61] FIHP, as its name suggests, is characterized by isolated PHPT with no additional endocrine features;  in some families, FIHP is the initial diagnosis of what later develops into MEN1, HPT-JT, or FHH.[62-64] Approximately 20% of families with a clinical diagnosis of FIHP carry germline MEN1 pathogenic variants.[63,65,66]  Pathogenic variants in the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) gene cause FHH, which can closely mimic the hyperparathyroidism seen in MEN1. Genetic diagnosis will help guide management for patients with early-onset hyperparathyroidism. This is especially crucial, since many of the above conditions have different management guidelines that correspond with their features. For example, distinguishing between MEN1 and FHH can be critical for a patient's disease management. Removing the parathyroid glands in FHH does not correct the hyperparathyroidism that is seen in patients with MEN1. This could result in an unnecessary surgery that would not relieve the patient's symptoms. In addition, HPT-JT is unique because it increases parathyroid carcinoma risk. Hence, individuals with this syndrome have different management guidelines than individuals with other forms of hereditary hyperparathyroidism.[67,68] For more information on MEN1 clinical features and other forms of hyperparathyroidism, see Table 3. Screening and surveillance for MEN1 may  include a combination of biochemical  tests and imaging techniques. Traditionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used for surveillance and staging. However, ongoing studies have evaluated the role of MRI in functional imaging, including gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE (68Ga-DOTATATE) positron emission tomography (PET)–computed tomography (CT) scanning. A  multicenter retrospective study examined 108 MEN1 patients undergoing PET-CT for screening, staging, restaging, or targeted radiotherapy selection. This study demonstrated that PET-CT has the potential to increase diagnostic sensitivity when searching for MEN1-associated NETs.[73]  In 51% of cases, PET-CT provided superior lesion detection when compared with conventional imaging techniques. However, the retrospective nature of the study makes it impossible to discern how much selection bias may have impacted the study's findings. Consequently,  PET-CT's exact role in detecting  metastasis remains unclear. PET-CT's potentially improved diagnostic sensitivity must also be weighed against its increased levels of  radiation exposure, which are  higher than that of other imaging modalities. Radiation exposure is particularly relevant for MEN1 patients, who are prone to developing aggressive malignancies. The issue is even more nuanced in  young patients who require lifelong screening to detect aggressive MEN1-associated malignancies early. A study analyzed thoracic screening techniques in 50 patients with MEN1. It found that when patients with MEN1 underwent functional imaging with fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET-CT  screening, they had  a similar number of lung nodules as individuals in  the general population. However, when  lesions  in MEN1 patients were FDG-avid, they were more likely to progress during the follow-up period. Therefore, further observation and follow up of FDG-avid lesions may be warranted in patients with MEN1.[74] While lung-specific imaging is not routinely performed in MEN1 patients, the lungs are visualized during MRI surveillance of thymic lesions. When pulmonary lesions are identified, it is important to recognize that lung NETs may  grow slowly and may have a good prognosis. Referral to a multidisciplinary team may be beneficial for selective resection of lung NETs.[75] Recommendations for MEN1 surveillance are summarized in Table 4.[4,8] Surgical management of MEN1 is complex and controversial, given the multifocal and multiglandular nature of the disease. Patients with MEN1 have a high risk of tumor recurrence, even after surgery. Additionally, these patients may have an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolisms.[79] Clinicians should be aware of this risk, particularly in the perioperative period. It is critical to establish an MEN1 diagnosis  before making surgical decisions, in order to prevent unnecessary and/or inappropriate surgeries. Furthermore, it is recommended that individuals  with MEN1 use a surgeon who has experience treating this disease. Once evidence of parathyroid disease is established biochemically,  surgical removal of the hyperfunctional parathyroid tissue is recommended to achieve eucalcemia and euparathyroidism. However, the timing and the amount of parathyroid and thymus gland tissue that is removed during surgery remains controversial.[40] For patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who are at risk for MEN1, preoperative detection of a pathogenic variant helps guide the extent of their initial operations, can increase the likelihood of successful initial surgeries, and lower the likelihood of recurrent disease.[68] Furthermore, knowledge of an MEN1 pathogenic variant can help guide surgical decision making and avoid the use of a single-gland surgical approach. Studies have shown that concomitant bilateral cervical thymectomy decreases the rate of parathyroid tumor recurrence and  suggests that the thymus can be removed during the patient's initial operation.[80] Some groups reserve surgical intervention for symptomatic patients, with continued annual biochemical screening for those without  objective signs of disease. Subtotal parathyroidectomy (removal of 3–3.5 glands) is commonly suggested as the initial surgical treatment when a provider decides to proceed with surgery.[68] If 3.5 or more glands are removed during surgery, the rate of persistent disease is only 5% to 6%. Removing fewer than 3.5 glands decreases the durability of eucalcemia. Studies suggest that preoperative imaging (to determine which glands are hyperfunctional) is not reliable enough to justify unilateral exploration, with 86% of patients having enlarged contralateral parathyroid glands.[81] Fifty percent of the patients who had imaging to direct resection had the largest parathyroid gland identified intraoperatively on the contralateral side of greatest uptake.[81]  Insufficient resection fails to accomplish the desired eucalcemia.[15-17,68] Total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue to a distant site, such as the forearm, is a less commonly recommended option. Likelihood of cancer recurrence is lowered with total parathyroidectomy. However, this procedure also renders the patient aparathyroid for a period of time while the autotransplanted tissue becomes functional. This can cause a permanent PTH deficiency (no detectable PTH in the body).[80,82] Benefits of this approach include the following: 1) it is easier remove/debulk recurrent disease from the forearm than it is to remove/debulk recurrent disease from the neck, and 2) differential lateralization with arm blood draws.  Hypocalcemia management involves taking numerous oral medications, including calcitrol and calcium replacement, and these daily requirements can be a major burden for patients. Recovery was less likely for patients who were aparathyroid for  6 months after total parathyroidectomy.[83]   In select high-risk patients, like in those who had reoperative parathyroidectomy or cervical surgery, cryopreservation can be beneficial,  but it is recommended that providers use this method sparingly. The timing and extent of surgery for duodenopancreatic NETs are controversial and depend on many factors, including severity of symptoms, extent of disease, functional component, location and necessity of simple enucleation, subtotal or total pancreatectomy, and pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure). Surgical enucleation has been associated with higher recurrence compared with distal pancreatectomy, and a decreased rate of endocrine insufficiency compared with a Whipple procedure.[84] Tumor size has been suggested to advocate  for surgical resection on the basis of the increased propensity for risk of metastases or recurrence with increased tumor diameter.[5,85,86] Unfortunately, there is no specific tumor marker or combination of tumor markers that are predictive of disease-specific mortality.[87] Long-acting somatostatin analogs may have a role in early-stage MEN1 duodenopancreatic NETs.[88] Initial study results of pharmacological therapy suggest that the treatment is safe and that long-term suppression of tumor and hormonal activity can be seen in up to 10% of patients and stability of hormone hyperfunction in 80% of patients.[88] The primary goal of surgery is to improve long-term survival by reducing symptoms associated with hormone excess and lowering the risk of distant metastasis.[24]  Surgery is commonly performed for most functional tumors and for nonfunctioning NETs when the tumor exceeds 2 to 3 cm because the likelihood of distant metastases is high.[86,89-91]
 Structural imaging modalities alone are suboptimal for predicting the malignant potential of duodenopancreatic NETs. However, a study found that screening MEN1 patients with 18F-FDG PET-CT identified those NETs with an increased malignant potential; the FDG avidity correlated with a Ki-67 index.[92] Tumor size does seem to influence patient survival, with patients with smaller tumors having increased survival after resection.[93]  While more-extensive surgical approaches (e.g., pancreatoduodenectomy) have been associated with higher cure rates and improved overall survival,[94-96] they also have higher rates of postoperative complications and long-term morbidity.[97] Therefore, the risks and benefits should be carefully considered, and surgical decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis. With regard to open or laparoscopic approaches, in selected patients, pancreatic laparoscopic surgery appears to be safe and associated with a shorter length of stay and fewer complications.[98] Individuals with MEN1 who are diagnosed with NETs often have multiple tumors of various types throughout the pancreas and duodenum, some of which can be identified using magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography (CT). Combining functional tracer accumulation with anatomic imaging improves tumor localization. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT demonstrates excellent sensitivity in mapping duodenopancreatic NET disease. This modality may guide the initial workup and appears to be superior to standard somatostatin octreotide, especially for lesions smaller than 10 mm.[99,100] Many tumors are too small to be detected using standard imaging techniques, and intra-arterial secretin stimulation testing and/or intraoperative ultrasonography may also be useful.[101,102] Preoperative assessment using a combination of various biochemical and imaging modalities, intraoperative assessment of tumor burden, and resolution of hormonal hyper-secretion are critical and, in some series, have been associated with higher cure rates and longer disease-free intervals.[101-104] In the current era of effective treatment for hyperfunctional hormone excess states, most MEN1-related deaths are due to the malignant nature of duodenopancreatic NETs. A less common but important risk of death  is from malignant thymic carcinoid tumors.   Indicators of a poor MEN1 prognosis include elevated fasting serum gastrin, the presence of functional hormonal syndromes,  liver or distant metastases, aggressive  duodenopancreatic NET growth,  large  duodenopancreatic NET size,  or the need for multiple parathyroidectomies.   The most common cause of non-MEN1–related death in this patient cohort is from cardiovascular disease.[105] Glucagonomas, VIPomas, and somatostatinomas are rare but often have higher rates of malignancy than other duodenopancreatic NETs.[22] These are often treated with aggressive surgery.[106] Medical management of insulinoma using diet and medication is often unsuccessful; the mainstay of treatment for this tumor is surgical resection.[8] Insulinomas in MEN1 patients can be located throughout the pancreas, with a preponderance found in the distal gland,[107-109] and have a higher rate of metastasis than sporadic insulinoma.[106] Surgery can range from enucleation of single or multiple large tumors to partial pancreatic resection, or both,[108]  to subtotal or total pancreatectomy.[107,108] More-extensive surgical approaches are associated with a lower rate of recurrence [94,95,108,110] but a higher rate of postoperative morbidity. Because insulinoma often occurs in conjunction with nonfunctioning pancreatic tumors, the selective intra-arterial calcium-injection test (SAS test) may be necessary to determine the source of insulin excess.[111] Intraoperative monitoring of insulin/glucose can help determine whether insulin-secreting tumors have been successfully excised.[102,112] Most MEN1-associated gastrinomas originate in the duodenum. These tumors are typically multifocal and cause hyper-secretion of gastrin, with resultant peptic ulcer disease (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome).[113] The multifocal nature makes complete surgical resection difficult. It is critical to manage symptoms before considering any type of surgical intervention.[114] Historically, some groups have recommended close observation of individuals with smaller tumors (<2.0 cm on imaging) who have relief of symptoms using medications (e.g., proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 agonists);[115] however, this approach may not be optimal for all patients. Several published series have shown a positive correlation between primary tumor size and rate of distant metastasis. One retrospective study showed that 61% of patients with tumors larger than 3 cm had liver metastases.[24] In another series, 40% of patients with tumors larger than 3 cm had liver metastases.[116] In contrast, both of these series showed significantly lower rates of liver metastases in individuals with tumors smaller than 3 cm (32% and 4.8%, respectively). On the basis of these and other data, many groups recommend surgery in individuals with nonmetastatic gastrinoma who have tumors larger than 2 cm.[8,96] The type of surgery for gastrinoma depends on many factors. A Whipple procedure is typically discouraged as an initial surgery, given the high postoperative morbidity and long-term complications, such as diabetes mellitus and malabsorption. Less extensive operations have been described with varying results. At a minimum, duodenectomy with intraoperative palpation and/or ultrasonography to locate and excise duodenal tumors and peri-pancreatic lymph node dissection are  performed.[101,117] Because most patients with gastrinoma will have concomitant NETs throughout the pancreas, some of which may be nonfunctional, some groups recommend resection of the distal pancreas and enucleation of tumors in the pancreatic head in addition to duodenal tumor excision.[101,117,118] Approximately 50% of individuals with MEN1 will develop nonfunctioning NETs.[21,26] These are often identified incidentally during assessment and exploration for functioning tumors.  As with gastrinomas, the metastatic rate is correlated with larger tumor size.[26,86] Tumors smaller than 1.5 cm are not likely to have lymph node metastases,[119] although the presence of metastatic disease has been associated with earlier age at death than in those  without duodenopancreatic NETs.[9,26] Medical therapy to suppress hypersecretion is often the first line of therapy for MEN1-associated pituitary tumors. In one series of 136 patients, medical therapy was successful in approximately one-half of patients with secreting tumors (49 of 116, 42%), and successful suppression was correlated with smaller tumor size.[120] Surgery is often necessary for patients who are resistant to this treatment. Radiation therapy is reserved for patients for whom complete surgical resection was not rendered.[8,121] Agarwal SK, Ozawa A, Mateo CM, et al.: The MEN1 gene and pituitary tumours.

hyperplasia (CCH) (referred to as C-cell neoplasia or C-cell carcinoma in situ in more recent publications)[1]; pheochromocytoma (PHEO); and parathyroid adenomas and/or hyperplasia.
MEN2-associated MTC is often bilateral and/or multifocal and arises in the background of CCH clonal C-cell proliferation. In contrast, sporadic MTC is typically unilateral and/or unifocal. Because approximately 75% to 80% of sporadic cases also have associated CCH, this histopathologic feature cannot be used as a predictor of familial disease.[2]  Metastatic spread of MTC to regional lymph nodes (i.e.,
perithyroidal, paratracheal, jugular chain, and upper mediastinum) or to distant
sites, such as the liver, is common in patients who
present with a palpable thyroid mass or diarrhea.[3,4]  When thyroidectomy is performed before local nodal metastases occur, distant metastases are rare.[5] Metastatic PHEOs have not been reported in individuals with MEN2.[6] In MEN2, parathyroid
abnormalities  can range from benign parathyroid adenomas or multigland hyperplasia to clinically evident
hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcemia and renal stones. Historically, individuals with MEN2 were given one of the following clinical subtypes based on the presence or absence of certain endocrine tumors in the individual/family: MEN2A. Familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC). MEN2B (sometimes referred to as MEN3). Current stratification has moved away from a solely phenotype-based classification to one that is based on genotype (i.e., the pathogenic variant) and phenotype.[7] Current classification now includes two MEN2 syndromes: MEN2A and MEN2B.  The MEN2A syndrome is further classified on the basis of the presence of associated conditions.  For example, classical MEN2A includes those with MTC,  PHEO, and/or hyperparathyroidism.  Additional categories include MEN2A with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis, MEN2A with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), and FMTC (presence of a RET germline pathogenic variant and MTC but no family history of PHEO or hyperparathyroidism).[1] Classifying a patient or family by MEN2 subtype is useful in
determining prognosis and management. The prevalence of MEN2 has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 35,000 individuals.[8]   The vast majority of MEN2 cases are MEN2A. MTC originates in calcitonin-producing cells (C-cells) of the thyroid gland. 
MTC is diagnosed when nests of C-cells extend beyond the basement
membrane and infiltrate and destroy thyroid follicles.  CCH is a controversial diagnosis, but most pathologists agree that it is defined as more than seven C-cells per cluster, complete follicles surrounded by C-cells, and C-cells in a distribution beyond normal anatomical location.[1,9-11]  Individuals with RET pathogenic variants and CCH are at substantially increased risk of progressing to MTC.  MTC and CCH
are suspected in the presence of an elevated plasma calcitonin concentration. A study of 10,864 patients with nodular thyroid disease found 44 (1  of every 250) cases of MTC after stimulation with calcitonin, none of which were clinically suspected. Consequently, half of these patients had no evidence of MTC on fine-needle biopsy and thus might not have undergone surgery without the positive calcitonin stimulation test.[12] CCH associated with a positive calcitonin stimulation test occurs in
about 5% of the general population; therefore, the plasma calcitonin responses to
stimulation do not always distinguish CCH from small MTC and cannot always distinguish between carriers and noncarriers in an MEN2 family.[13-15] MTC accounts for 1% to 2% of new cases of thyroid cancer diagnosed annually in
the United States.[16] Approximately 75% of thyroid cancer cases diagnosed in the United States  are sporadic (i.e., they
occur in the absence of a family history of either MTC or other endocrine
abnormalities seen in MEN2).  The peak incidence of the sporadic form is in the
fifth and sixth decades of life.[3,17] A study in the
United Kingdom estimated the incidence of MTC at 20 to 25 new cases per year
among a population of 55 million.[18] In the absence of a positive family
history, MEN2 may be suspected when MTC occurs at an early age or is
bilateral or multifocal.  While small series of apparently sporadic MTC cases have suggested a higher prevalence of germline RET pathogenic variants,[19,20] larger series indicate a prevalence range of 1%  to 7%.[21,22] On the basis of these data,  testing for pathogenic variants in the RET gene  is widely recommended for all cases of MTC.[1,23] Level of evidence (Screening): 3 Thyroid cancer represents approximately 2.2%  of new malignancies occurring annually in the
United States, with an estimated 43,720 cancer diagnoses and 2,120  
cancer deaths expected in 2023.[24] Of these cancer diagnoses, 1% to 2% are MTC.[16] MTC arises from the parafollicular calcitonin-secreting cells of the thyroid
gland.  MTC occurs in sporadic and familial forms and may be preceded by
CCH, although CCH is a relatively common abnormality in
middle-aged adults.[9,10] Average survival for MTC is lower than that for more common
thyroid cancers (e.g., 86%–89% 5-year survival for MTC compared with 94%–98% 5-year
survival for papillary and follicular thyroid cancer).[16,25]  Survival is
correlated with stage at diagnosis, and decreased survival in MTC can be
accounted for in part by a high proportion of late-stage diagnosis.[26-28] In addition to early stage at diagnosis, other factors associated with improved
survival in MTC include smaller tumor size, younger age at diagnosis, and diagnosis by biochemical or genetic screening (i.e., screening for
calcitonin elevation, RET variants) versus symptoms.[27,29-31] A Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results population-based study of 1,252 MTC patients found that survival varied by extent of local disease. For example, the 10-year survival rates ranged from 95.6% for those with disease confined to the thyroid gland to 40% for those with distant metastases.[29] While most MTC cases are sporadic, approximately 20% to 25% are hereditary caused by  pathogenic variants in the RET proto-oncogene.[32] Pathogenic variants in the RET gene cause MEN2, an autosomal dominant disorder associated with a high lifetime risk of MTC. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant endocrinopathy that is genetically and clinically distinct
from MEN2; however, the similar nomenclature for MEN1 and MEN2 may cause
confusion. Individuals with MEN1 do not have an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer. For more information, see the MEN1 section. PHEOs arise from the catecholamine-producing chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. They are relatively rare tumors and are suspected among patients with refractory hypertension or
when biochemical screening reveals elevated excretion of catecholamines and
catecholamine metabolites (i.e., norepinephrine, epinephrine, metanephrine, and
vanillylmandelic acid) in 24-hour urine collections or plasma.   In the past, measurement of urinary catecholamines was considered the preferred biochemical screening method. However, given that catecholamines are only released intermittently and are metabolized in the adrenal medulla into metanephrine and normetanephrine, the measurement of urine or plasma fractionated metanephrines has become the gold standard.[33-38] When biochemical screening in an individual who has or is at risk of MEN2 suggests PHEO, localization studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography, can be performed.[39] Confirmation of the diagnosis can be made using iodine I 131-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy or positron emission tomography imaging.[14,39-41] In individuals with a personal history of PHEO, an MEN2 diagnosis is often considered in those with bilateral PHEOs, those with early age of PHEO onset (age <35 y), and those with a personal and/or family history of MTC or hyperparathyroidism. For more information, see the Familial PHEO and PGL Syndrome section.  However, MEN2 is not the only genetic disorder with a predisposition to PHEOs; other disorders include neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL),[42] and the hereditary paraganglioma syndromes.[43] For more information on VHL, see von Hippel-Lindau Disease. PHPT is the third most common endocrine disorder in the general population. The incidence increases with age with the vast majority of cases occurring after the sixth decade of life. Approximately 80% of cases are the result of a single adenoma.[44]  PHPT can also be seen as a component tumor in several different hereditary syndromes, including the following: MEN1. Hyperparathyroidism–jaw tumor syndrome. Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism. MEN2.[45-47] Hereditary PHPT is typically multiglandular, presents earlier in life, and can have histologic evidence of both adenoma and glandular hyperplasia. The diagnosis of the two MEN2 clinical subtypes relies on a combination of clinical
findings, family history, and molecular genetic testing of the RET gene. MEN2A is diagnosed clinically by the occurrence of two specific
endocrine tumors in addition to MTC:  PHEO and/or parathyroid adenoma and/or hyperplasia in
a single individual or in close relatives.[1] The classical  MEN2A subtype makes up about 60% to 90% of MEN2 cases.  The MEN2A subtype
was initially called Sipple syndrome.[48]  Since genetic testing for RET
pathogenic variants has become available, it has become apparent that about 95% of individuals
with MEN2A will develop MTC.[14,49-51] MTC is generally the first manifestation of MEN2A.  In asymptomatic at-risk individuals, stimulation testing may reveal elevated plasma calcitonin
levels and the presence of CCH or MTC.[14,50]  In families with MEN2A,
the biochemical manifestations of MTC generally appear between the ages of 5
years and 25 years (mean, 15 y).[14]  If presymptomatic screening is not performed, MTC
typically presents as a neck mass or neck pain between the ages of about age 5 years and 20 years. 
More than 50% of such patients have cervical lymph node metastases.[3] 
Diarrhea, the most frequent systemic symptom, occurs in patients with a markedly elevated plasma
calcitonin level or bulky disease and/or hepatic metastases   and implies a poor prognosis.[1,3,52,53]  Up to
30% of patients with MTC present with diarrhea and advanced disease.[54] MEN2-associated PHEOs are more often bilateral, multifocal, and associated with extratumoral medullary hyperplasia.[55-57]  They also have an earlier age of onset and are less likely to be malignant than their sporadic counterparts.[55,58] MEN2-associated PHEOs usually present after MTC, typically with intractable
hypertension.[59] Unlike the PHPT seen in MEN1, hyperparathyroidism in individuals with MEN2 is typically asymptomatic or associated with only mild elevations in calcium.[54,60] A series of 56 patients with MEN2-related hyperparathyroidism has been reported by the French Calcitonin Tumors Study Group.[60]  The median age at diagnosis was 38 years, documenting that this disorder is rarely the first manifestation of MEN2.  This is in sharp contrast to MEN1, in which the vast majority of patients (87%–99%) initially present with primary hyperparathyroidism.[61-63] Parathyroid abnormalities were found concomitantly with surgery for medullary thyroid cancer in 43 patients (77%).  Two-thirds of the patients were asymptomatic.  Among the 53 parathyroid glands removed surgically, there were 24 single adenomas, 4 double adenomas, and 25 hyperplastic glands. A small number of families with MEN2A have pruritic skin lesions known as cutaneous lichen amyloidosis.  This lichenoid
skin lesion is located over the upper portion of the back and may appear before
the onset of MTC.[64,65] HSCR, a disorder of the enteric plexus of the colon that typically results in enlargement of the bowel and constipation or obstipation in neonates, occurs in a small number of individuals with MEN2A-associated RET pathogenic variants.[66] Pathogenic variants at specific cysteine residues in exon 10 (i.e., codons 609, 618, and 620) are most commonly associated with HSCR, although individuals with pathogenic variants in other exons can still be affected.[67] HSCR can occur outside of a diagnosis of MEN2A and infants with HSCR may benefit from their own genetic evaluation regardless of the likelihood of MEN2A because HSCR can present as part of other syndromes. Up to 40% of familial cases of HSCR and 3% to 7% of sporadic cases are associated with germline pathogenic variants in the RET proto-oncogene.[68,69] Certain loss-of-function RET variants have been associated with isolated HSCR,[70] indicating that not all individuals with HSCR and a germline RET variant necessarily have MEN2A. Figure 2 depicts some of the classic manifestations of MEN2A in a family. Up to 50% of MEN2A cases are of the  FMTC subtype, and are defined as families or single individuals with germline RET pathogenic variants and MTC alone in the absence of
PHEO or parathyroid adenoma/hyperplasia.[1]  This definition replaces previous classification of FMTC as a stand-alone diagnosis.[1]  Previously, misclassification of families as having FMTC (because of too-small family size or later onset of other manifestations of  MEN2A) could result in overlooking the risk of PHEO, a disease with significant morbidity and mortality. For this reason, FMTC is now considered a subtype of MEN2A in which there is a lack of or delay in the onset of the other (nonthyroidal) manifestations of the MEN2A syndrome.[71]   Current management guidelines [1] recommend that patients thought to have pure FMTC also be screened for PHEO and hyperparathyroidism. MEN2B is clinically characterized by the presence of mucosal neuromas on the lips
and tongue, ganglioneuromatosis of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, medullated corneal nerve fibers, and distinctive facies which include the following:
enlarged lips, an asthenic Marfanoid body habitus, and MTC.[72-75]
In cases of de novo pathogenic variants, the diagnosis of MEN2B is often delayed, after the development of MTC.  The MTC is often fatal, particularly in the presence of metastatic disease, which is common at the time of diagnosis. It is important, therefore, for pediatricians to recognize the endocrine and nonendocrine clinical manifestations of the syndrome as an earlier diagnosis may result in lifesaving treatment of MTC, before metastatic spread.[76] The MEN2B subtype makes up about 5% of MEN2 cases.  The MEN2B subtype was
initially called mucosal neuroma syndrome or Wagenmann-Froboese syndrome.[77] 
MEN2B is characterized by the early development of an aggressive form of MTC
in all patients.[72]  Patients with MEN2B who do not undergo thyroidectomy
at an early age (at approximately age 1 y) are likely to develop metastatic MTC at
an early age.  Before intervention with early risk-reducing thyroidectomy, the
average age at death in patients with MEN2B was 21 years.  PHEOs
occur in about 50% of MEN2B cases; about half are multiple and often bilateral.
Clinically apparent parathyroid disease is very uncommon.[49,72] Patients with MEN2B may be identified in infancy or early childhood by a
distinctive facial appearance and the presence of mucosal neuromas on the
anterior dorsal surface of the tongue, palate, or pharynx.  The lips become
prominent over time, and submucosal nodules may be present on the vermilion
border of the lips.  Neuromas of the eyelids may cause thickening and eversion
of the upper eyelid margins.  Prominent thickened corneal nerves may be seen by
slit lamp examination. Patients with MEN2B may have diffuse ganglioneuromatosis of the gastrointestinal
tract with associated symptoms that include abdominal distension, megacolon,
constipation, and diarrhea.[78,79]
A review of the literature reported the presence of constipation as a common symptom in 72.7% of patients with MEN2B. Additionally, gastrointestinal symptoms occurred during the first year of life in 52.3% of patients with MEN2B. Intestinal biopsy led to the diagnosis of ganglioneuromatosis in 27.3% of patients.[80] About 75% of patients have a Marfanoid habitus, often with kyphoscoliosis or
lordosis, joint laxity, and decreased subcutaneous fat.  Proximal muscle
wasting and weakness can also be seen.[74,75] A retrospective review of the clinical presentation of 35 cases of MEN2B with de novo pathogenic variants treated at a single institution found that 22 cases were diagnosed because of endocrine manifestations of the syndrome.[76]  The diagnosis of PHEO, a neck mass, and/or skeletal abnormalities led to the identification of MTC.  The remaining 13 patients presented with a nonendocrine manifestation, including oral neuromas, corneal nerve abnormalities, persistent diarrhea, failure to thrive, or skeletal abnormalities with frequent falls.   Of the entire cohort, 21 patients had one or more physician referrals for the evaluation of an MEN2B-related feature, an average of 5 years before the diagnosis of MEN2B. It is critical for pediatricians and other providers who care for infants/children (e.g., gastroenterologists, pathologists, oral health care professionals) to maintain a high index of suspicion when evaluating patients with any of the clinical manifestations associated with MEN2B. In a child or infant, the presence of oral and ocular neuromas, GI manifestations (like severe constipation and/or the need for a rectal biopsy), and/or a tall, lanky appearance may warrant further investigation. The identification of these features may prompt an early diagnosis of MEN2B and the opportunity to prevent or cure a patient’s MTC.[79,81] Some authors have recommended referral to genetic counseling for an individual with MTC or any of the following features:[72,81,82] Benign oral and submucosal neuromas. Elongated face and large lips. Ganglioneuromatosis. Inability to cry tears (biologic mechanism unknown). MEN2 syndromes are the result of inherited pathogenic variants in the RET gene, located on
chromosome region 10q11.2.[83-85]  The RET gene is a proto-oncogene composed of 21
exons over 55 kilobase of genomic material.[86,87] RET encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase with extracellular, transmembrane, and
intracellular domains.  Details of RET receptor and ligand interaction in this signaling pathway have been reviewed.[32,88,89] Briefly, the extracellular domain consists of a calcium-binding
cadherin-like region and a cysteine-rich region  that interacts with one of four ligands identified to date.  These ligands, e.g., glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin, persephin, and artemin, also interact with one of  four coreceptors in the GDNF-family receptor–alpha family.[88]  The tyrosine kinase catalytic core is
located in the intracellular domain, which causes downstream signaling events
through a variety of second messenger molecules. MEN2 is a well-defined hereditary cancer syndrome. Genetic testing is an important management tool  for individuals and/or family members who are at risk for MEN2. The American Thyroid Association and NCCN  recommend that all patients with MTC consider genetic testing, even if they have other known risk factors that contribute to MTC.[1,23]  MEN2 meets the criteria related to indications for genetic testing for cancer susceptibility outlined by the American Society of Clinical Oncology.[90] At-risk individuals are defined as first-degree relatives
(parents, siblings, and children) of a person known to have MEN2.  Testing
can identify people with asymptomatic MEN2; these individuals can consider  
risk-reducing thyroidectomy and biochemical screening as preventive measures. 
A negative pathogenic variant analysis in at-risk relatives, however, is informative only after a disease-causing variant has been identified in an affected relative. For more information, see Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling. Because early detection of at-risk individuals affects medical management,
testing children without MEN2 symptoms can be beneficial.[91,92] For more information on clinical management of at-risk individuals, see the  Genotype-Phenotype Correlations and Risk Stratification section. Germline DNA testing for RET pathogenic variants is generally recommended to all individuals with a diagnosis of MTC, regardless of whether there is a personal or family history suggestive of MEN2.[93,94] Approximately 95% of patients with MEN2A or MEN2B will have an identifiable germline RET pathogenic variant.[95]  Between  1% and 10% of individuals with apparently sporadic MTC will carry a germline RET pathogenic variant, underscoring the importance of testing all  individuals diagnosed with MTC.[96-98] There is no evidence for the involvement of other genetic loci, and all pathogenic variant–negative families analyzed to date have demonstrated linkage to the RET gene. For families that do not have a detectable pathogenic variant, clinical recommendations can be based on the clinical features in the affected individual and in the family. There is considerable diversity in the techniques used and the approach to RET pathogenic variant testing among the various laboratories that perform this procedure. Methods used to detect variants in RET include
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products, heteroduplex analysis,
single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and DNA sequencing.[95,99]  Most testing laboratories, at a minimum, offer testing using a targeted exon approach; that is, the laboratories look for variants in the exons that are most commonly found to carry variants (exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16). Other laboratories offer testing of all RET exons. If targeted-exon testing in a family with a high clinical suspicion for MEN2 is normal, sequencing of the remaining exons can then be performed. Differences in variant detection methods are important to consider when selecting a genetic testing laboratory  and  interpreting the test results.  For more information on clinical validity, see   Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling. Genotype-phenotype correlations in MEN2 are well-established and have long been used to guide clinicians in making medical management recommendations. Several groups have developed pathogenic variant–stratification tables based on clinical phenotype, age of onset, and aggressiveness of MTC.[1,93,100] This classification strategy was first put forth after the Seventh International Workshop on MEN in 2001, which provided guidelines for the age of genetic testing and prophylactic thyroidectomy.[93] This stratification has been revised by the American Thyroid Association (ATA).[1,101,102] The specific pathogenic variants and their ATA classification are summarized in Table 5 below. ATA-Highest Risk (HST) (previously labeled ATA-D) pathogenic variants are the most aggressive and carry the highest risk of developing MTC.[1]  This category includes those with MEN2B and RET codon M918T pathogenic variants and is associated with the youngest age at disease onset and the highest risk of mortality. ATA-High Risk (H) (previously called ATA-C)  pathogenic variants, at codons 634 and A883F, are associated with a slightly lower risk, yet the MTC in patients with these pathogenic variants is still quite aggressive and may present at an early age.[103]  Former ATA-levels A and B pathogenic variants are now combined into a single group called Moderate Risk (MOD) and are associated with a lower risk of aggressive MTC relative to the risk seen in carriers of ATA-HST and ATA-H pathogenic variants.[102] Results from a study of 387 RET pathogenic variant carriers with MTC have suggested that ATA-MOD variants may be associated with MTC as aggressive as seen in individuals with ATA-H variants but present at a later age.[104] The risk of MTC is still substantially elevated over the general population risk and consideration of risk-reducing thyroidectomy is warranted.[1] Patients with early stage I and stage II disease can achieve 100% survival rates regardless of the ATA risk category.[104]  Common pathogenic variants in the ATA-MOD category are shown in Table 5. Pathogenic variants at codons 883 and 918 have been seen only in MEN2B and are associated with the earliest age of onset and the most aggressive form of MTC.[103,105-109] Approximately 95% of individuals with MEN2B will have the M918T pathogenic variant.[105-107,110] As discussed above, 50% of individuals with MEN2B will develop PHEO but PHPT is rare. A retrospective review of all published cases of A883F variant carriers (N = 13) found that the MTC disease course was more indolent than what was observed in M918T carriers. A883F carriers had later disease onset (50% penetrance for MTC at age 19 y), 5- and 10-year survival rates of 88%, and 63% of patients achieved biochemical cure for MTC.[103]  In addition to variants at codons 883 and 918, some individuals with an MEN2B-like phenotype have been found to carry two germline variants.[111-115] It is likely that as testing for RET becomes more common in clinical practice, additional double variant phenotypes will be described. Pathogenic variants at codon 634 (ATA-H) are by far the most frequent finding in families with MEN2A. One study of 477 RET carriers showed that 52.1% had the C634R pathogenic variant, 26.0% carried the C634Y pathogenic variant, and 9.1% had the C634G pathogenic variant.[49] In general, pathogenic variants at codon 634 are associated with PHEOs and PHPT.[49,116] Until recently, MEN2A with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis had been seen almost exclusively in patients with pathogenic variants at codon 634.[49,51,117] However, a recent report described MTC and cutaneous lichen amyloidosis  in an individual previously thought to have FMTC due to a codon 804 pathogenic variant.[118] Codon 634 pathogenic variants have also been described in FMTC but are almost exclusively C634Y.[49] In summary, ATA-HST and ATA-H (previously levels D and C, respectively) pathogenic variants confer the highest risk of MTC (about 95% lifetime risk) with a more aggressive disease course. There is an increased risk of PHEO (up to 50%).[49,119]  Individuals with codon 634 pathogenic variants (but not codon 883 or 918 variants) also have an increased risk of PHPT.[49] Moderate-risk variants located in exon 10 of the RET gene include variants at codons 609, 611, 618, 620, and 630. These variants involve cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of the RET protein and have been seen in families with MEN2A and those with MTC only (FMTC).[21,49,100,120-124] The risk of MTC in individuals with these pathogenic variants is approximately 95% to 100%; the risk of PHEO and hyperparathyroidism is lower than that seen in individuals with high-risk  pathogenic variants. Individuals with  pathogenic variants previously classified as ATA-level A (now classified with ATA-level B as ATA-MOD, i.e., codons 321, 515, 533, 600, 603, 606, 531/9 base pair duplication, and 532 duplication)  have a lower, albeit still elevated, lifetime risk of MTC. MTC associated with these pathogenic variants tends to follow a more indolent course and have a later age at onset, although there are several reports of individuals with these pathogenic variants who developed MTC before age 20 years.[49,125-129] Although PHEO and PHPT are not commonly associated with these pathogenic variants, they have been described.[129] In addition to the pathogenic variants categorized in Table 5, a number of rare or novel RET variants have been described. Some of these represent pathogenic variants that lead to  MEN2A phenotypes. Others may represent low-penetrance alleles or modifying alleles that confer only a modest risk of developing MTC.[130] A multicenter study identified eight families with a RET K666N variant.  Of the 16 screened family members identified as having a pathogenic variant, only one had MTC.[130] Still others may be benign polymorphisms of no clinical significance. For example, some studies show compelling evidence that RET variants Y791F (p.Tyr791Phe) and S649L (p.Ser649Leu) are likely benign polymorphisms; this was based on the equal frequencies seen between cases and healthy controls and co-occurrence with other disease-causing variants that cosegregate with disease in the family.[131,132] A long-term follow-up study of Danish Y791F carriers (n = 20) showed no sign of MEN2A (MTC, PHPT, PHEO, cutaneous lichen amyloidosis, or HSCR) among the cohort, with a median age of 49.5 years (range, 7–87 y).[133] Therefore, carriers of these variants are not followed with MEN2 management guidelines; asymptomatic family members are generally not tested for these variants. Comprehensive testing of all hotspot variants in exon 8 and exons 10–16 may be performed to rule out any other RET pathogenic variants. However, a PHEO diagnosis may warrant extensive testing of other disease-related genes. For more information, see the  Familial Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma Syndrome section. Research is ongoing into the role of neutral RET sequence variants in modifying the clinical presentation of patients with MEN2A.  The presence of certain RET polymorphisms or haplotypes is being analyzed for its impact on the likelihood for development of PHEO, hyperparathyroidism, HSCR, and age at onset of metastatic involvement with MTC.[134-137]   A variety of approaches, including segregation analyses, in silico analyses, association studies, and functional assays, can be employed to determine the functional and clinical significance of a given genetic variant. A publicly available RET variant online database repository was developed  and includes a complete list of variants and their associated pathogenicity, phenotype, and other associated clinical information and literature references.[138] The presence of a functioning PHEO can be excluded by
appropriate biochemical screening before thyroidectomy in any patient with MEN2A or MEN2B.  However, childhood PHEOs are rare in MEN2.[1] The ATA recommends that annual screening for PHEO be considered by age 11 years in patients with ATA-HST or ATA-H RET pathogenic variants.[1]   The ATA recommends that patients with ATA-MOD RET pathogenic variants  have periodic screening for PHEO beginning by age 16 years.[1] MRI or other imaging tests may be ordered only if the biochemical results are abnormal.[27,139]  Studies of individuals with sporadic or hereditary PHEO (including, but not limited to, individuals with MEN2) have suggested that measurement of catecholamine metabolites, specifically plasma-free metanephrines and/or urinary fractionated metanephrines, provides a higher diagnostic sensitivity than urinary catecholamines because of the episodic nature of catecholamine excretion.[33-39,140] Several reviews provide a succinct summary of the biochemical diagnosis, localization, and management of PHEO.[39,141] In addition to surgery, there are other clinical situations in which patients with catecholamine excess face special risk.  An example is the healthy at-risk female patient who becomes pregnant.  Pregnancy, labor, or delivery may precipitate a hypertensive crisis in individuals who have an unrecognized PHEO.  Pregnant patients who are found to have catecholamine excess require appropriate pharmacotherapy before delivery. Level of evidence: 5 MEN2-related hyperparathyroidism is generally associated with mild, often asymptomatic hypercalcemia early in the natural history of the disease, which,  left untreated, may become symptomatic.[60] Childhood hyperparathyroidism is rare in MEN2. Three studies found the median age at diagnosis was about 38 years.[60,142,143] The ATA provides recommendations for annual screening for hyperparathyroidism,[1] with screening beginning by age 11 years in carriers of ATA-HST and ATA-H pathogenic variants and by age 16 years for carriers of ATA-MOD  RET pathogenic variants.[1] Testing typically includes albumin-corrected calcium or ionized serum calcium with or without intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurement. Level of evidence: 5 Risk-reducing thyroidectomy is not routinely offered  to at-risk
individuals unless MEN2A is confirmed.  The screening
protocol for MTC in patients with MEN2A is annual calcitonin stimulation test; however, caution
must be used in interpreting test results because CCH that
is not a precursor to MTC occurs in about 5% of the population.[13,14,144]  In addition, there is significant risk of false-negative test results in patients younger than 15 years.[14] Screening
for PHEO and parathyroid disease is the same as described above. For patients at risk of FMTC, annual screening for MTC is the same as for patients with MEN2A. Level of evidence: 5 Risk-reducing thyroidectomy (also  referred to as early thyroidectomy and previously referred to as prophylactic thyroidectomy) is the oncologic treatment of choice for patients with MEN2. Children with the M918T RET pathogenic variant may benefit from a thyroidectomy in the first year of life, perhaps in the first months of life.[1] Likewise, children with ATA-H category RET pathogenic variants may undergo prophylactic thyroidectomy at age 5 years or earlier, on the basis of serum calcitonin levels. The ATA recommends that children in the ATA-MOD category have a physical examination, ultrasonography of the neck, and measurement of the serum calcitonin beginning around age 5 years as these tumors may have later onset but are similarly aggressive once this is taken into account.[1,102] The absence of an abnormal calcitonin level may prompt continued measurement every 6 to 12 months. A multidisciplinary team caring for the patient, including the pediatrician, pediatric endocrinologist, and surgeon should determine the timing of surgery in conjunction with the child’s parents on the basis of the trend in serum calcitonin levels, ultrasonographic findings, preference of the family, and experience of the treating physicians.[1] In children with some ATA-H or ATA-MOD RET pathogenic variants, some studies have suggested that basal and pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin levels could be used to determine the timing of total thyroidectomy.[145-148] These findings suggest that surgery may be safely delayed in carriers of an RET pathogenic variant until basal or stimulated calcitonin levels increase on routine testing. The benefits of this approach are particularly noteworthy in the younger population of pathogenic variant carriers, as a delay in surgery until the patient is older may reduce the risk of surgical complications. A large study of 2,740 children aged 16 years and under has provided data on age-specific reference ranges for calcitonin levels in younger children that may assist in decision making.[149]  Because some calcitonin assays may be more sensitive than others,[147]  attention to the type of testing, as well as calcitonin levels will need to be considered. However, normal preoperative basal calcitonin does not exclude the possibility of the patient having MTC.[150] For patients with RET germline variants, older age at prophylactic thyroidectomy has been significantly associated with a higher risk of postoperative persistent or recurrent disease.[151] Consistent with this, a study of young, clinically asymptomatic individuals with MEN2A showed there was a lower incidence of persistent or recurrent disease in patients who had thyroidectomy earlier in life (defined as younger than age 8 y) and who had no evidence of lymph node metastases.[152] Several studies have shown that there is a significantly lower rate of invasive or metastatic MTC among those who undergo surgery at an earlier age than among those who undergo surgery at a later age.[153] For patients with the most aggressive M918T RET variant, cure is exceptional if surgery is performed after age 4 years.[145,154] Together, these findings are consistent with more favorable outcomes for patients undergoing risk-reducing thyroidectomy at a young age.[155] Although thyroidectomy before biochemical evidence of disease (normal preoperative calcitonin) may reduce the risk of recurrent disease, a selective strategy for postoperative and lifelong surveillance might depend on the final pathologic determination of whether a carcinoma was present and whether it was micromedullary or macromedullary.[1,156] One study found that 10% of patients with MEN2A undergoing thyroidectomy developed recurrent disease, on the basis of initially undetectable basal and stimulated calcitonin levels (<2 pg/mL) that became positive 5 to 10 years after surgery.[152] Only 2% of patients had residual disease after prophylactic surgery as assessed by a persistently elevated basal or stimulated calcitonin.[152] Questions remain concerning the natural history of MEN2. As more information is acquired, recommendations regarding the optimal age for thyroidectomy and the potential role for genetics and biochemical screening may change. Earliest reports of MTC in MEN2B before age 3 years, and before age 6 years in MEN2A cases with ATA-H or ATA-MOD RET variants have been documented.[145,152,154,157] Conversely, another case report documented onset of cancer in midlife or later in some families with the FMTC subtype of MEN2A and in elderly relatives who carry the RET variant genotype but have not developed cancer.[158] Subsequent data have suggested that some ATA-MOD RET variants, which were previously thought of as more indolent may be as aggressive as ATA-H variants, but are associated with delayed onset of disease.[102,104] Emerging data pertaining to the timing of disease onset and local metastases by risk category are evolving.[104]  These clinical observations suggest that the natural history of the MEN2 syndromes is variable and could be subject to modifying effects related to specific RET pathogenic variants, other genes, behavioral factors, or environmental exposures. Level of evidence: 4b The standard treatment for adults with MTC is surgical removal of the entire thyroid gland, including the posterior capsule and central lymph node dissection.[1]  A therapeutic central neck dissection is typically performed if there is radiographic evidence of metastatic lymph node involvement or if the serum calcitonin level is higher than 40 pg/mL.[1]  The decision to perform a prophylactic central neck dissection is generally made on the basis of multiple factors such as patient age, pathogenic  variant, presence of concomitant PHPT, and the vascularity of the parathyroid glands.[1] Selective autotransplantation of parathyroid glands that were devascularized during a prophylactic thyroidectomy and/or central neck clearance is recommended. A selective approach also significantly reduces the detrimental outcome of hypoparathyroidism.[159] The MEN2B RET variant M918T is associated with approximately 100% incidence of MTC in the first years of life [154] and is considered the most aggressive MEN2 phenotype. In patients with MEN2A, the ATA-H high-risk codon 634 pathogenic variant is much more likely to be associated with invasive or metastatic MTC and development of persistent or recurrent disease than pathogenic variants in codons 804, 618, or 620.[153]  One series of 503 at-risk individuals with ATA-MOD category pathogenic variants (including codons 533, 609, 611, 618, 620, 791, and 804) reported cumulative penetrance rates, median time to MTC, and positive predictive value of preoperative calcitonin.[146] The risk of developing MTC by age 50 years ranged from 18% to 95%, depending on the codon, with codon 620 having the highest penetrance. Most patients with MTC had node-negative disease, confirming the more indolent disease course that had been previously reported with these pathogenic variants. Although an elevated preoperative calcitonin level strongly predicted the presence of MTC, relatively high false-negative rates (low normal calcitonin levels with MTC) were noted for many of the codons. This information is useful when counseling carriers of pathogenic variants regarding the extent of surgical resection. The ATA recommends compartment-directed lymph node dissection for local or regional disease (no evidence of distant metastases) in the following situations:[1] If there is no evidence of neck nodal metastases by ultrasonography in biopsy-proven thyroid disease, prophylactic central neck dissection should be performed concomitant with initial thyroidectomy. If nodal disease is present in either the  central or lateral neck, a  compartment-oriented lateral neck dissection of the ipsilateral side should be performed. If nodal disease is present and basal calcitonin levels are greater than 200 pg/mL, then consider contralateral lateral neck dissection. Although basal calcitonin levels may not be able to identify all patients with MTC preoperatively, this test has utility as a predictor of postoperative remission, lymph node metastases, and distant metastases.[160] In one study of 224 patients from a single institution, preoperative basal calcitonin levels greater than 500 pg/mL predicted failure to achieve biochemical remission.[160] The authors of this study found that nodal metastases started appearing at basal calcitonin levels of 40 pg/mL (normal, <10 pg/mL). In node-positive patients, distant metastases emerged at basal calcitonin levels of 150 pg/mL to 400 pg/mL. Another study of 308 RET pathogenic variant carriers found that a normal basal preoperative calcitonin excluded the presence of lymph node metastases (negative predictive value, 100%).[148] Therefore, the preoperative basal calcitonin level is a useful prognostic indicator and may help guide the surgical approach. With regard to prognosis, structural and metastatic disease recurrence is common in germline RET pathogenic variant carriers and can happen up to 20 years after initial treatment. Despite this, overall survival (OS) is generally favorable, with one study citing an OS rate of 92% at 10 years.[161] Patients who have had total thyroidectomy will require lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The dosing of medication is age-dependent, and treatment may be initiated on the basis of ideal body weight. For healthy adults aged 60 years and younger with no cardiac disease, a reasonable starting dose is 1.6 µg/kg to 1.8 µg/kg given once daily.[162] Older patients may require 20% to 30% less thyroid hormone.[163] Children metabolize T4 more rapidly than adults and consequently require relatively higher replacement by body weight. Depending on the age of the child, replacement is typically between 2 µg/kg to 6 µg/kg.[164] It is important to note, however, that replacement is preferred over suppressive therapy. Since C-cell tumors are not thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)–dependent for growth, the T4 therapy for patients with MTC therefore may be adjusted to maintain a TSH within the normal reference range. Thyroglobulin measurement may also be useful for adjusting and maintaining TSH levels within a normal reference range to prevent additional regrowth of remnant thyroid tissue.[165] Level of evidence (central neck dissection): 5 Level of evidence (hormone replacement therapy): 3c Level of evidence (therapeutic thyroidectomy): 4 Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are generally not effective against
MTC.[4,166,167] Hence, targeted molecular therapies are being explored to manage MTC. RET inhibitors and multikinase inhibitors are being used to block RET activity. There are two U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved RET inhibitors (pralsetinib and selpercatinib) that are now available for patients with MTC who have a RET point mutation. These RET inhibitors are also available for patients who have differentiated thyroid cancers with a RET fusion. A multicenter, phase I/II trial (ARROW) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of pralsetinib in patients with RET-mutant MTC with or without prior treatment with vandetanib or cabozantinib. Among 55 patients who were previously treated with a multikinase inhibitor, the overall response rate was 60% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46%–73%) and 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 75% (95% CI, 63%–86%). Among 21 treatment-naïve patients, the overall response rate was 71% (95% CI, 48%–89%) and the 1-year PFS rate was 81% (95% CI, 63%–98%).[168] A similar phase I/II trial (LIBRETTO) examined the efficacy of selpercatinib in patients with RET-mutant MTC with or without prior treatment with vandetanib or cabozantinib. Among 55 patients who were previously treated with a multikinase inhibitor, 69% had an objective response (95% CI, 55%–81%); the 1-year PFS rate was 82% (95% CI, 69%–90%). Among 88  treatment-naïve patients, the objective response rate was 73% (95% CI, 62%–82%) and the 1-year PFS rate was 92% (95% CI, 82%–97%).[169] The use of vandetanib and cabozantinib is approved by the  U.S. Food and Drug Administration for adult patients with progressive metastatic MTC who are ineligible for surgery.  A phase III study found that progression-free survival (PFS) was longer in adults who received vandetanib than in those who received placebo.[170]  A phase I/phase II study of children with MEN2B found an objective partial response rate of 47% with vandetanib.[171] Subsequent follow-up analysis of this cohort revealed that a partial response was seen in 10 of 17 patients; stable disease was seen in an additional 6 individuals.  Median PFS was 6.7 years.[172] A double-blind phase III trial that compared cabozantinib with placebo in 330 patients with progressive MTC showed an improvement in median PFS across all subgroups.[173,174] In this trial, patients who had pathogenic variants, including RET or RAS, were more likely to have a prolonged PFS compared with patients lacking both pathogenic variants.[175] Prospective studies may further clarify whether particular pathogenic variants can be used to guide therapy. Neither cabozantinib nor vandetanib has demonstrated improved OS.[170,173,174] Importantly, these agents are not effective at inhibiting some MEN2 RET variants, specifically those at codon 804,[176] making genotype an important consideration for treatment with RET inhibitors. Further, a 2018 study has demonstrated the development of resistance to these agents through somatic acquisition of a V804M mutation in RET.[177]  Finally, multikinase inhibitors are associated with significant toxicities, possibly due to their off-target effects on other kinases.[178]  Other multikinase inhibitors for targeting RET are being studied in clinical trials; however, they may only provide limited advantages over vandetanib and cabozantinib. For these reasons, ongoing studies are focusing on the development of selective RET inhibitors with fewer off-target effects that are able to block the activity of all RET variant forms and the use of combination therapy in MTC. Future studies will likely focus on the development of new targeted therapies and the use of combination therapy in MTC.[179,180] Level of evidence (pralsetinib): 4 Level of evidence (selpercatinib): 3dii Level of evidence (vandetanib): 2 Level of evidence (cabozantinib): 1 For more information, see   Thyroid Cancer Treatment. A cognitive shift has occurred in the field regarding the risks and benefits of whole organ resection. This is especially relevant for endocrine glands that are difficult to manage postresection and may require replacement therapy. PHEO may be either unilateral or bilateral in patients with MEN2.  Laparoscopic adrenalectomy (anterior or posterior) is the recommended approach after appropriate preoperative medical blockade for the treatment of unilateral PHEO.[1,93,101,181] The risks, benefits, and potential of life-threatening adrenal insufficiency should be considered at the time of the initial operative planning. If disease appears unilateral, the contralateral gland may develop metachronous disease in 17% to 72% of patients.[6,182]
 In a series of RET p.Cys634 variant carriers, only 1 in 5 developed a  second ipsilateral PHEO after a follow-up period of 8 to 11 years when the cortical preservation technique was used. This technique allows patients to continue making steroid hormones on their own, which makes it a viable surgical option.[183] In one series, 23 patients with a unilateral PHEO and a macroscopically normal contralateral adrenal gland were treated initially with unilateral adrenalectomy.[184] A PHEO developed within the retained gland in 12 (52%) of these patients, occurring a mean of 11.9 years after initial surgery. During follow-up, no patient experienced a hypertensive crisis or other problems attributable to an undiagnosed PHEO. In contrast, 10 of 43 patients (23%) treated with bilateral adrenalectomy experienced at least one episode of acute adrenal insufficiency. Thus, unilateral adrenalectomy is a reasonable management strategy for unilateral PHEO in patients with MEN2.[1,185,186] Many experts suggest considering a cortical-sparing technique for a suspected unilateral PHEO, even if it is the patient's first operation.[1,187] For more information, see the section on Interventions in the Familial Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma Syndrome section.  Because of the risk of contralateral gland disease, periodic surveillance (serum or urinary catecholamine measurements) for the development of disease in the contralateral adrenal gland is recommended.[1] Regarding the operative approach, several studies examined the value of a posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy and found it to be safe and effective, with very low mortality and a low rate of minor complications, and conversion to open surgery required rarely.[182,188-194] Level of evidence: 4 Most patients with MEN2-related parathyroid disease are either asymptomatic or diagnosed incidentally in the preoperative planning or at the time of thyroidectomy.  Typically, the hypercalcemia (when present) is mild, although it may be associated with increased urinary excretion of calcium and nephrolithiasis.  As a consequence, the indications for surgical intervention are generally similar to those recommended for patients with sporadic PHPT.[93] In general, fewer than four of the parathyroid glands are involved at the time of detected abnormalities in calcium metabolism.[1] Treatment of hyperparathyroidism typically employs some extent of surgical removal of the involved glands.  Cure of hyperparathyroidism was achieved surgically in 89% of one large series of patients;[60] however, 22% of resected patients in this study developed postoperative hypoparathyroidism. Five patients (9%) had recurrent hyperparathyroidism.  This series employed various surgical techniques, including total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation to the nondominant forearm (4 of 11  patients [36%] developed postoperative hypoparathyroidism), subtotal parathyroidectomy (6 of 12 patients [50%] developed hypoparathyroidism), and resection only of glands that were macroscopically enlarged (3 of 29  patients [10%] developed hypoparathyroidism).  These data indicate that excision of only those parathyroid glands that are enlarged appears to be sufficient therapy in most cases. Some investigators have suggested using the MEN2 subtype  to decide where to place the parathyroid glands that are identified at the time of thyroid surgery.  For patients with MEN2B in whom the risk of parathyroid disease is quite low, the parathyroid glands may be left in situ in the neck.  For adult patients with MEN2A, in whom the glands have been inadvertently devascularized during primary surgical treatment for MTC, it is suggested that the glands needing reimplantation be implanted in the nondominant forearm. This approach minimizes the need for further surgical intervention in the neck should hyperparathyroidism develop or recur.[1,159,195,196] For children, the risk/benefit ratio must be carefully weighed to avoid overtreatment and subsequent aparathyroidism.[197] It is important to confirm that the remnant or autotransplanted parathyroid tissue is functional.[1,101,198,199] Medical therapy of hyperparathyroidism has gained popularity with the advent of calcimimetics, agents that sensitize the calcium-sensing receptors on the parathyroid glands to circulating calcium levels and thereby reduce circulating PTH levels.  In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, cinacalcet hydrochloride was shown to induce sustained reduction in circulating calcium and PTH levels in patients with PHPT.[200]  In patients who are high-risk surgical candidates, those with recurrent hyperparathyroidism, or those in whom life expectancy is limited, medical therapy may be a viable alternative to a surgical approach.[1] Consequences of long-term therapy with cinacalcet are unknown. Level of evidence: 5 All of the MEN2 subtypes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.  For the
child of someone with MEN2, the risk of inheriting the MEN2 pathogenic variant is 50%. 
Some individuals with MEN2, however, carry a de novo pathogenic variant; that is, they
carry a new pathogenic variant that was not present in previous generations of their
family and thus do not have an affected parent.  The proportion of individuals
with MEN2 who have an affected parent varies by subtype. MEN2A:  About 95% of affected individuals have an affected parent. It is
appropriate to evaluate the parents of an individual with MEN2A for
manifestations of the disorder.  In the 5% of cases that are not familial,
either de novo pathogenic variants or incomplete penetrance of the mutant allele is
possible.[201] FMTC:  Multiple family members are affected; therefore, all affected individuals
 inherited the mutant gene from a parent. MEN2B:  About 50% of affected individuals have de novo RET gene pathogenic variants, and 50%
have inherited the pathogenic variant from a parent.[202,203]  The majority of de novo
pathogenic variants are paternal in origin, but cases of maternal origin have been
reported.[204] Siblings of a proband:  The risk to siblings depends on the genetic status of the
parent, which can be clarified by pedigree analysis and/or DNA-based testing. 
In situations of apparent de novo pathogenic variants, germline mosaicism in an
apparently unaffected parent must be considered, even though such an
occurrence has not yet been reported. One study explored the attitudes of individuals with MEN1 and MEN2 toward preimplantation genetic testing (PGT).[205]  Ninety-one clinic-based patients from a single U.S. institution who had MEN1 and an MEN1 pathogenic variant or MEN2 and a RET pathogenic variant were surveyed.   The study found that 30% (10 of 33) of those with MEN1 and 37% (21 of 57) of those with MEN2 were aware of PGT; 82% (27 of 33) of those with MEN1 and 61% (34 of 56) of those with MEN2 thought PGT should be offered; and 61% (19 of 31) of those with MEN1 and 43% (23 of 54) of those with MEN2 would consider PGT. The psychosocial impact of genetic testing for pathogenic variants in RET has not been extensively studied. 
 Published studies have had limitations such as small sample size and heterogeneous populations; thus, the clinical relevance of these findings should be interpreted with caution.  Identification as the carrier of a pathogenic variant may affect self-esteem, family relationships, and quality of life.[206]  In addition, misconceptions about genetic disease may result in familial blame and guilt.[207,208] Several review articles outline both the medical and psychological issues,
especially those related to the testing of children.[209-212]   The medical value
of early screening and risk-reducing treatment are contrasted with the loss of
decision-making autonomy for the individual.  Lack of agreement between parents
about the value and timing of genetic testing and surgery may spur the
development of emotional problems within the family. One study examined levels of psychological distress in the interval between submitting a blood sample and receiving genetic test results. Those individuals who experienced the highest level of distress were younger than 25 years, single, and had a history of responding to distressful situations with anxiety.[213] Pathogenic variant–positive parents whose children received negative test results did not seem to be reassured, questioned the reliability of the DNA test, and were eager to continue screening of their noncarrier children.[214] A small qualitative study (N = 21) evaluated how patients with MEN2A and family members conceptualized participation in lifelong high-risk surveillance.[215]   Ongoing surveillance was viewed as a reminder of a health threat.  Acceptance and incorporation of lifelong surveillance into routine health care was essential for coping with the implications of this condition. Concern about genetic predisposition to cancer was peripheral to concerns about surveillance. Supportive interventions, such as Internet discussion forums, can serve as an ongoing means of  addressing informational and support needs of patients with MTC undergoing lifelong surveillance.[216] Wells SA, Asa SL, Dralle H, et al.: Revised American Thyroid Association guidelines for the management of medullary thyroid carcinoma.

The most common phenotype of the 19 established cases of MEN4 that have been described to date is primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), followed by pituitary adenomas.  MEN4 is caused by germline pathogenic variants in the tumor suppressor gene CDKN1B (12p13.1).[1]  This syndrome was discovered initially in rats (MENX) [2] and later in humans (MEN4).  The syndrome has the phenotype of being multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)-like. The incidence of CDKN1B variants in patients with an MEN1-related phenotype is difficult to estimate, but it is likely to be in the range of 1.5% to 3.7%.[3-5] Pathogenic variants leading to the MEN4 phenotype are transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. PHPT due to parathyroid neoplasia affects approximately 80%  of the reported cases of MEN4. PHPT occurs at a later age in MEN4 than in MEN1 (mean age ~56  y vs. ~25  y, respectively), with a female predominance.[6]  There have been no reports of PHPT recurrence after surgical resection, which might indicate that PHPT in MEN4 represents an overall milder disease spectrum than in MEN1. Pituitary involvement in MEN4 is the second most common manifestation of the disease, affecting approximately 37% of the reported cases. Pituitary adenomas in MEN4 vary and include nonfunctional, somatotropinoma, prolactinoma, or corticotropinoma types. The age at diagnosis for these lesions also varies widely, from 30 years to 79  years.  The youngest patient reported to have MEN4 presented at age 30 years with acromegaly.[2] Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have been rare, with only a few cases reported.  These include duodenopancreatic or gastrointestinal NETs that could be nonfunctioning or hormonally active and may secrete several substances, including gastrin, insulin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. Although adrenal neoplasia is a frequent finding in MEN1, only one case of nonfunctional bilateral adrenal nodules has been reported in MEN4.[5] Skin manifestations that are commonly reported in MEN1, such as lipomas, angiofibromas, and collagenomas, have not been reported in MEN4. There is no known genotype-phenotype correlation. The CDKN1B variant codes for p27Kip1 (commonly referred to as p27 or KIP1), a putative tumor suppressor gene that regulates cell cycle progression.  Alterations in this gene lead to a decrease in expression of p27 protein, triggering uncontrolled cell cycle progression. Although the loss of one allele of p27 is a frequent event in many human cancers, the remaining allele is rarely mutated or lost by loss of heterozygosity in human cancers.[7] Somatic mutations or germline pathogenic variants in CDKN1B have also been identified in patients with sporadic PHPT, small intestinal NETs, lymphoma, and breast cancer.  These findings demonstrate a novel role for CDKN1B as a tumor susceptibility gene in other neoplasms.[8-10] To date, only 19 cases having CDKN1B germline variants have been reported in the medical literature.[8]  Thirteen pathogenic germline variants that have been frameshift, nonsense, or missense variants have been described.[11,12] Index cases or individuals with MEN1-like features and negative results of MEN1 genetic testing are offered genetic counseling and testing for MEN4.  Confirmation of an MEN4 diagnosis is only made with genetic testing for CDKN1B variants.  In clinical practice, patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic PHPT who are also young (typically <30 y) and have multigland disease, parathyroid carcinoma, or atypical adenoma, or those with a family history or evidence of syndromic disease and negative for MEN1 or RET, are candidates for genetic testing for CDKN1B using accredited laboratories.[8] For those with proven disease, screening is also offered to a first-degree relative with or without MEN1 features. The identification of a germline CDKN1B variant should prompt periodic clinical biochemical screening for MEN4. Surveillance of CDKN1B pathogenic variant carriers should be performed, though guidelines have not been established yet.[8,13] Currently, surveillance is mainly clinical and focuses on  finding an excess of growth hormone. It is recommended that annual biochemical testing  for insulin-like growth factor-1 and annual blood work  be done to assess for PHPT.[13] For known CDKN1B carriers, surveillance begins at adolescence. The role of imaging has not been established. Similar to the treatment used in other familial syndromes, surgical treatment is recommended for parathyroid and pituitary disease. For more information, see the MEN1 section. A study of 293 MEN1 pathogenic variant–positive cases and 30 MEN1 pathogenic variant–negative cases, all with the MEN1 phenotype, showed that the pathogenic variant–negative cohort developed disease manifestations later in life, with improved life expectancy.[14]  One of the limitations in applying this finding to MEN4 is that only 1 of these 30 MEN1-negative patients was CDKN1B positive.

Individuals may present with secondary hypertension. In 2004, the World Health Organization characterized adrenal gland tumors as PHEOs.[1]  The term paraganglioma is reserved for non-adrenal (or extra-adrenal) neoplasms and may arise in various sites from the paraganglia along the parasympathetic nerves or the sympathetic trunk.  PGLs may be found in the head and neck region, abdomen, or pelvis.  Only those arising from sympathetic neural chains have secretory capacity. PGLs found in the skull base or head and neck region typically arise in the glomus cells, near the carotid body, along the vagal nerve or jugular fosse, and are usually from parasympathetic paraganglia and therefore rarely secrete catecholamines.[2,3]  The most recognizable tumors are found at the carotid body.  PGLs below the neck are most commonly located in the upper mediastinum or the urinary bladder.[3]  The reported incidence of these tumors in the general population is variable because they may be asymptomatic but ranges from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 100,000 individuals.[3] One autopsy study found a much greater incidence of 1 in 2,000 individuals, suggesting a high frequency of occult tumors.[4]    PGLs have an equal sex distribution. They can occur at any age but have the highest incidence between the ages of 40 and 50 years.[5,6] PHEOs and PGLs may occur sporadically, as manifestations of a hereditary syndrome, or as the sole tumor in one of several hereditary PHEO/PGL syndromes.   Some individuals with a predisposition to PHEOs/PGLs do not have a known family history of these tumors. For example, a study of 108 patients with PHEOs/PGLs found that 33% of patients with a germline pathogenic variant did not have family histories of a  hereditary PHEO/PGL syndrome. Similarly,  36% of the patients with SDHB germline pathogenic variants did not have  family histories of PHEOs/PGLs or personal histories of PHEOs/PGLs at presentation.[7] Most sporadic PHEOs occur unilaterally. Bilateral PHEOs are more likely to occur in a hereditary condition. A single-center study of patients with PHEOs found that up to 7% of adults and 37.5% of children had bilateral PHEOs.  Synchronous tumors were seen in 80% of patients with bilateral PHEOs. When metachronous PHEOs were identified, the median time to develop a second PHEO was 4.5 years (range 1–38 y). Hereditary cancer syndromes were  identified in 80% of individuals with bilateral PHEOs. These syndromes  included multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) (found in 42.6% of patients), von Hippel-Lindau Disease (VHL) (found in 19.1% of patients), MEN2B (found in 9.6% of patients), and neurofibromatosis type 1  (found in 8.5%  of patients).[8] In another retrospective series that spanned nearly 50 years, 15 of  49 patients (30%) who presented with a unilateral PHEO and  had unilateral total adrenalectomy developed a PHEO in the contralateral adrenal gland. This occurred  at a median period of 8.2 years after a patient's initial diagnosis (range, 1–20 y).[9] Of the 15 patients who developed PHEOs in the contralateral adrenal gland, 8 had MEN2A, 2 had MEN2B, 2 had VHL, and 1 had a familial PHEO. The risk of developing a contralateral PHEO increased over time. Twenty-five percent  of patients developed PHEOs after a median period of 6 years, and 43% of patients developed PHEOs after a median period of 32 years. PGLs and PHEOs are typically slow-growing tumors, and some may be present for many years before coming to clinical attention.  A minority of these tumors are malignant and present with an aggressive clinical course. PGL and PHEO malignancy is defined by the presence of metastases at sites distant from the primary tumor in nonchromaffin tissue.  Common sites of metastases include the bone, liver, and lungs.[1,10,11] There are a lack of reliable molecular, immunohistochemical, and genetic predictors that  distinguish between benign and malignant tumors.[12] However, in some studies, multivariate analysis indicates that certain factors lead to a higher malignancy rate (up to 70% in one study).[13] These factors include the following: an SDHB pathogenic variant,[14,15] young patient age,[13,15] extra-adrenal tumors,[15] and large tumors.[16] Some experts view local invasion into surrounding tissue as an additional marker of malignancy.[11,17,18]  Others have disagreed with this classification because locally invasive tumors tend to follow a more indolent course than tumors with distant metastatic involvement.[19-23]  Consequently, it is difficult to estimate the rate of malignancy in patients with PGLs. Studies have reported malignancy rates that range from 5% to 20%. Certain gene-specific malignancy estimates may be higher or lower than these percentages.[24] A PGL may cause a variety of symptoms depending on the location of the tumor and whether the tumor has secretory capacity.  PGLs of the head and neck are rarely associated with elevated catecholamines.  Secretory  PGLs and PHEOs may cause hypertension, headache, tachycardia, sweating, and flushing.    Typically, nonsecretory tumors are painless, coming to attention only when growth of the lesion into surrounding structures causes a mass effect.  Patients with a head or neck PGL may present with an enlarging lateral neck mass, hoarseness, Horner syndrome, pulsatile tinnitus, dizziness, facial droop, or blurred vision.[25] Patients with clinically apparent catecholamine excess generally undergo biochemical testing to evaluate the secretory capacity of the tumor(s).[26] This evaluation is best performed by measuring urine and/or plasma fractionated metanephrines (normetanephrine and metanephrine), which yields a higher sensitivity and specificity than directly measuring catecholamines (norepinephrine, dopamine, and epinephrine).[27] For patients whose plasma metanephrines levels are measured, blood is collected after an intravenous catheter has been inserted and the patient has been in a supine position for 15 to 20 minutes.[28] Additionally, the patient should not have food or caffeinated beverages, smoke cigarettes, or engage in strenuous physical activity in the 8 to 12 hours before the blood draw.[28] Imaging of PGLs is the mainstay of diagnosis; the initial evaluation includes computed tomography (CT) of the neck and chest.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also has utility for the head and neck.[27] PGLs typically appear homogeneous with intense enhancement after administration of intravenous contrast.  MRI may also be used to distinguish the tumor from adjacent vascular and skeletal structures.  On T2-weighted images, a tumor that is larger than 2 cm is likely to display a classic "salt and pepper" appearance, a reflection of scattered areas of signal void mingled with areas of high signal intensity from increased vascularity.[29] Imaging of PHEOs usually consists of a dedicated CT of the adrenal glands.[30,31] Nuclear imaging, particularly somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) in combination with anatomic imaging, may be useful for localization and determination of the extent of disease (multifocality vs. distant metastatic deposits).[32]  Benign tumors are reported to be more sensitive to SRS than iodine I 123-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) imaging.  Sensitivity is highest for the head and neck region compared with abdomen PGLs or PHEOs (91% vs. 40% and 42%, respectively).[33]  SRS has been reported to be superior to MIBG in detecting metastatic tumors (95% vs. 23%, respectively).[33]  123I-MIBG, however,  is highly sensitive for PHEO [33]  and positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) is very specific for PGLs.   Functional imaging for PGLs and/or PHEOs with fluorine F 18-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA), 18F-fluorodopamine, or PET-CT may be particularly helpful in localizing head and neck tumors.  Data suggest that the selection of PET tracer used for tumor localization should be centered on the patient’s genetic status, on the basis of the metabolic activity of the various tumors.[14]  It has been suggested that patients with SDHx and VHL pathogenic variants are more likely to have higher 18F-fludeoxyglucose activity, which is related to gene activation in response to hypoxia.[14,34]  Some SDHB tumors only weakly concentrate 18F-DOPA, and patients with SDHx pathogenic variants may have false-negative results with such scans.  Tumors with VHL pathogenic variants may be missed with MIBG scans.[14] While further study is needed to determine the optimal imaging strategy for each PHEO/PGL case, gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE (68Ga-DOTATATE) PET-CT is a more recently developed, highly sensitive imaging modality that can identify PHEOs/PGLs.[11,35,36] Two small case series found that 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT improved PHEO/PGL identification when compared with conventional imaging done with MRI or CT.[37,38] A meta-analysis found that 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT exhibited superior performance for PHEO/PGL detection over other functional imaging modalities in patients with PHEOs/PGLs.[36] The pooled detection rate for 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT was 93% when compared with 80% for fluorine F 18-fluorohydroxyphenylalanine (18F-FDOPA) PET-CT, 74% for fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET-CT, and 38% for 123I-MIBG scans.  However, a  recent study of 14 patients examined the performance of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT, 18F-FDG PET-CT, 18F-FDOPA PET-CT, and MRI in visualizing sporadic primary PHEOs. This study found that 18F-FDOPA PET-CT identified 100% of sporadic PHEOs.  Further study is needed to determine if a PHEO's  genetic status and secretory capacity can  drive decision making regarding preferred PHEO imaging modalities. A significant proportion of individuals presenting with apparently sporadic PHEO or PGL are carriers of  germline pathogenic variants. Up to 33% of patients with apparently sporadic PHEO, and up to 40% of patients with apparently sporadic PGLs, actually have a recognizable germline pathogenic variant in one of the classical PGL/PHEO susceptibility genes.[21,39-44] One study found that in individuals with a single tumor and a negative family history, the likelihood of an inherited pathogenic variant was 11.6%,[21] whereas other groups detected pathogenic variants in 41% of such patients.[43,45] A large population study reported that up to 85% of patients younger than 21 years with a PGL/PHEO had a pathogenic variant. Specifically, 50% of these patients had an SDHB pathogenic variant.[13,46] For more information, see Childhood Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma Treatment. Even among carriers of SDHB pathogenic variants, there can be reduced penetrance and delayed onset of disease, which may further obscure the hereditary nature of the disease.[47]  Genetic testing is recommended for all patients with PHEOs or PGLs, even in those who have a single PHEO/PGL but do not have personal or family histories of these tumors.  Genetic testing is recommended in this scenario because of the high frequency of pathogenic variants associated with PHEO/PGL predisposition syndromes.[27,48] PGLs and PHEOs can be seen as part of several well-described tumor susceptibility syndromes including von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), MEN2, neurofibromatosis type 1, Carney-Stratakis syndrome, and familial paraganglioma (FPGL) syndrome. FPGL is most commonly caused by pathogenic variants in one of the following four genes: SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD (collectively referred to as SDHx). The SDHx proteins form part of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, which is located on the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism.[49]  Pathogenic variants in SDHB are most common, followed by SDHD and rarely SDHC and SDHA. Pathogenic variants in the SDHAF2 (also called SDH5), TMEM127, and MAX genes have been described in FPGL/PHEO,[50-53] but these variants are less common. The mechanism of tumor formation has remained elusive. One study suggests that SDHx-associated tumors display a hypermethylator phenotype that is associated with downregulation of important genes involved in the differentiation of neuroendocrine tissues.[54] The inheritance pattern of FPGL depends on the gene involved. While most families show traditional autosomal dominant inheritance, those with pathogenic variants in SDHAF2 and SDHD show almost exclusive paternal transmission of the phenotype. FPGL/PHEO syndromes are among the rare inherited diseases in which genomic imprinting contributes to the risk of disease. For example, the SDHD pathogenic variant is normally not activated when inherited from the mother, and the risk of FPGL/PHEO syndromes is not increased. There are reports of disease in individuals with maternally inherited SDHD pathogenic variants,[55-58] although the apparent risk is still unknown but appears to be quite low. However, when a pathogenic variant is inherited from the father, the risk for FPGL/PHEO is greatly increased.[59,60] In other words, while the pathogenic variant can be passed down from mother or father, tumors are almost exclusively seen in individuals with paternally inherited pathogenic variants.[59,60] Potential mechanism(s) of tumorigenesis in individuals with maternally inherited pathogenic variants have been described.[58,61] In cases of FPGL not caused by SDHD or SDHAF2 pathogenic variants, first-degree relatives (FDRs) of an affected individual have a 50% chance of carrying the pathogenic variant and are at increased risk of developing PGLs. Because the family history can appear negative in families with lower penetrance pathogenic variants, it is important to offer genetic testing to all unaffected FDRs once the pathogenic variant in the family has been identified. Genetic testing for hereditary PHEO and PGL syndromes has until recently been largely based on published algorithms,[27] whereby testing is performed stepwise on the basis of factors such as tumor type and location, age at diagnosis, family history, and presence of malignancy.[21,62,63] This approach allowed for cost-effective, targeted testing on the basis of clinical features. Within the last several years, however, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has led to a dramatic decrease in the cost and increase in the efficiency of genetic testing, and  interrogation of pathogenic variants in 10 to 30 genes for the same cost of testing two or three genes is now possible.[64] These tests are particularly effective for individuals and families who have an atypical presentation or overlapping clinical features where the "best fit" candidate gene is not obvious.[65]  Screening through a multigene panel moderately increases the detection rate. In a small series of 87 patients with PHEO, 25.3% of individuals (22 of 87) were found to have germline pathogenic variants on a screening panel that included ten PGL/PHEO-associated genes; 11.7% had germline pathogenic variants in VHL, 6.8% in RET, 2.3% in SDHD, 2.3% in MAX, 1.1% in SDHB, and 1.1% in TMEM127.[66] Apparently sporadic tumors were present in 74.7% of patients (65 of 87). In FPGL/PHEO, the type and location of tumors, age at onset, and lifetime penetrance vary depending on which genetic variant an individual has. While these correlations can help guide genetic testing and screening decisions, caution must be used since there is a high degree of variability in these conditions. For more information, see Table 6. SDHD pathogenic variants are mainly associated with an increased risk of parasympathetic PGLs.  These are more commonly multifocal and located in the head and neck, with a low rate of malignancy.[13,24,67,68] Multiple series showed a risk of 71% for a head and neck tumor in SDHD carriers.[23,69] The lifetime risk for any PGL in any location in SDHD carriers was estimated to be as high as 77% by age 50 years in one series [69] and 90% by age 70 years in a second series.[68] A review of more than 1,700 cases reported in the literature provided similar estimates, suggesting a lifetime penetrance of 86%.[70] In another study of 160 probands and nonprobands with SDHD pathogenic variants, the risk to age 60 years for all PGL/PHEO was 79%, but the risk for nonprobands only to age 60 years was 50%. In this same study, there was a statistically significant higher penetrance for symptomatic tumors associated with SDHD pathogenic variants compared with SDHB.[67] The SDHD pathogenic variant p.Pro81Leu (P81L) is common, especially among individuals of European ancestry, and has been previously described as having a distinct phenotype with a low risk for PHEO and sympathetic PGL, and almost exclusive presentation of head and neck PGL.[68] In a 2018 study, the risk to age 60 years for PHEO and sympathetic PGL was lower than 5% among probands and nonprobands with P81L and higher than 25% among those with other SDHD pathogenic variants (P = .01).[67] Pathogenic variants in the SDHB gene are associated with sympathetic PGLs, although PHEO and parasympathetic PGLs also have been described. SDHB PGLs are more commonly located in the abdomen and mediastinum than in the head and neck. While older studies reported a high age-related penetrance,[70] newer data suggest that the penetrance ranges from 9% to 35% by age 50 years.[47,71-74] There is some evidence that the penetrance in SDHB carriers may be lower in females than in males.[67,75] Symptoms of hormonal hypersecretion in those with pediatric-onset PGL/PHEO were common in one series of pediatric carriers of SDHB germline pathogenic variants; hypertension was seen in 76%, followed by headache in 68%, sweating/diaphoresis in 51%, palpitations in 40%, nausea and/or vomiting in 31%, and flushing in 25%.[13] The rate of malignancy is higher with SDHB than with the other SDH genes, with up to  one-third of patients having malignant tumors in most series.[68,69] However, in one study among nonprobands only, the rate of malignant disease to age 60 was only 4.2 %.[67] One single-center study of pediatric SDHB carriers found that 70% of childhood-onset PGL/PHEO patients developed metastatic disease, with a median interval between diagnoses of primary tumors of 4 years (range, 0–26 y).[13] Pathogenic variants in SDHB have also been associated with several other tumors and malignancies, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), pituitary tumors, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and papillary thyroid cancer.[67-69] SDHC pathogenic variants are rare, accounting for an estimated 0.5% of all PGLs.[70] In one series of 153 patients with multiple PGLs or a single PGL diagnosed before age 40 years, 3 (2%) had an SDHC pathogenic variant.[40] Another series of 121 index cases from a head and neck PGL registry showed a pathogenic variant rate of 4% (5 of 121), [76] and another series identified 26 SDHC variants among 391 probands with PGL/PHEO (6.6%).[67] SDHC pathogenic variants most commonly cause head and neck PGLs but have been seen in a small number of patients with abdominal PGLs.[21,67,77] Given small populations sizes, lifetime risk estimates for PGL/PHEO associated with pathogenic SDHC variants are limited, but one study of 43 probands and nonprobands found a lifetime risk for all PGL/PHEO to age 60 years of approximately 75%; among nonprobands only, the risk was 25% (95% confidence interval, 0%–57%).[67]  Pathogenic variants in SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD can also cause Carney-Stratakis syndrome, which is characterized by the classic dyad of PGLs and GISTs but can also include pituitary and thyroid tumors.[67,78] Pathogenic variants in SDHA, SDHAF2, MAX, and TMEM127 have also been described; collectively, they account for up to 6% of cases without pathogenic variants in the classical PGL/PHEO genes, with about one-half of these in SDHA.[65] Although biallelic pathogenic variants in SDHA have long been known to cause the autosomal recessive condition inherited juvenile encephalopathy/Leigh syndrome,[79] it was not until recently that monoallelic pathogenic variants were linked to an increased risk of developing PGL. One series showed a 7.6% incidence of SDHA pathogenic variants in a cohort of 393 patients with PGL in the Netherlands.[80]  Tumors most commonly develop in the head and neck, followed by the adrenal glands and abdomen (extra-adrenal).[81,82]  In the same series from the Netherlands,[80] the estimated penetrance for non-index pathogenic variant carriers was 10% by age 70 years. Initially, pathogenic variants in SDHAF2 were described only in head and neck PGLs.[53] The MAX gene was first described as a PHEO susceptibility gene in 2011 through exome sequencing of three unrelated cases.[50]  Three different germline pathogenic variants were identified, and a follow-up series of 59 cases by the same group identified an additional five variants. The MAX protein plays a key role in the development and progression of neural crest cell tumors.[83] The TMEM127 gene is located on chromosome 2q11.2. It encodes a transmembrane protein that is a negative regulator of mTOR, which regulates multiple cellular processes. A review of 23 patients with TMEM127 pathogenic variants showed that 96% (22 of 23) had a PHEO, and  9% (2 of 23) had a PGL.[70] TMEM127-associated tumors were diagnosed at an average age of  45 years, which is older  than the average age of diagnosis in other hereditary PGL/PHEO syndromes. However, individuals with TMEM127 pathogenic variants have a high chance to develop multiple tumors, either synchronously or metachronously. One large study suggested that TMEM127-associated tumors metastasized infrequently; however,   the follow-up period was short. RCC occurred frequently in this population. Hence, RCC risk should be considered when creating  surveillance plans for patients with TMEM127 pathogenic variants.[84] Another study looked at TMEM127 and other genes. Here, an additional 58 patients from the European-American-Asian Pheochromocytoma-Paraganglioma Registry Study Group more than doubled the number of previously reported carriers of rare PGL/PHEO predisposition genes SDHA (n = 29), SDHAF2 (n = 1), MAX (n = 8), and TMEM127 (n = 20).[65] The study identified malignant disease in 12% of SDHA pathogenic variant carriers and 10% of TMEM127 carriers, which is significantly higher than previous estimates. Extra-adrenal tumors were common in the cohort (48%), particularly in SDHA carriers (79%) who had an overrepresentation of head and neck tumors (44%). However, no GIST tumors were identified in SDHA carriers in this cohort, compared with frequent reports in previously identified cohorts. SDHA-related tumors occurred in patients as young as 8 years. Tumors associated with MAX pathogenic variants were almost all in the adrenal glands, and frequently bilateral. Overall, penetrance of developing a PGL/PHEO by age 40 years was estimated to be 73% for MAX pathogenic variant carriers, 41% for TMEM127 carriers, and 39% for SDHA carriers. Penetrance was also calculated for pathogenic variant–positive relatives and was significantly lower for these individuals (13%) compared with index patients for SDHA carriers, but not significantly different for MAX or TMEM127 probands and nonprobands. It is important to remember that these relatively small studies are prone to selection and ascertainment biases, as mentioned above. For example, only 22% of family members from this cohort had cascade screening, which affects penetrance calculations. Additionally, the high rates of metastatic disease could represent ascertainment bias of a tertiary care center, and the lack of GIST tumors could be because this was a PGL/PHEO-specific registry, and therefore might not capture the full spectrum of related tumors.[85] Patients with an identified germline pathogenic variant in one of the SDH genes are at a significantly increased risk of developing PGLs, PHEOs, renal tumors, and GISTs. PHEOs and PGLs typically have a slow growth pattern, but unchecked growth can lead to mass effect and, ultimately, neurologic compromise. Further, although most of these tumors are benign, some may undergo malignant transformation.  As such, periodic screening for interval development of a tumor is of critical importance because early detection and removal can minimize risk to the patient.[15] Although limited studies have been performed to delineate the ideal protocol, total-body MRI has been proposed as a reasonable method for screening because of its high sensitivity and minimal radiation exposure.[27,86]  In one study, 37 carriers of SDHx pathogenic variants underwent annual biochemical testing and annual or biennial whole-body MRI beginning at age 10 years.[87]  This screening protocol identified six tumors in five patients.  The sensitivity of MRI was 87.5%, and the specificity was 94.7%. The sensitivity of biochemical testing was significantly lower at 37.5%, with a specificity similar to MRI at 94.9%.[87] A retrospective study of 157 patients evaluated a rapid contrast-enhanced angio-MRI protocol for the detection of head and neck paragangliomas in carriers of SDH pathogenic variants.[88]  This protocol had a high sensitivity and specificity of 88.7% and 93.7%, respectively. Another group, analyzing their experience with a cohort of 157 patients, proposed an algorithm of sequential queries into tumor characteristics to identify those at greatest risk for malignant tumors, and therefore more rigorous surveillance.  The presence of any one of the following features including extra-adrenal location, positive family history, positive genetic testing, or tumor size greater than 4 cm was associated with a 100% sensitivity and a 42.5% specificity for the identification of malignancy.  The authors further suggested that long-term surveillance may be de-escalated for those patients with small adrenal tumors (4 cm or smaller), as none developed a malignancy in their cohort after a mean follow-up of 7.3 years.[15]  Prospective validation of these findings at another institution would be valuable. Although the optimal imaging protocol in SDH pathogenic variant carriers remains unclear, annual biochemical testing and clinical surveillance may be considered.  A combined approach of imaging and biochemical testing may be beneficial, since biochemical testing can miss up to 29% of SDH-related tumors, and imaging  has varying sensitivity rates based on the radioisotope that is used.[89] Biochemical testing can be performed by measuring plasma-free metanephrines/catecholamines or 24-hour urinary excretion of fractionated catecholamines (including methoxytyramine, a dopamine metabolite, if available). Clinical surveillance may include physical examination and blood pressure measurement. Clinical surveillance and biochemical testing may begin between ages 5 years and 10 years, or 10 years earlier than the earliest age at diagnosis in the family.[90,91] It is unknown whether continued surveillance beyond age 50 to 60 years is beneficial when a patient is asymptomatic. This  is an active area of investigation.[92] One highly specialized center has recommended beginning surveillance at age 6 years for SDHB carriers.[13] Level of evidence: 4 Medical management is the bridge to surgical resection of PGLs/PHEOs. Preoperative medical therapy is not essential for patients without evidence of catecholamine hypersecretion, although some advocate its use regardless of the results of hormonal testing.[28] The aim of pharmacologic therapy is to control hypertension for at least 10 to 14 days before surgery.[93]  Management is aimed at preventing catecholamine-induced complications, even in patients who may not present with preoperative hypertension, to avoid intraoperative hypertensive crisis, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, and cardiac ischemia. Failure to adequately block the catecholamine excess can dramatically increase the risk of perioperative mortality from hypertensive crisis and lethal arrhythmias and cause hypotensive crisis after tumor removal.[94,95] In the absence of a randomized controlled trial comparing the various regimens, there is no universally recommended approach.  The alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline) is most frequently used  to control blood pressure and expand the blood volume.[28] Other alpha-blocking drugs have also been used with success, including prazosin, terazosin, or doxazosin; these drugs are more specific alpha-1 adrenergic competitive antagonists and have a shorter half-life than phenoxybenzamine.[96,97] The noncompetitive binding of phenoxybenzamine to the alpha receptors, coupled with its longer half-life, may result in a sustained effect of the drug, with some patients experiencing postoperative hypotension.[28,98]  One study found that patients treated with sustained-release doxazosin had more stable perioperative hemodynamic changes and a shorter time interval to preoperative blood pressure control than did patients who received phenoxybenzamine.[98] A high-volume tertiary care center proposed deviating from the general recommendation for perioperative alpha-receptor blockade. In a closed-case series that compared patients with and without blockade, there was no significant difference in maximal intraoperative systolic arterial pressure or hypertensive episodes.[99] Further study is warranted. Once the alpha blockade is initiated, expansion of the blood volume is often necessary, as these patients are typically volume contracted.[100,101]  In addition to the vasodilatory effects from alpha blockade, volume expansion may be achieved by consuming a high-sodium diet and high fluid intake or a preoperative saline infusion.   A clinical manifestation of adequate blockade is the symptom of nasal stuffiness or lightheadedness. Calcium channel blockers such as nicardipine or nifedipine also have been employed to control the hypertension preoperatively.[102]  A calcium channel blocker may be used in conjunction with alpha and beta blockades for refractory hypertension. A calcium channel blocker can also be used alone as a second-line agent for patients with intolerable side effects from the alpha blockade.[28] Consideration of preoperative imaging is warranted if a pathogenic variant has been identified in a PHEO/PGL syndrome gene. This may alter an individual's surgical plan and approach.[46] This imaging  usually includes a dedicated CT scan of the adrenal glands to visualize PHEOs prior to  surgery. This scan can help determine if a cortical-sparing adrenalectomy approach is feasible.[30,31] For more information, see the Clinical Diagnosis of PGL and PHEO section. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for PGL and PHEO.  Both open resection and laparoscopic approaches are safe, but if feasible, laparoscopic removal is preferred.[90,103] Open resection is commonly recommended for large tumors (>6 cm–7 cm) because of the increased risk of technical difficulty within the confined space of  laparoscopy. Means of exposure and approach are based on the anatomic location of the tumor. Direct access to the adrenal and para-aortic region can be achieved with the posterior approach. It is direct, safe, and efficient.[104]
Adequate exposure of the complete tumor is important for complete removal. Robotic assistance can be utilized in select cases because it offers a three-dimensional, magnified view of the anatomy.[105]  The efficacy and safety of posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy is established, but ongoing studies are examining the relevance of this approach in familial syndromes (for more information, see NCT02618694). PGLs are commonly located in the para-aortic retroperitoneal sympathetic chain above the aortic bifurcation, below the takeoff of the inferior mesenteric artery (organ of Zuckerkandl), or near the dome of the bladder.[106,107] Malignant PGLs have a dense fibrous capsule that may adhere to surrounding vascularity, which can make  complete resection difficult or unfeasible.[11,107] Regional lymph nodes may be involved with malignant tumors, and if suspected preoperatively or noted intraoperatively, a regional lymphadenectomy may be performed. Genetic testing is best performed before the initial surgery to inform the risk of recurrent or contralateral disease and to guide the extent of resection (e.g., whether to preserve the cortex) because synchronous or metachronous bilateral disease is quite common in hereditary PHEO. Preoperative knowledge of a germline pathogenic variant significantly affects variables associated with a cortical-sparing adrenalectomy. Preserving the cortex is important in patients with a known pathogenic variant because they are at risk of developing a contralateral tumor. Cortical sparing reduces the possibility of future adrenal insufficiency with contralateral adrenalectomy. This consideration must be weighed against the high risk of malignancy in SDHB carriers. Cortical-sparing surgery is an attractive option because it minimizes the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the need for lifelong steroid supplementation.  In large series of patients, cortical-sparing surgery has a 3% to 7% recurrence rate after cortical preservation versus a 2% to 3% recurrence rate after total resection (recurrence in the adrenal bed).[9,108] The frequency of steroid dependence in both studies was lower in patients who underwent cortical-sparing techniques than in patients who did not (57% compared with 86%).  One of 39 patients (3%) developed adrenal insufficiency after a cortical-sparing procedure; 5 of 25 patients (20%) developed adrenal insufficiency after total adrenalectomy.[9]  These study authors recommend cortical-sparing surgery as a viable option for patients with hereditary PHEO, including patients who initially present with seemingly unilateral disease.

CSS is distinct from similarly named syndromes, Carney Complex and Carney Triad (for more information, see Table 7). CSS  is characterized by an autosomal dominant germline pathogenic variant in the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunit B, C, or D (SDHx) genes that demonstrates incomplete penetrance.  Affected individuals develop multifocal, locally aggressive gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and multiple neck, intrathoracic, and intra-abdominal paragangliomas (PGLs) at relatively early ages.[1-3]  CSS-associated GISTs and PGLs display phenotypes that differ from their sporadically occurring, more-common counterparts; as a result, it is important to understand the unique features of imaging, treatment, and surveillance in patients with CSS. The tumorigenesis of CSS-associated GISTs appears to involve succinate dehydrogenase deficiency rather than gain-of-function mutation in the KIT or PDGFRA gene, as is seen in the vast majority of GISTs.[10]  SDH deficiency is also a characteristic finding of pediatric-type GISTs; CSS-associated GISTs display clinical findings similar to these tumors, including young age at onset (median age, 19 y), specificity to the stomach, multifocality, and resistance to imatinib.[3,11-13] Furthermore, tumor size and mitotic rate do not accurately predict metastatic potential or survival, as SDH-deficient GISTs frequently metastasize to regional lymph nodes, the peritoneal cavity, and the liver; however, long-term survival is common.[6,14]  For more information about genetic testing for Carney-Stratakis syndrome, see the section on  Genetics, Inheritance, and Genetic Testing in the Familial Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma Syndrome section. Although the natural history of CSS is poorly understood, experts recommend that ongoing surveillance include the following: close patient follow-up with annual history that focuses on symptoms of anemia and catecholamine excess, physical exam, biochemical analysis with plasma metanephrine level and chromogranin A to detect recurrent PGLs, and cross-sectional imaging. Although many PGLs do not secrete catecholamines, chromogranin A has been found to be elevated in PGLs and may be a useful marker for tumor recurrence.  The appropriate screening imaging modality is unknown at this time, but fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography–computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) is highly sensitive at identifying extra-adrenal PGLs and GISTs.  Because of the risks of ionizing radiation exposure from CT, some suggest using MRI for annual surveillance.[15,16] Level of evidence: 4 Because multiple primary GISTs and PGLs are common with CSS, preoperative imaging is paramount to accurately identify the extent of disease before surgical planning.  Most patients will present having already undergone imaging with CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Both methods have excellent sensitivity for identifying PGLs, but additional functional imaging is recommended because of the diffuse nature of these tumors.   18F-FDG PET-CT is superior to iodine I 123-metaiodobenzylguanidine at identifying SDHx-associated PGLs and, because of the high metabolic activity of GISTs, has excellent sensitivity in identifying them.[15,17]  Thus, in patients with SDHx pathogenic variants, including those with CSS, 18F-FDG PET-CT is the preferred functional imaging modality to optimally detect and stage all GISTs and PGLs.[16]  Some evidence suggests that  fluorine F 18-fluorohydroxyphenylalanine (18F-FDOPA) PET-CT is superior at identifying the primary PGL, while 18F-FDG PET-CT is superior at identifying metastases. There are no prospective treatment studies involving patients with CSS; therefore, recommendations are based on limited clinical experience, single case series, and extrapolations from genetically-similar tumors with similar clinical behavior.  The mainstay of treatment for CSS-associated GISTs and PGLs is complete surgical resection of the tumor. The timing of the operation correlates with the presentation of the tumor. Surgical resection can be accomplished with laparoscopic or open techniques.  For PGLs, vascular reconstruction is uncommon.  Although PGLs are commonly present in the paraaortic region, the need for major vascular reconstruction is uncommon. GIST tumors can be resected with wedge resection and primary closure and re-anastomosis.  Ensuring negative margins is important, as patients for whom a complete resection is accomplished experience the longest survival.[18]   In the rare setting of synchronous disease, combined resection is appropriate if tolerable by the patient.   More commonly, tumors develop metachronously, with GISTs arising first; individual resection occurs at the time of diagnosis of each tumor. A thorough preoperative endoscopy and complete surgical exploration of the stomach are essential, as multiple separate GISTs are frequently encountered. The high frequency of multifocality and the likelihood of tumor recurrence do not justify a prophylactic total gastrectomy because of its substantial associated morbidity. Furthermore, a total gastrectomy is generally only performed when the current disease burden precludes a lesser resection.  To this end, gastric wedge resection with gross negative margins is the surgical goal.[19]  Sampling of any suspicious nodes at the time of resection is commonly performed.  Evidence suggests that locally advanced CSS-associated GISTs demonstrate a rather indolent course;[20] thus, the concern for nodal involvement based on preoperative imaging or abdominal exploration need not deter resection of the primary tumor.  While a role for neoadjuvant imatinib in locally advanced adult-type GISTs has been widely described to improve resectability or reduce the burden of resection, it is unlikely to have any effect in locally advanced SDH-deficient GISTs.[21]  Evidence suggests that for these tumors, the second-line targeted agents, including sorafenib, sunitinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, may be beneficial in the adjuvant setting.[22,23]  No data support using these agents in the neoadjuvant setting at this time. Regarding treatment of CSS-associated PGLs,  patients are commonly initiated on alpha-blockade preoperatively to minimize perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality.  PGLs typically occur in the para-aortic chain from the urinary bladder and the aortic bifurcation to the superior mediastinum and head and neck.  As in the treatment of GISTs, the operative goal is resection of all known disease.   Preoperative imaging and intra-operative exploration are essential to achieving this goal.  Multiple tumors are common; when disease is present in the bilateral adrenal glands, the surgeon faces the possibility of rendering a patient steroid dependent with a lifelong risk of a fatal  Addisonian crisis.  In this setting, a surgeon proficient in performing a cortical-sparing adrenalectomy may be consulted.

Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common form of thyroid cancer, comprising over 85% of all cases, and is rapidly increasing in incidence worldwide.[1] Radiation exposure, particularly during childhood, has been extensively studied as a causative factor in the development of thyroid cancer; however, it accounts for only a small minority of cases.[2,3]   One of the strongest risk factors for the development of thyroid cancer is a family history of the disease, in which cases are termed familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC).  The exact incidence of FNMTC is difficult to determine because the criteria used to qualify as a heritable condition varies among studies.  Criteria that have yet to be universally defined include the number of affected relatives and their relationship (i.e., first-degree relatives, second-degree relatives, etc.), pattern of inheritance, and the presence of coexisting thyroid conditions. Further confounding the distinction between inherited and sporadic disease is the high prevalence of incidental microcarcinomas, which may be found in 10% to 15% of surgeries or autopsies.[4]  Because there are, as of yet, no known gene variants responsible for FNMTC   in the majority of families, this high background prevalence of disease poses a challenge in assessing the risk of a thyroid malignancy in other family members.  This uncertainty may be especially problematic in equivocal cases of inherited disease; for example, two second-degree relatives with thyroid cancer. FNMTC may be part of a larger syndrome associated with tumors involving other organs or may represent a stand-alone condition.  Table 8 outlines the various hereditary syndromes associated with NMTC. The genetics of familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC) in the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 are well established. Genetic factors also clearly contribute to NMTC, as it has one of the highest heritabilities of any cancer site, with a relative risk of fivefold to tenfold for relatives of patients, especially (female) siblings.[5-8] FNMTC, which includes follicular subtypes, primarily papillary, is thought to account for 5% to 10% of all NMTC cases.[5,9,10] Notably, when there are only two individuals affected in a family, there is a 40% to 60% chance  that the disease is actually sporadic, whereas when three or more family members are affected there is a 96% chance the disease has an inherited component.[11] With the exception of a few rare genetic syndromes with NMTC as a minor component, the majority of FNMTC is nonsyndromic and the underlying genetic predisposition is unclear. Still, the term familial cancer is somewhat misleading as FNMTC pedigrees demonstrate a definitive mendelian pattern of inheritance which is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.[5,12-15] However, unlike FMTC, FNMTC is a polygenic disease with no single locus responsible for the majority of cases or easily identifiable phenotype and it is likely modified by multiple low-penetrance alleles and environmental factors.[16] As there is no clinical genetic testing for nonsyndromic FNMTC, identification of at-risk families must rely on astute clinicians obtaining a thorough clinical examination and detailed personal and family history of any patient presenting with thyroid cancer or disease. Aspects of a history that suggest FNMTC include multiple generations affected, early-onset bilateral/multifocal thyroid tumors (especially in males) with a more aggressive clinical course, and association with benign thyroid pathologies.[17] Detailed work-up is critical in FNMTC as it is ultimately a diagnosis of exclusion in the sense that other familial cancer predisposition syndromes associated with NMTC must first be ruled out, such as Cowden syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis. These differential diagnoses for FNMTC are outlined in Table 8. Notably, the association of NMTC with McCune-Albright, Peutz-Jeghers, ataxia-telangiectasia, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndromes is less established. Various methods have been employed to uncover the landscape of genetic variation associated with FNMTC, mainly genome-wide linkage analysis using microsatellite markers evenly distributed across the genome and informative large pedigrees with multiple affected family members. More than 15 genetic loci have been linked to FNMTC, which are summarized in Table 9. The loci that are italicized represent those where the susceptibility gene has been identified; the causal genes at the other loci remain unknown. The first four loci were identified by microsatellite linkage analysis. The remaining loci have been identified by increasingly dense single nucleotide variant (SNV) arrays as well as microRNA arrays and, most recently, next-generation sequencing.  Most of these studies have been done on groups of families with pedigrees consistent with FNMTC; however, two of the loci were identified through large, population level SNV array analysis.  Notably, several studies have excluded the genes that are most commonly somatically altered in association with sporadic NMTC as having a role in FNMTC, namely BRAF, RET, RET/PTC, MET, MEK1, MEK2, RAS, and NTRK.[20] For more information on linkage analysis and next-generation sequencing, see Cancer Genetics Overview. MNG1, TCO, fPTC/PRN and NMTC1 are proposed FNMTC susceptibility loci identified in families with multiple affected individuals and are summarized in Table 9. Conflicting evidence exists regarding the linkage to the loci described above. MNG1 has shown strong evidence of linkage in only one Canadian kindred with multiple multinodular goiters (MNGs) and linkage analyses in 124 additional families failed to find an association between MNG1 and FNMTC. Therefore, the locus may be important for MNG alone but not for FNMTC.[21,22,26,37-39] TCO accounts for a minority of FNMTC cases, but specifically those associated with tumor cell oxyphilia, which is a rare morphology that does not apply to the majority of FNMTC cases ascertained.[22-25] fPTC/PRN is also a rare subtype of FNMTC in which PTC is associated with papillary renal neoplasia, but other than the original family reported, no additional families sharing this phenotype have been identified.[22,26,39] NMTC1 seems to predispose to the follicular variant of PTC, another rare subtype. Classic PTC and oxyphilic tumors are also associated with this locus, though to a lesser extent.[24,24,27] In 2001, a comprehensive mutation and linkage analysis of 22 international FNMTC families revealed that only one family had significant linkage to any known susceptibility locus (TCO in this case), including the ones described above.[22] This cumulative evidence suggests that these FNMTC loci account for disease in a small subset of families, which is consistent with the concept that FNMTC exhibits genetic and locus heterogeneity. Five FNMTC loci have been identified through increasingly dense SNV arrays, also listed in Table 9. The first FNMTC study done by SNV array along with microsatellite analysis was in 2008 in a Portuguese family.[28] This family had five  members with PTC (4 classic and 1 follicular variant) and 11 members with benign thyroid diseases. The susceptibility locus was identified at 8p23.1-p22 and designated FTEN (familial thyroid epithelial neoplasia).  The 8q24 locus was first identified from a linkage analysis study using SNV arrays of 26 FNMTC families (with PTC). One family had three generations of PTC and melanoma (and MNG); but melanoma was not reported in the other 25 families. Sequencing of genes in the 8q24 region did not reveal any candidate pathogenic variants, but gene expression analysis indicated AK023948 (PTSCC1), a noncoding RNA gene that is downregulated in PTC, could be involved.[29] In 2009, a population-level study was done in Iceland on 197 cases of PTC or FTC and compared with genotypes of 37,196 Icelandic controls.[30] Two loci had high statistical significance, 9q22.33 and 14q13.3, which are near the genes FOXE1 and NKX2-1, respectively. Two SNVs in particular were associated with increased risk of PTC and FTC: rs944289 (near NKX2-1) and rs965513 (near FOXE1). These results were replicated in two additional large cohorts from the United States (726 individuals tested) and Spain (1,433 individuals tested), as well as other cohorts that also found additional SNVs of interest, particularly in FOXE1.[30,40,41] FOXE1 remains a gene of interest in FNMTC because it produces a thyroid transcription factor with a key role in thyroid gland formation, differentiation, and function.[42] The NKX2.1/TITF-1 gene also encodes a thyroid transcription factor. A germline variant, A339V, has been reported in two FNMTC families affected with MNG or PTC/MNG;[43] however, this association could not be replicated in subsequent studies of other families.[44] Lastly, a large United States and Italian cohort (110 individuals, 49 affected, from 28 FNMTC families) was studied using a 50K SNV array. The majority of these families had classic PTC. The pooled analysis showed linkage to previously identified 1q21 locus (PRN) and a new locus at 6q22.[31] miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Whole-genome miRNA microarrays were used to evaluate 21 sporadic and seven familial NMTC cases, as well as ten normal thyroid tissue samples.[32] Two miRNAs, miR-20a (13q31.3) and miR-886-3p (5q31.2), were differentially expressed between sporadic and familial NMTC, as confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Both were also downregulated in NMTC compared with normal thyroid tissues by fourfold. Cell-line transfection studies using miR-886-3p confirmed that it plays a critical role in cell proliferation and migration and it regulates genes involved in DNA replication and focal adhesion pathways.[32] Furthermore, a polymorphism in pre-miR-146a (rs2910164) has been shown to affect miRNA expression and was identified in a significant proportion of the tumors of 608 PTC patients, suggesting it could contribute to genetic predisposition to PTC and play a role in the tumorigenesis through somatic changes.[45] The role of gene regulatory mechanisms and their effect on gene expression and FNMTC tumorigenesis warrants further exploration. Telomeres are noncoding chromosomal ends consisting of tandem repeats that are important in maintaining chromosomal stability. Telomere length is maintained by a telomerase complex that includes telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), along with six other proteins: TRF1, TFR2, RAP1, TIN2, TPP1, and POT1.[46] Shortened telomere length is associated with chromosomal instability that can play a role in cancer development. The telomere-telomerase complex has become a focus of investigation as another possible genetic mechanism for predisposition to FNMTC. In 2008, a cohort of patients with FNMTC was studied using qualitative PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization to evaluate relative telomere length.[33] They found that telomere length was significantly shorter in familial PTC patients compared with unaffected family members and sporadic PTC. The same group also found that the telomeres in FNMTC cancers were relatively fragile and had a high rate of fragment formation.[47] A second study of telomere length in FNMTC also showed shorter telomere lengths in 13 affected patients compared with 31 unaffected family members.[48] However, the same study showed that relative telomere length was not associated with altered copy number or expression of telomere complex genes hTERT, TRF1, TFR2, RAP1, TIN2, TPP1, or POT1. Other studies have failed to show any significant differences in telomere length between FNMTC and sporadic PTC cases.[49] The role and mechanism of the telomere-telomerase complex in predisposition to FNMTC remains to be elucidated. SRGAP1 is a gene that was identified in 2013 through genome-wide linkage analysis of 38 FNMTC families with PTC from the United States and Poland.[34] Four germline missense variants were identified but two variants, Q149H and A275T, were most notable because they segregated in two separate families but not in 800 sporadic cases. SRGAP1 regulates the small G-protein CDC42 in neurons and affects cell mobility.[50] Functional assays demonstrated that Q149H and R617C variants in SRGAP1 could lead to loss-of-function changes that impair ability to inactivate CDC42, which could lead to tumorigenesis.[34] Further studies are needed to validate the association of this gene in other FNMTC cohorts. HAPB2 was identified in 2015 through whole-exome sequencing (WES) in seven affected members of an FNMTC kindred with PTC and follicular adenoma, using unaffected spouses as controls.[35] One specific germline variant, G534E, was found in the heterozygous state in all affected cases. The group also detected this variant through next-generation sequencing in 4.7% of NMTC cases from the Cancer Genome Atlas. This variant was associated with increased HAPB2 protein expression in the thyroid neoplasms of affected family members. This was not seen in normal thyroid tissue or in individuals with sporadic PTC. Functional G534E studies showed that this variant increased colony formation and cellular migration, suggesting a loss of tumor suppression function. Notably, the authors used a criterion of general population frequency of 1% or less to filter variants identified in this kindred using the 1000 Genomes Project (phase III) and HapMap3. However, subsequent correspondences commented on higher reported frequencies of G534E variants from public databases including that of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) (2.22% in the total population, 3.29% in non-Finnish European individuals) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Grand Opportunity Exome Sequencing Project database (5.5% in the total population, 3.88% in American individuals of European descent).[51-53] Many additional studies were conducted to ascertain the frequency of HAPB2 G534E in FNMTC with variable results. While the G534E variant was not identified in 12 Chinese FNMTC families with PTC (nor in 217 patients with sporadic PTC) [53] or in 11 Middle Eastern FNMTC family members,[54] it was shown to segregate in several independent FNMTC kindreds with PTC from a United States study.[55] Several other studies showed that the G534E variant was found in controls and sporadic cases just as often, or more often, than it was found in familial cases of PTC (if the variant was identified in familial PTC cohorts at all). In some cases, the G534E variant did not segregate with disease in familial PTC cohorts.[54,56-58] Therefore, it seems that the HAPB2 G534E variant frequency differs among ancestries and populations; this variant was present in low-to-moderate levels in individuals of European ancestry and in low levels, or completely absent, in individuals of Asian and Middle Eastern ancestries. Larger validation studies are required to determine its role and association with FNMTC. Lastly, RTFC (c14orf93) was identified through WES of FNMTC families in China.[36] Three genes were identified as candidate genes for FNMTC (RTFC, PYGL, and BMP4) but the RTFC gene was the only one shown to have oncogenic function in promoting thyroid cancer cell survival under starving conditions and promoting cell migration and colony-forming capacity. Specifically, the V205M (c.613G>C) variant in RTFC was important because it was identified in FNMTC patients but absent in unaffected controls. Two additional oncogenic mutations of RTFC were identified (R115Q and G209D) in patients with sporadic NMTC. Collectively, the ExAC frequencies of these variants in East Asian populations are higher than the ExAC frequencies in the total population, which may indicate that this gene is most relevant in East Asian families with FNMTC. Larger validation studies of this gene and these variants need to be conducted. In summary, although multiple susceptibility loci have been identified in FNMTC families, no single locus accounts for the majority of nonsyndromic FNMTC and no gene identified shows strong enough associations to warrant clinical genetic testing. Newer sequencing techniques, including WES, will allow for new genes to be discovered and evaluated. Identifying susceptibility genes will allow for screening and early diagnosis, which in turn would lead to improved outcomes for patients and families. Differentiated thyroid cancer, whether inherited or sporadic, may be associated with a high rate of recurrence, depending on the clinicopathologic features of the disease.  Disease recurrence may occur as late as 40 years after initial diagnosis.[59]  Surveillance for recurrent disease therefore plays an important role in the long-term management of patients with these tumors.  The optimal follow-up strategy is dependent upon both the initial tumor characteristics and the patient's response to therapy.[60]  Fortunately, for most patients, the disease is associated with a low risk of recurrence, and surveillance is accordingly less intensive.  In these cases, postoperative evaluation is centered on sonographic examination of the neck and measurement of serum thyroglobulin.[60] Thyroglobulin, a protein produced by both benign and malignant thyroid follicular cells, is used as a tumor marker for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.  Thyroglobulin measurement is most sensitive after a total thyroidectomy, so detection of thyroglobulin—particularly an increasing trend in the serum concentration—is often an early indicator of recurrent or progressive disease.[61]  However, it is important to recognize several caveats about the use of this tumor marker.  It is imperative to assess serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroglobulin antibody levels concomitantly at each measurement.  Thyroglobulin rises with increasing TSH values; therefore, an elevating thyroglobulin level could indicate progressive disease or simply a rising TSH level.  Furthermore, the presence of thyroglobulin antibodies can interfere with the accurate measurement of thyroglobulin, with most cases resulting in a spurious lowering of the tumor marker.[62] In such cases, the antibody titer may be used as a surrogate marker of disease status.[60]  The final caveat about the use of thyroglobulin as a tumor marker is that the test must be performed in the same laboratory at each measurement to accurately assess the trend in levels; each assay can render a different value of thyroglobulin on the same serum sample.[60]  Measurement of serum thyroglobulin to assess for recurrent or persistent disease may be performed 3 to 6 months after therapy is completed and monitored periodically thereafter, depending on the concern for persistent or recurrent disease.[60] Stimulated thyroglobulin testing (after withdrawal of thyroid hormone reaches a minimum TSH level of 30 mIU/L or after recombinant TSH injection) may be useful in select patients, particularly in patients with follicular thyroid cancer or in whom there is high clinical suspicion of recurrent or residual disease. Whether a patient has received radioactive iodine or only surgery, careful ultrasonography of all compartments in the anterior neck is an important tool to determine if there is recurrent or residual disease because most disease is localized in this region. The initial ultrasonography is typically performed 6 to 12 months after surgery.[60]  Ultrasonography may be performed sooner if there is concern about residual disease, but it is important for the sonographer to recognize the potential for false-positive findings due to postoperative swelling.  The timing and need for subsequent sonographic evaluation of the neck is dependent upon the patient’s risk for recurrence and the serum thyroglobulin status.[60] Ultrasonography combined with a serum thyroglobulin test has a very high sensitivity for identifying nodal disease, far superior to the radioiodine diagnostic whole-body scans that were historically the mainstay of surveillance.[61] Once a thyroid nodule is detected, further work-up includes complete ultrasonography of the thyroid, as well as a comprehensive neck ultrasonography to evaluate the central and lateral neck lymph nodes.  Comprehensive preoperative neck ultrasonography not only provides the opportunity for fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of any suspicious nodes before surgery but also allows the surgeon to plan the appropriate surgery and counsel the patient regarding a surgical procedure and its associated risks.[63] FNA is indicated for cytologic evaluation of suspicious nodules based on size of the nodule, imaging characteristics, and associated patient risk factors.[64,65] Most current guidelines recommend consideration of  FNA biopsy of all nodules measuring 10 mm or larger.  Those nodules with less suspicious sonographic features may be considered for FNA at a larger size threshold.  Nodules smaller than 10 mm in greatest dimension may still warrant cytologic evaluation if radiographic imaging demonstrates features concerning for malignancy, such as suspicious lymphadenopathy or extrathyroidal extension. Consideration may also be given to perform FNA of sonographically suspicious nodules, regardless of size, for patients with a strong family history of thyroid cancer.  Ultrasonographic features suspicious for malignancy include hypoechogenicity, solid composition, taller-than-wide shape, infiltrative borders, and microcalcifications. Although positron emission tomography scanning is not recommended for thyroid nodule assessment, concentrated uptake of contrast in the thyroid gland may be detected when the scan is obtained for other reasons.  Incidental increase in fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose avidity, and an increase in nodule size (more than 50% volume) during surveillance may also be indications for FNA biopsy of nodules.[60] The Bethesda Thyroid Cytology Classification standardizes the cytologic interpretation of thyroid biopsies. Pathologic results are classified into one of the following six categories:[66] Nondiagnostic or unsatisfactory. Benign. Atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) or follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS). Follicular neoplasm or suspicious for follicular neoplasm. Suspicious for malignancy. Malignant. Patients with biopsy-proven malignant nodules (or nodules suspicious for malignancy) may be considered for surgical resection as discussed below.   Nodules classified as AUS/FLUS fall into the indeterminate category because the extent of architectural or cytologic atypia excludes a benign diagnosis, but the degree of atypia is insufficient for a definitive malignant classification.[66]  These lesions may be considered for repeat FNA, surveillance ultrasonography, molecular testing, or surgical removal on the basis  of clinical concern for malignancy, comorbid conditions, and/or family history of thyroid cancer.[60] Patients with a diagnosis of FNMTC may have increased aggressiveness of disease in comparison with sporadic cases.[67]  If there are three affected members of a kindred, the tumor is more likely to have aggressive features at a younger age; this suggests a more aggressive surgical management may be warranted.[68]  Most experts support total thyroidectomy because of the risk of increased frequency of multicentric disease, lymph node metastases, local invasion, and recurrence of aggressive disease.[67,69] Most surgeons would agree that patients with FNMTC and radiographically, clinically, or intraoperatively suspicious or biopsy-proven metastatic lymph nodes warrant total thyroidectomy and therapeutic compartment-based removal of the lymph node basin(s).  Controversy exists, however, as to the appropriate treatment of nonenlarged lymph nodes of the central neck at the time of initial thyroidectomy.  Specifically, some groups advocate routine prophylactic central node dissection (PCND) for all patients with known FNMTC to decrease the risk of local recurrence, although there are no specific, prospective, randomized data to support a survival benefit.[70,71] While two retrospective studies (not specific to hereditary thyroid cancer) have reported a reduction in disease recurrence rates associated with PCND,[72,73] two meta-analyses have shown that PCND does not reduce recurrence rates in a clinically significant manner.[74,75] The current recommendations published by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) state that prophylactic or bilateral Level VI lymph node dissection is recommended in patients with T3/T4 papillary cancer (whether familial or not), clinically involved lateral neck nodes or if the information will be used to plan further therapy such as radioactive iodine ablation. The ATA also states that this recommendation should be interpreted in light of available surgical expertise, acknowledging that PCND may lead to increased perioperative morbidity.[60]  Currently, selective, rather than routine PCND seems the most reasonable option to guide the decision process.[76] After total thyroidectomy, patients will need lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy.[60]  The levothyroxine replacement therapy dose is approximately 1.6 µg/kg/day and is then titrated to reach an appropriate level of TSH suppression.[77,78]  The degree of TSH suppression is also individualized on the basis of the patient’s disease status, risk of recurrence, an individual's risk of cardiovascular and bone complications with aggressive TSH suppression,[60] and clinicopathological tumor features.  Patients typically undergo a surveillance regimen for recurrence consisting of laboratory evaluation and ultrasonography.  In papillary and follicular cancer, thyroxine and TSH demonstrate the level of thyroid suppression, and thyroglobulin and thyroglobulin antibody levels are important markers for possible disease recurrence or metastases.

This section describes the latest changes made to this summary as of the date above. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2 Added ganglioneuromatosis of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as a clinical feature of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B). Added van den Broek et al. as reference 79. Revised text to state that it is critical for pediatricians and other providers who care for infants and children to maintain a high index of suspicion when evaluating patients with any of the clinical manifestations associated with MEN2B. In a child or infant, the presence of oral and ocular neuromas, GI manifestations, and/or a tall, lanky appearance may warrant further investigation. The identification of these features may prompt an early diagnosis of MEN2B and the opportunity to prevent or cure a patient’s medullary thyroid cancer.

T!tle : Did You Know: Sleep Trouble - NCI
ur$ : https://www.cancer.gov/connect-prevention-study/news/sleep
d@t@ :  Who Can Join  What to Expect  About the Study  Your Privacy  Study News   Connect for Cancer Prevention Study  Study News   Study News       In their first Connect survey, 2 in 3 participants reported they did not get restful sleep in the past month. In the first Connect survey, two of every three Connect participants reported that they didn’t get sound and restful sleep in the past month. Nearly half of participants reported feeling tired throughout the day, and about one in every four reported feeling irritable in the past week due to trouble sleeping. Getting regular, good sleep may help us stay healthy. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends seven to eight hours per day for adults (children need even more sleep). For most of us, our sleep routines could be improved. Research has shown that sleep disturbances, which include short, low-quality, or disrupted sleep, disrupt the repair to our bodies and brain that takes place while we sleep and raise the risk of certain chronic diseases, including risk for some cancers. Further, sleep loss can affect our ability to maintain a healthy body weight, by interrupting how our body breaks down food for nutrients and energy. Sleep has many benefits; it’s important for healing, strengthening immunity, improving mood and energy levels, and helping your brain function better! According to the American Heart Association, sleep may also help lower your risk of certain chronic diseases, such as high blood pressure, dementia, and depression. In the NIH AARP Diet and Health Study (another cohort study from the National Cancer Institute (NCI)*),  researchers saw a higher risk of stomach cancer in men who were characterized as “short sleepers,” (those sleeping less than seven hours per day). They observed risk patterns for several cancers to be related to sleep, though the relationships varied between men and women. In a newly published study by Chuck Matthews and his postdoctoral trainee, Joshua Freeman, both at the NCI, men in the United Kingdom who reported poor sleep quality (30 minutes or more of wakefulness after falling asleep) were 15-20% more likely to develop prostate cancer. This study used a new measure of sleep: a device worn around the wrist called an accelerometer (similar to the step counter in your phone), which captures different sleep characteristics. These studies, like many others, leave important questions unanswered. In Connect, we are interested in studying how various sleep patterns (including the length and timing of sleep), and sleep disruptions (e.g., not sleeping in a darkened room due to lights inside or outside), may relate to cancer risk. We also want to learn more about how sleep behaviors impact natural cycles of the body known as circadian rhythms. Length, timing, and quality of sleep, exposure to light, and food intake and physical activity patterns all affect circadian rhythms. If our natural cycles are off balance, it can affect our overall health and disease risk. When it comes to understanding the relationships between sleep and our health, there is a lot to learn! Connect is collecting information that researchers can use to study how circadian rhythms may affect cancer risk, which may help inform cancer prevention guidance. We aim to collect dietary and physical activity patterns in addition to detailed sleep information at different time points over the course of the study since sleep may change over the course of your life. Connect hopes to learn whether differences in sleep patterns relate to health among people of different ages, geographic locations, gender, ethnicities, lifestyles and occupations (e.g. night shift workers). With your help, we may be able to gain knowledge critical to the future of cancer prevention science that will benefit more communities. We are in this together. Thank you for contributing to Connect! If you’re having trouble getting quality sleep, or would like to improve your overall sleep health, check out these resources: From the CDC  

Basic information on sleep and tips for better rest  National Sleep Foundation's resource on getting better sleep  From the CDC Basic information on sleep and tips for better rest  Basic information on sleep and tips for better rest National Sleep Foundation's resource on getting better sleep If these suggestions don’t help, we recommend talking to your health care provider to explore other ways to improve your sleep. Whatever your relationship with sleep, know that you are not alone. There are lots of ways you can get better rest, including getting extra support. Perhaps you’ll take the new year as a fresh opportunity to focus on getting at least seven hours of sleep daily, as recommended by the CDC. See how it goes. And, take good care! On behalf of our team, best wishes for a healthy and happy new year to you and your loved ones.

General Information About Prostate Cancer  Prostate Cancer Prevention  About This PDQ Summary  Cancer prevention is action taken to lower the chance of getting 
         cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer 
         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower 
         the number of deaths caused by cancer. To prevent new cancers from starting, scientists look at risk 
         factors and protective factors. Anything that increases your 
         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; 
         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is 
         called a cancer protective factor. Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. 
         For example, both smoking and inheriting certain genes are 
         risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be 
         avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy diet may be protective 
         factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and 
         increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does 
         not mean that you will not get cancer. Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied. Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells
		  form in the tissues of the prostate. Prostate cancer is the second most common  cancer among men in
		  the United States. The prostate is a
		  gland in the male
		  reproductive system. The prostate is just
		  below the bladder (the organ that
		  collects and empties urine) and in
		  front of the rectum (the lower part
		  of the intestine). It is about the
		  size of a walnut and surrounds part of the urethra (the tube that empties urine from the
		  bladder). The prostate gland produces fluid that makes up part of the semen.
		  EnlargeAnatomy of the  male reproductive and urinary systems showing the ureters, bladder, prostate gland, urethra, penis, testicles, and other organs. As men age, the prostate may get bigger. A bigger prostate may block the flow of urine from the bladder and cause problems with sexual function. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is not cancer, but surgery may be
		  needed to correct it. The symptoms
		  of BPH or of other problems in the prostate may be
		  like symptoms of prostate cancer. EnlargeNormal prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A normal prostate does not block the flow of urine from the bladder. An enlarged prostate  presses on the bladder and urethra and blocks the flow of urine. Prostate cancer is most common in older men. In the United States, about one  out of every eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer.   Most men diagnosed with  prostate cancer do not die of it. See the following PDQ summaries for more information about prostate cancer: Prostate Cancer Screening Prostate Cancer Treatment Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may
		  help prevent  cancer. The following risk factors may increase 
         the risk of prostate cancer:Age Family history of prostate cancer Race HormonesVitamin EFolic acidDairy and calcium The following protective factors may 
         decrease the risk of prostate  cancer:FolateFinasteride and dutasteride The following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or 
     their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known:
     
     Selenium and vitamin EDietMultivitaminsLycopene Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways 
    to prevent cancer. New ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical 
     trials. Age Family history of prostate cancer Race Hormones Vitamin E Folic acid Dairy and calcium Folate Finasteride and dutasteride Selenium and vitamin E Diet Multivitamins Lycopene Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, having overweight, and not getting enough exercise.  Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer. Prostate cancer is rare in men younger than 50 years of age.
			 The chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older. A man whose father, brother, or son has had prostate cancer has a
			 higher-than-average risk of  prostate cancer. Prostate cancer occurs more often in African American men than in White men. African American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than White men with prostate cancer. The prostate needs male hormones to work the way it should. The main
			 male sex hormone is testosterone.  Testosterone helps the body develop and maintain male sex characteristics. Testosterone is changed into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by an enzyme in the
			 body. DHT is important for normal prostate growth but can also cause the
			 prostate to get bigger and may play a part in the development of prostate cancer. The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) found that vitamin E taken alone increased the risk of prostate cancer. The risk continued even after the men stopped taking vitamin E. Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans, and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study  showed that the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took  1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid.      However, the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets. A diet high in dairy foods and calcium may cause a small increase in the risk of  prostate cancer. Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans, and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer   was lower in men who had enough folate  in their diets. However, the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid. Finasteride and dutasteride are drugs used to lower the amount of male sex hormones made by the body. These drugs block the enzyme that changes testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Higher than normal levels of DHT may play a part in developing prostate cancer. Taking finasteride or dutasteride has been shown to  lower the risk  for  prostate cancer, but it is not known  if  these drugs lower the risk of death from prostate cancer. The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) studied
				  whether the drug finasteride can prevent prostate cancer in healthy men 55
				  years of age and older. This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men    that took finasteride compared with the group of men that did not. The number of deaths from prostate cancer was  the same in both groups. Men who took finasteride reported more side effects compared with the group of men that did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, and enlarged breasts. In the PCPT, the men who took finasteride who did have prostate cancer had more aggressive tumors, but a follow-up analysis of the PCPT found that these men did not have more aggressive tumors. The Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events Trial (REDUCE) studied whether the drug dutasteride can prevent prostate cancer in men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk for the disease. This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men who took dutasteride compared with the group of men that did not. The number of less aggressive prostate cancers was lower, but the number of more aggressive prostate cancers was not. Men who took dutasteride reported more side effects than men who did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, less semen, and enlarged breasts. The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT)
				  studied whether taking vitamin E and selenium (a mineral) will prevent prostate cancer. The selenium and vitamin E were taken separately or together by healthy men 55 years of age and older
				  (50 years of age and older for African American men). The study showed  that taking selenium alone or selenium  and vitamin E together did not decrease the risk of prostate cancer. It is not known if  decreasing fat or  increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet helps decrease the risk of prostate cancer  or death from prostate cancer. In the PCPT trial, certain fatty acids  increased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer while others  decreased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Regular use of multivitamins  has not been proven to increase the risk of early or localized prostate cancer.  However, a large study showed an  increased risk of advanced  prostate cancer among men who took multivitamins more than seven times a week. Some studies have shown that a diet high in lycopene may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but other studies have not. It has not been proven that taking lycopene supplements decreases the risk of prostate cancer. Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to 
         lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some 
         cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who 
         have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. 
         Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had 
         cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type 
         or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. 
         Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known 
         to have any risk factors for cancer. The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to 
         find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These 
         may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting 
         smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or 
         food supplements. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish. PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about prostate cancer prevention.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board. A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

                        1:00 PM Add to Outlook Calendar Register Now The National Cancer Institute Center for Global Health (CGH) will host a session in collaboration with London Global Cancer Week (LGCW) 2022. This session will give an overview of three efforts to map and track global cancer research and research funding, led by the International Cancer Research Partnership (ICRP), WorldView (formerly World Report) hosted by the National Institutes of Health, and the NCI's Center for Global Health through the Global Oncology Survey of NCI-Designated Cancer Centers. Following an overview of each of these mapping efforts, there will be a case example of how data from these resources have been utilized to inform action and drive collaboration. The last portion of the session will be dedicated to a hands-on walkthrough of the resources, and an opportunity for participants to ask the experts about how to utilize these tools to develop research questions, seek training opportunities, identify funding sources, find potential collaborating partners, and more.    3. WorldView: an Atlas of Health Research Funding Hosted by the National Institutes of Health 4. NCI Global Oncology Survey of NCI-Designated Cancer Centers 5. Interactive Q&A and Discussion 6. Breakout Sessions:  Expert-led Interactive Database Exploration/”Office Hours" Participants will be able to join experts in separate virtual breakout rooms to learn more about the International Cancer Research Partnership (ICRP) and its database, with Dr. Lynne Davies and Dr. Panagiota Mitrou; WorldView and the WHO Global Health Observatory, with Michael Cheetham and Dr. Anna Laura Ross; and, the Global Oncology Survey of NCI-Designated Cancer Centers, with Elise Garton and Dr. Nabeel Zafar. 
 
This will allow participants to ask the experts questions directly about how to navigate the ICRP, WorldView, and WHO Global Health Observatory databases through an interactive walkthrough guided by participant interest and questions (e.g., how to use these resources to conduct a portfolio analysis, establish a research question, seek collaborations and training opportunities, etc.). 
 
In addition, Elise Garton will be available to share and discuss additional results of the Global Oncology Survey of NCI-Designated Cancer Centers, answer questions related to the methods and findings relevant to global cancer research funding and collaboration, and how this model could be replicated in other settings, as these types of survey can provide valuable data to understand the current state, priorities, and trends of global oncology.

T!tle : Researchers explore genetic effects of Chernobyl radiation - NCI

d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  2021 Press Releases  International research teams explore genetic effects of Chernobyl radiation   News Releases   Posted:
April 22, 2021  240-760-6600 Researchers have used DNA sequencing technology to explore scientific questions about the effects of radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on human health. In two landmark studies, researchers have used cutting-edge genomic tools to investigate the potential health effects of exposure to ionizing radiation, a known carcinogen, from the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine. One study found no evidence that radiation exposure to parents resulted in new genetic changes being passed from parent to child. The second study documented the genetic changes in the tumors of people who developed thyroid cancer after being exposed as children or fetuses to the radiation released by the accident. The findings, published around the 35th anniversary of the disaster, are from international teams of investigators led by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health. The studies were published online in Science on April 22. "Scientific questions about the effects of radiation on human health have been investigated since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and have been raised again by Chernobyl and by the nuclear accident that followed the tsunami in Fukushima, Japan," said Stephen J. Chanock, M.D., director of NCI’s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG). "In recent years, advances in DNA sequencing technology have enabled us to begin to address some of the important questions, in part through comprehensive genomic analyses carried out in well-designed epidemiological studies." The Chernobyl accident exposed millions of people in the surrounding region to radioactive contaminants. Studies have provided much of today’s knowledge about cancers caused by radiation exposures from nuclear power plant accidents. The new research builds on this foundation using next-generation DNA sequencing and other genomic characterization tools to analyze biospecimens from people in Ukraine who were affected by the disaster. The first study investigated the long-standing question of whether radiation exposure results in genetic changes that can be passed from parent to offspring, as has been suggested by some studies in animals. To answer this question, Dr. Chanock and his colleagues analyzed the complete genomes of 130 people born between 1987 and 2002 and their 105 mother-father pairs. One or both of the parents had been workers who helped clean up from the accident or had been evacuated because they lived in close proximity to the accident site. Each parent was evaluated for protracted exposure to ionizing radiation, which may have occurred through the consumption of contaminated milk (that is, milk from cows that grazed on pastures that had been contaminated by radioactive fallout). The mothers and fathers experienced a range of radiation doses. The researchers analyzed the genomes of adult children for an increase in a particular type of inherited genetic change known as de novo mutations. De novo mutations are genetic changes that arise randomly in a person’s gametes (sperm and eggs) and can be transmitted to their offspring but are not observed in the parents. For the range of radiation exposures experienced by the parents in the study, there was no evidence from the whole-genome sequencing data of an increase in the number or types of de novo mutations in their children born between 46 weeks and 15 years after the accident. The number of de novo mutations observed in these children were highly similar to those of the general population with comparable characteristics. As a result, the findings suggest that the ionizing radiation exposure from the accident had a minimal, if any, impact on the health of the subsequent generation. "We view these results as very reassuring for people who were living in Fukushima at the time of the accident in 2011," said Dr. Chanock. "The radiation doses in Japan are known to have been lower than those recorded at Chernobyl." In the second study, researchers used next-generation sequencing to profile the genetic changes in thyroid cancers that developed in 359 people exposed as children or in utero to ionizing radiation from radioactive iodine (I-131) released by the Chernobyl nuclear accident and in 81 unexposed individuals born more than nine months after the accident. Increased risk of thyroid cancer has been one of the most important adverse health effects observed after the accident. The energy from ionizing radiation breaks the chemical bonds in DNA, resulting in a number of different types of damage. The new study highlights the importance of a particular kind of DNA damage that involves breaks in both DNA strands in the thyroid tumors. The association between DNA double-strand breaks and radiation exposure was stronger for children exposed at younger ages. Next, the researchers identified the candidate "drivers" of the cancer in each tumor — the key genes in which alterations enabled the cancers to grow and survive. They identified the drivers in more than 95% of the tumors. Nearly all the alterations involved genes in the same signaling pathway, called the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, including the genes BRAF, RAS, and RET. The set of affected genes is similar to what has been reported in previous studies of thyroid cancer. However, the researchers observed a shift in the distribution of the types of mutations in the genes. Specifically, in the Chernobyl study, thyroid cancers that occurred in people exposed to higher radiation doses as children were more likely to result from gene fusions (when both strands of DNA are broken and then the wrong pieces are joined back together), whereas those in unexposed people or those exposed to low levels of radiation were more likely to result from point mutations (single base-pair changes in a key part of a gene). The results suggest that DNA double-strand breaks may be an early genetic change following exposure to radiation in the environment that subsequently enables the growth of thyroid cancers. Their findings provide a foundation for further studies of radiation-induced cancers, particularly those that involve differences in risk as a function of both dose and age, the researchers added. "An exciting aspect of this research was the opportunity to link the genomic characteristics of the tumor with information about the radiation dose — the risk factor that potentially caused the cancer," said Lindsay M. Morton, Ph.D., deputy chief of the Radiation Epidemiology Branch in DCEG, who led the study. "The Cancer Genome Atlas set the standard for how to comprehensively profile tumor characteristics," Dr. Morton continued. "We extended that approach to complete the first large genomic landscape study in which the potential carcinogenic exposure was well-characterized, enabling us to investigate the relationship between specific tumor characteristics and radiation dose." She noted that the study was made possible by the creation of the Chernobyl Tissue Bank about two decades ago — long before the technology had been developed to conduct the kind of genomic and molecular studies that are common today. "These studies represent the first time our group has done molecular studies using the biospecimens that were collected by our colleagues in Ukraine," Dr. Morton said. "The tissue bank was set up by visionary scientists to collect tumor samples from residents in highly contaminated regions who developed thyroid cancer. These scientists recognized that there would be substantial advances in technology in the future, and the research community is now benefiting from their foresight."

The GI tract includes the stomach and intestines (bowels). Food moves from the throat to the stomach through a  tube called the esophagus. After food enters the stomach, it is broken down by stomach muscles that mix the food and liquid with digestive juices. After leaving the stomach, partly digested food passes into the small intestine and then into the large intestine. The end of the large intestine, called the rectum, stores the waste from the digested food until it is pushed out of the anus during a bowel movement. GI complications refer to a range of problems that can affect the digestive system. GI complications are common in people with cancer and may be caused by the cancer itself, or it can be an effect of cancer treatment or the medicines used to manage symptoms. Children and adults with cancer may experience similar types of GI complications, but the causes and treatment approaches differ based on age and other factors. This page describes the following GI complications in adults,  their causes, and treatments: constipation fecal impaction bowel obstruction diarrhea radiation enteritis Constipation is a condition in which bowel movements are difficult or painful to pass and don't happen very often. Constipation is a common problem for people with cancer. Assessment of constipation includes a health history, physical exam, and other tests. It is important to prevent and treat constipation to avoid serious problems. Constipation is caused by the slow movement of stool through the large intestine. As the stool slowly moves through the large intestine, it loses fluid and becomes harder. A person with constipation may be unable to have a bowel movement, have to push harder to have a  bowel movement, or have  infrequent bowel movements. There is no "normal" number of bowel movements for a person with cancer. Each person is different. However, if you have infrequent bowel movements, you may be constipated. Common causes of constipation include older age, changes in diet and fluid intake,   and not getting enough exercise. In addition to these  common causes of constipation, other causes in people with cancer include: Medicines. Chemotherapy, opioids, antidepressants, antacids, and diuretics can cause constipation by affecting the nerves and muscles in the digestive tract, slowing down bowel movements. Changes in your bathroom habits. You may have little or no privacy and need help to get to the bathroom. Limited mobility. Long periods of inactivity due to cancer can cause constipation. Bowel disorders. This includes disorders such as irritable bowel and diverticulitis. Muscle and nerve disorders.  A spinal cord injury or pressure on the spinal cord from a tumor can cause constipation. Metabolic changes. Some cancers can affect your appetite and ability to absorb, store, and use nutrients. Depression. Depression can lead to lower levels of activity and changes in bodily functions. Constipation can also be a side effect of medicines that treat depression. The following tests and procedures may be done to help diagnose constipation: Health history: A discussion with your doctor about your bowel habits, including frequency, stool consistency, and whether you are experiencing symptoms such as pain, bloating, or nausea when you are constipated. The doctor will also ask about your diet, fluid intake, and medicines you are taking and whether there have been recent changes in any of these areas. For people who have colostomies, care of the colostomy will be discussed. Physical exam: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. The doctor will check the abdomen to see if it is swollen, listen for bowel sounds, and feel for painful areas in the abdomen. If the cause of the constipation isn't clear from the health history and physical exam, your doctor may order more tests to find out if another problem is causing the constipation: Digital rectal exam (DRE): An exam of the rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. In women, the vagina may also be examined. Fecal occult blood test: A test to check stool for blood that can only be seen with a microscope. Small samples of stool are placed on special cards and returned to the doctor or laboratory for testing.EnlargeA guaiac fecal occult blood test (FOBT) checks for occult (hidden) blood in the stool. Small samples of stool are placed on a special card and returned to a doctor or laboratory for testing. Abdominal x-ray: An x-ray of the organs inside the abdomen. An x-ray is a type of high-energy radiation that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. Sigmoidoscopy: A procedure to look inside the rectum and sigmoid (lower) colon for  polyps, abnormal areas, or cancer. A sigmoidoscope  is inserted through the rectum into the sigmoid colon.  A sigmoidoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a  tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. Colonoscopy: A procedure to look inside the rectum and colon for polyps, abnormal areas, or cancer. A colonoscope is inserted through the rectum into the colon. A colonoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.EnlargeColonoscopy.  A thin, lighted tube is inserted through the anus and rectum and into the colon to look for abnormal areas. The health care team will talk to you about ways to prevent and treat constipation. Constipation can be uncomfortable and cause distress. If left untreated, constipation may lead to fecal impaction. This is a serious condition in which stool will not pass out of the colon or rectum.   

It's important to treat constipation to prevent fecal impaction. Prevention and treatment of constipation are not the same for every person. Keep track of how often you have a bowel movement and do the following to prevent and treat constipation: Drink more fluid each day unless you have a medical condition that restricts fluid intake. Get regular exercise. People who cannot walk may do abdominal exercises in bed or move from the bed to a chair. Increase the amount of fiber in the diet. It's important to  drink more fluids when eating more high-fiber foods, to avoid making constipation worse. People who have had a small or large    intestinal obstruction or have had intestinal surgery (for example, a colostomy) should not eat a high-fiber diet. Drink a warm or hot drink about one half-hour before the usual time for a bowel movement. Find privacy and quiet when it is time for a bowel movement. Use the toilet or a bedside commode instead of a bedpan. People who take opioids may need to start taking laxatives right away to prevent constipation. Other drugs may be given to prevent constipation. People at risk of bleeding or infection should talk with their doctor before using suppositories or enemas. Fecal impaction is a severe form of constipation in which dry, hard stool  cannot pass out of the colon or rectum. Fecal impaction and constipation share similar symptoms, but fecal impaction may cause other severe symptoms, such as breathing problems, dizziness, or low blood pressure. Assessment of constipation includes a health history, physical exam, and other tests. Fecal impaction is usually treated with an enema. Fecal impaction is dry stool that  cannot pass out of the body.  Constipation that is not treated can lead to fecal impaction. For this reason, the causes of fecal impaction are the same as those of constipation. To learn more, see the section on causes of constipation. Symptoms of fecal impaction include: being unable to have a bowel movement having to push harder to have a  bowel movement of small amounts of hard, dry stool having fewer than the usual number of bowel movements having a swollen abdomen having pain in the back or abdomen urinating more or less often than usual, or being unable to urinate having breathing problems having a rapid heartbeat or chest pain dizziness  or low blood pressure having sudden, explosive diarrhea (as stool moves around the impaction) leaking stool when coughing nausea and vomiting dehydration being confused and losing a sense of time and place, with a rapid heartbeat, sweating, fever,     and high or low blood pressure It’s important to talk with your health care provider if you have these symptoms. The following tests and procedures may be done to help diagnose fecal impaction: Health history: A discussion with your doctor about your bowel habits, including frequency, stool consistency, and whether you are experiencing symptoms such as pain, bloating, or nausea when you are constipated. The doctor will also ask about your diet, fluid intake, and medicines you are taking and whether there have been recent changes in any of these areas. Physical exam: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual.  The doctor will check the abdomen to see if it is swollen, listen for bowel sounds, and feel for painful areas in the abdomen. Abdominal x-rays:  An x-ray of the organs inside the abdomen. An x-ray is a type of high energy radiation that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body to check for fecal impaction. Digital rectal exam (DRE): An exam of the rectum.  The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for a fecal impaction, lumps, or anything else that seems unusual. Sigmoidoscopy: A procedure to look inside the rectum and sigmoid (lower) colon for a fecal impaction, polyps, abnormal areas, or cancer. A sigmoidoscope  is inserted through the rectum into the sigmoid colon.  A sigmoidoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a  tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. EnlargeSigmoidoscopy.  A thin, lighted tube is inserted through the anus and rectum and into the lower part of the colon to look for abnormal areas. The main treatment for impaction is to moisten and soften the stool so it can be removed or passed out of the body. This is  usually done  with an enema. Enemas are given only as prescribed by the doctor to reduce the risk of bleeding or infection for patients with low blood counts and because too many enemas can damage the intestine. Some people may need to have stool manually removed from the rectum after it is softened. A bowel obstruction is a blockage of the small or large intestine by something other than fecal impaction. A bowel obstruction can cause pain. Assessment of a bowel obstruction includes a physical exam and imaging tests. Treatment for acute bowel obstruction may include surgery. Treatment of a chronic, malignant bowel obstruction may include surgery to improve quality of life. A bowel obstruction (blockage) may be caused by a twist in an intestine, a hernia, inflammation, scar tissue from surgery, or cancer. The obstruction keeps the stool from moving through the small or large intestines. The intestine may be partly or completely blocked and can sometimes be blocked in two places. A bowel obstruction may cause decreased blood flow to an area of the intestines. Blood flow needs to be corrected or the affected tissue may die. Cancers in the stomach, colon, and ovary can spread to the abdomen and cause an obstruction. People with these cancers or those who have had surgery or radiation therapy to the abdomen have a higher risk of a bowel obstruction. Bowel obstructions are most common during the advanced stages of cancer. The following may be symptoms of a bowel obstruction: abdominal pain or cramps swelling in the abdomen constipation diarrhea nausea or vomiting problems passing gas loss of appetite It's important to talk with your health care provider if you have these symptoms. The following tests and procedures may be done to diagnose a bowel obstruction: Physical exam: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:  
the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and plateletsthe amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cellsthe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells Electrolyte panel: A blood test that measures the levels of electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and chloride. Urinalysis:  A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, red blood cells, and white blood cells. CT scan (CAT scan): This procedure uses a computer linked to an x-ray machine to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen, taken from different angles. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Abdominal x-ray: An x-ray of the organs inside the abdomen. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. Barium enema: A series of x-rays of the lower gastrointestinal tract. A liquid that contains barium (a silver-white metallic compound) is put into the rectum. The barium coats the lower gastrointestinal tract and x-rays are taken.  This procedure is also called a lower GI series. This test may show what part of the intestine is blocked.  EnlargeBarium enema procedure.  The patient lies on an x-ray table. Barium liquid is put into the rectum and flows through the colon.  X-rays are taken to look for abnormal areas. the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells the portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells Acute bowel obstructions occur suddenly and  can be treated. Treatment may include the following: Fluid replacement therapy: A treatment to get the fluids in the body back to normal amounts.  Intravenous (IV) fluids may be given and medicines may be prescribed. Electrolyte correction: A treatment to get the right amounts of chemicals in the blood, such as sodium, potassium, and  chloride. Fluids with electrolytes may be given by infusion. Blood transfusion:    A procedure in which a person is given an infusion of whole blood or parts of blood. Bowel rest: Food and sometimes fluid are held to give the intestines time to heal. Nasogastric or colorectal tube: A nasogastric tube is inserted through the nose and esophagus into the stomach.  A colorectal tube is inserted through the rectum into the colon. This  is done to decrease swelling, remove fluid and gas buildup, and relieve pressure. Stents: A metal tube inserted into the intestine to open the area that is blocked to relieve symptoms caused by the blockage. Surgery: Surgery to relieve  the obstruction may be done if it causes serious symptoms that are not relieved by other treatments. People with symptoms that keep getting worse will have follow-up exams to check for signs and symptoms of shock and to make sure the obstruction isn't getting worse. Chronic, malignant bowel obstructions may worsen over time. People with advanced cancer may have chronic bowel obstructions that cannot be removed with surgery. The intestine may be blocked or narrowed in more than one place or the tumor may be too  large to remove completely. Treatments include the following: Surgery: The obstruction is removed to relieve pain and improve the patient's quality of life. Stent: A metal tube inserted into the intestine to open the area that is blocked to relieve symptoms and improve the patient’s quality of life. Gastrostomy tube: A tube inserted through the wall of the abdomen directly into the stomach. The gastrostomy tube can be attached to a drainage bag with a valve. When the valve is open the built-up fluid and air can leave the stomach to relieve symptoms caused by the obstruction. People may also be able to eat or drink by mouth because the food drains directly into the bag. This gives the person the experience of tasting the food and keeping the mouth moist. Solid food is avoided because it may block the tubing to the drainage bag. If the person has an obstruction that is not completely blocking the intestine, they may also use the gastrostomy tube to pour medications directly into the stomach. Medicines: Injections or infusions of medicines for pain, nausea and vomiting, and/or to make the intestines empty. This may be prescribed for people who cannot have surgery or be helped with a stent or gastrostomy tube. Diarrhea is frequent, loose, and watery bowel movements. Cancer treatment is the most common cause of diarrhea in people with cancer. Assessment of diarrhea includes  a health history, physical exam, and lab tests. Treatment of diarrhea depends on what is causing it. Acute diarrhea is three or more loose or watery bowel movements in one day. Acute diarrhea may last more than 4 days but less than 2 weeks. Frequent, watery stools that last for more than 2 months is called chronic diarrhea. Diarrhea can occur at any time during cancer treatment. It can be physically and emotionally stressful for people with cancer. Causes of diarrhea in people with cancer include the following: Cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, bone marrow transplant, and surgery.Some chemotherapy and targeted therapy drugs cause diarrhea by changing how nutrients are broken down and absorbed in the small intestine. Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that helps your immune system fight cancer. As it attacks cancer cells, it  also attacks healthy cells and tissues.  This may result in diarrhea.Radiation therapy to the abdomen and pelvis can cause inflammation  of the bowel. Diarrhea may last up to 8 to 12 weeks after treatment  or may not happen for months or years. People who are having radiation therapy and chemotherapy often have severe diarrhea.People who have a donor bone marrow transplant may develop graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Stomach and intestinal symptoms of GVHD include nausea and vomiting, severe abdominal pain and cramps, and watery, green diarrhea. Symptoms may show up 1 week to 3 months after the transplant. Surgery on the stomach or intestines. The cancer itself. Stress and anxiety from being diagnosed with cancer and having cancer treatment. Medical conditions and diseases other than cancer. Infections. Antibiotic therapy for certain infections. Antibiotic therapy can irritate the lining of the bowel and cause diarrhea that often does not get better with treatment. Tubefeeding. Fecal impaction in which the stool leaks around the blockage. Certain foods such as milk products, fruits, vegetables, and foods that are high in fiber or fat. Some chemotherapy and targeted therapy drugs cause diarrhea by changing how nutrients are broken down and absorbed in the small intestine. Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that helps your immune system fight cancer. As it attacks cancer cells, it  also attacks healthy cells and tissues.  This may result in diarrhea. Radiation therapy to the abdomen and pelvis can cause inflammation  of the bowel. Diarrhea may last up to 8 to 12 weeks after treatment  or may not happen for months or years. People who are having radiation therapy and chemotherapy often have severe diarrhea. People who have a donor bone marrow transplant may develop graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Stomach and intestinal symptoms of GVHD include nausea and vomiting, severe abdominal pain and cramps, and watery, green diarrhea. Symptoms may show up 1 week to 3 months after the transplant. Surgery on the stomach or intestines. Diarrhea can cause life-threatening complications in people with cancer. It is important to find out the cause so treatment can begin as soon as possible. The following tests and procedures may be done to diagnose diarrhea and help plan treatment: Health history: A discussion with your doctor about your urine habits and bowel habits, including frequency, stool consistency, and whether you are experiencing symptoms such as dizziness, drowsiness, pain, nausea and vomiting, or fever. The doctor will also ask about your recent diet and fluid intake, recent travels, and medicines you are taking and how often. Physical exam: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. The doctor will check the abdomen for painful areas and listen for bowel sounds. Digital rectal exam (DRE): An exam of the rectum.  The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. The exam will check for signs of fecal impaction. Stool may be collected for laboratory tests. Fecal occult blood test: A test to check stool for blood that can only be seen with a microscope.  Small samples of stool are placed on special cards and returned to the doctor or laboratory for testing. Stool tests: Laboratory tests to check the water and sodium  levels in stool, and to find substances that may be causing diarrhea. Stool is also checked for bacterial, fungal, or viral infections. Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:  
the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and plateletsthe amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cellsthe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells Electrolyte panel: A blood test that measures the levels of electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and chloride.

Abdominal x-rays may also be done to look for a  bowel obstruction or other problems. the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells the portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells Treatment depends on the cause of the diarrhea. The doctor may make changes to your medicines, diet, and/or fluids. Treatment of diarrhea may include the following: A change in the use of laxatives may be needed. Medicine to treat diarrhea may be prescribed to slow down the intestines, decrease fluid secreted by the intestines, and help nutrients  be absorbed. Diarrhea caused by cancer treatment may be treated by changes in diet. Eat small frequent meals and avoid the following foods:milk and dairy productsspicy foods 
alcoholfoods and drinks that have caffeine
certain fruit juices 
foods and drinks that cause gas 
foods high in fiber or fat Drink more clear liquids to help stay hydrated. These include water, sports drinks, broth, weak decaffeinated tea, caffeine-free soft drinks, clear juices, and gelatin. For severe diarrhea, the person may need intravenous (IV) fluids or other forms of IV nutrition. Diarrhea caused by graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is often treated with a special diet. Some people may need long-term treatment and diet management. Probiotics may be suggested. Probiotics are live microorganisms used as a dietary supplement to help with digestion and normal bowel function. Research on the use of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium has reported benefits in treating diarrhea. People who have diarrhea with other symptoms may need fluids  and medicine given by IV. milk and dairy products spicy foods alcohol foods and drinks that have caffeine certain fruit juices foods and drinks that cause gas foods high in fiber or fat Radiation enteritis is inflammation of the intestine caused by radiation therapy. The total dose of radiation and other factors affect the risk of radiation enteritis. Acute and chronic radiation enteritis have similar symptoms. Assessment of radiation enteritis includes a physical exam and health history. Treatment of acute radiation enteritis includes treating the symptoms. Treatment of chronic radiation enteritis may include the same treatments for acute radiation enteritis. The small and large intestine are  sensitive to radiation. Radiation therapy given to kill cancer cells in the abdomen and pelvis affects normal cells in the lining of the intestines. Radiation therapy stops the growth of cancer cells and other fast-growing cells. Since normal cells in the lining of the intestines grow quickly, radiation treatment to that area can stop those cells from growing. This makes it hard for tissue to repair itself. As cells die and are not replaced, gastrointestinal problems occur over the next few days and weeks. Radiation enteritis is a condition in which the lining of the intestine  becomes swollen and inflamed during or after radiation therapy to the abdomen, pelvis, or rectum. The larger the dose of radiation, the more damage may be done to normal tissue. Radiation enteritis may be acute or chronic: Acute radiation enteritis occurs during radiation therapy or within three months after finishing radiation therapy. Chronic radiation enteritis may appear months after radiation therapy ends. The amount of time the enteritis lasts and how severe it is depend on the following: the type and total dose of radiation received the amount of normal intestine treated the tumor size and how much it has spread if chemotherapy was given at the same time as the radiation therapy if the person has had surgery to the abdomen or pelvis if the person has high blood pressure, diabetes, a smoking history, or poor nutrition About 10% to 20% of people treated with radiation to the abdomen will have chronic problems. People with acute radiation enteritis may have the following symptoms: nausea vomiting abdominal cramps frequent urges to have a bowel movement rectal pain, bleeding, or mucus in the stool watery diarrhea feeling very tired Symptoms of acute enteritis usually go away 2 to 3 weeks after treatment ends. Symptoms  of chronic radiation enteritis usually appear 6 to 18 months after radiation therapy ends. It can be hard to diagnose. The doctor will first check to see if the symptoms are being caused by a recurrent tumor in the intestine. The doctor will also need to know the person's full history of radiation treatments. People with chronic radiation enteritis may have the following signs and symptoms: abdominal pain bloody diarrhea greasy and fatty stools weight loss nausea vomiting It's important to talk with your health care provider if you have these symptoms. A doctor will do a physical exam and ask questions about the following: usual pattern of bowel movements pattern of diarrhea:when it startedhow long it has lastedhow often it occursamount and type of stoolsother symptoms with the diarrhea (such as gas, cramping, bloating, urgency, bleeding, and rectal soreness) nutrition health: height and weightusual eating habitschanges in eating habitsamount of fiber in the dietsigns of dehydration (such as poor skin tone, increased weakness, or feeling very tired) stress levels and ability to cope changes in lifestyle caused by the enteritis when it started how long it has lasted how often it occurs amount and type of stools other symptoms with the diarrhea (such as gas, cramping, bloating, urgency, bleeding, and rectal soreness) height and weight usual eating habits changes in eating habits amount of fiber in the diet signs of dehydration (such as poor skin tone, increased weakness, or feeling very tired) The symptoms of radiation enteritis usually get better with treatment, but if symptoms get worse, then cancer treatment may have to be stopped for a while. Treatment of acute radiation enteritis or the symptoms may include: anti-inflammatory medicines that improve the flow of blood through the body antibiotics steroids medicines to stop diarrhea and to lower cholesterol in the blood vitamin E probiotic diet changes Intestines damaged by radiation therapy may not make enough of certain enzymes needed for digestion, especially lactase. Lactase is needed to digest lactose, which is found in milk and milk products. A lactose-free, low-fat, and low-fiber diet may help control symptoms of acute enteritis. Foods to avoid:milk and some milk productswhole-bran bread and cerealnuts, seeds, and coconutfried, greasy, or fatty foodsfresh and dried fruit and some fruit juices (such as prune juice)raw vegetablesrich pastriespopcorn, potato chips, and pretzelsstrong spices and herbschocolate, coffee, tea, and soft drinks with caffeinealcohol and tobaccoFoods to choose:fish, poultry, and meat that are broiled or roastedbananasapplesauce and peeled applesapple and grape juiceswhite bread and toastpastabaked, boiled, or mashed potatoescooked vegetables that are mild, such as asparagus tips, green and waxed beans, carrots, spinach, and squashmild processed cheese, which may not cause problems because the lactose is removed when it is madebuttermilk, yogurt, and lactose-free milkshake supplements, such as Ensureeggssmooth peanut butterHelpful hints:Eat food at room temperature. 
Drink about 12 eight-ounce glasses of fluid a day. 
Let sodas lose their fizz before drinking them. 
Add nutmeg to food. This helps slow down movement of  digested food in the intestines. 
Start a low-fiber diet on the first day of radiation therapy. Intestines damaged by radiation therapy may not make enough of certain enzymes needed for digestion, especially lactase.

Start a low-fiber diet on the first day of radiation therapy. Treatment of chronic radiation enteritis may include the following: same  treatments as for acute radiation enteritis symptoms surgery may be needed to control symptoms in some patients. Two types of surgery may be used:Intestinal bypass: A procedure in which the doctor creates a new pathway for the flow of intestinal contents around the damaged tissue.Total intestinal resection: Surgery to completely remove the intestines. Doctors look at the person's general health and the amount of damaged tissue before deciding if surgery will be needed. Healing after surgery  is often slow and long-term tubefeeding may be needed. Even after surgery, many people still have symptoms. Intestinal bypass: A procedure in which the doctor creates a new pathway for the flow of intestinal contents around the damaged tissue. Total intestinal resection: Surgery to completely remove the intestines. Use our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        about constipation or diarrhea, see the following: Constipation and Cancer Treatment Diarrhea and Cancer Treatment Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish. PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the causes and treatment of gastrointestinal complications, including constipation, impaction, bowel obstruction, diarrhea, and radiation enteritis.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board. A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

It   is a time when many decisions about treatment and care are  made for people with cancer. It is important for  families and healthcare providers to talk openly with the person about their end-of-life plans and know their wishes ahead of time. This will make it easier for family members to make major decisions for the person at the end of life. When treatment choices and plans are discussed before the end of life, it can lower the stress on both the patient and the family.   It is most helpful if end-of life planning and decision-making begin soon after the cancer is diagnosed and continue during the course of the disease. Having these decisions in writing can make the person's wishes clear to both the family and the healthcare team. When a child is terminally ill, end-of-life discussions with the child's doctor may reduce the time the child spends in the hospital and help the parents feel more prepared. This summary is about end of life in adults with cancer and, where noted, children with cancer. It discusses care during the last days and last hours of life, including treatment of common symptoms and ethical questions that may come up. It may help patients and their families prepare for decisions they must make during this time. For more information on end-of-life planning, including palliative and hospice care, see Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care in Advanced Cancer. Knowing what to expect in the final days or hours helps comfort the family. People may not want to eat or drink in the final days or hours. People near death may not respond to others. A number of physical changes are common when a person is near death. Cultural or religious beliefs and customs may be important at the time of death. Most people don't know the signs that show death is near. Knowing what to expect can help them get ready for the death of their loved one and make this time less stressful and confusing. Healthcare providers can give family members information about the changes they may see in their loved one in the final hours and how they may help their loved one through this. In the final days to hours of life, people often lose the desire to eat or drink, and may not want food and fluids that are offered to them. The family may give ice chips or swab the mouth and lips to keep them moist. Food and fluids should not be forced on the person because it can cause discomfort or choking. People may withdraw and spend more time sleeping. They may answer questions slowly or not at all, seem confused, and may not be interested in what's going on around them. Most people are still able to hear after they are no longer able to speak.  It may give some comfort if family members continue to touch and talk to the person, even if they do not respond. Certain physical changes may occur in a person at the end of life: They may feel tired or weak. They may pass less urine, and it may be dark in color. Their hands and feet may become blotchy, cold, or blue. Caregivers can use blankets to keep the person warm. Electric blankets or heating pads should not be used. Their heart rate may go up or down and become irregular. Blood pressure usually goes down. Breathing may become irregular, with very shallow breathing, short periods of not breathing, or deep, rapid breathing. However, these  signs and changes don't always occur in everyone. For this reason, it may be hard to know  when a person is near death. After a person dies, family members and caregivers may wish to stay with them awhile. There may be certain customs or rituals that are important to the person and family at this time. These might include rituals for coping with death, handling the person's body, making final arrangements for the body, and honoring the death. It’s important to let the healthcare team know what customs or rituals are important to the person and their family after the person’s death. Healthcare providers, hospice staff, social workers, or spiritual leaders can explain the steps that need to be taken once death has occurred, including contacting a funeral home. For more information, see Spirituality in Cancer Care. DeliriumDelirium can have many causes at the end of life.Delirium may be controlled by finding and treating the cause.Hallucinations that are not related to delirium often occur at the end of life. FatigueFatigue is one of the most common symptoms in the last days of life. Shortness of BreathFeeling short of breath is  common and may get worse during the final days or weeks of life.The use of opioids and other methods can help the person breathe more easily. PainPain medicines can be given in several ways.Pain during the final hours of life can usually be controlled. CoughCough at the end of life can be treated in several ways. ConstipationConstipation may occur  in the last days of life. Trouble SwallowingPeople may have trouble swallowing food and fluids at the end of life. Death RattleRattle occurs when saliva or other fluids collect in the throat and upper airways.Non-drug treatments for rattle include changing the person's position and giving less   fluid.Death rattle is a sign that death may soon occur. Myoclonic JerkingMyoclonic jerks  may be caused by taking very high doses of opioids for a long time. FeverFever may be caused by infection, medicines, or the cancer itself. HemorrhageSudden hemorrhage (heavy bleeding) may occur in people who have certain cancers or disorders.Making the person comfortable  is the main goal of care during hemorrhage at the end of life. Delirium can have many causes at the end of life. Delirium may be controlled by finding and treating the cause. Hallucinations that are not related to delirium often occur at the end of life. Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms in the last days of life. Feeling short of breath is  common and may get worse during the final days or weeks of life. The use of opioids and other methods can help the person breathe more easily. Pain medicines can be given in several ways. Pain during the final hours of life can usually be controlled. Cough at the end of life can be treated in several ways. Constipation may occur  in the last days of life. People may have trouble swallowing food and fluids at the end of life. Rattle occurs when saliva or other fluids collect in the throat and upper airways. Non-drug treatments for rattle include changing the person's position and giving less   fluid. Death rattle is a sign that death may soon occur. Myoclonic jerks  may be caused by taking very high doses of opioids for a long time. Fever may be caused by infection, medicines, or the cancer itself. Sudden hemorrhage (heavy bleeding) may occur in people who have certain cancers or disorders. Making the person comfortable  is the main goal of care during hemorrhage at the end of life. Common symptoms at the end of life include the following: delirium feeling very tired shortness of breath pain coughing constipation trouble swallowing rattle sound with breathing myoclonic jerks fever hemorrhage Delirium is common during the final days of life. Most people have a lower  level of consciousness. They may be withdrawn, be less alert, and have less energy. Some people may be agitated or restless, and have  hallucinations (see or hear things not really there). People near death should be protected from having accidents or hurting themselves when they are confused or agitated. Delirium can be caused by the direct effects of cancer, such as a growing tumor in the brain. Other causes include the following: A higher- or lower-than-normal amount of certain chemicals in the blood  that keep the heart, kidneys, nerves, and muscles working the way they should. Side effects of drugs or drug interactions (changes in the way a drug acts in the body when taken with certain other drugs, herbal medicine, or foods). Stopping the use of certain drugs or alcohol. Dehydration (the loss of needed water from the body). Depending on the cause of the delirium, doctors may do the following: Give drugs to fix the level of certain chemicals in the blood. Stop or lower the dose of the drugs that are causing delirium, or are no longer useful at the end of life, such as drugs to lower cholesterol. Treat dehydration by putting fluids into the bloodstream. For some people in the last hours of life, the decision may be to  treat only the symptoms of delirium and make the person as comfortable as possible.








There are drugs that work very well to relieve these symptoms. It is common for people near death to have  hallucinations that include loved ones who have already died. It is normal for family members to feel distress when  these hallucinations occur. Speaking  with clergy, the hospital chaplain, or other  religious advisors may help. Fatigue (feeling very tired) is one of the most common symptoms in the last days of life. A person's fatigue may become worse every day during this time. Drowsiness, weakness, and sleep problems may occur.          Drugs that increase brain activity, alertness, and energy may be helpful.      For more information, see Cancer Fatigue. Shortness of breath or not being able to catch your breath is often caused by advanced cancer. Other causes include the following: build-up of fluid in the abdomen loss of muscle strength hypoxemia (a condition in which there is not enough oxygen in the blood) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pneumonia infection Opioids may relieve shortness of breath in people near death. Other drugs, such as bronchodilators or steroids may be considered if they are in line with the person’s goals of care. Other ways to help people who feel short of breath include the following: Give extra oxygen if    shortness of breath is caused by hypoxemia. Aim a cool fan toward their face. Have them sit up. Give antibiotics if  the shortness of breath is caused by an infection. In the last days of life, a person may not be able to swallow pain medicine. When medicines cannot be taken by mouth, the pain medicine may be given by injection or infusion. These methods can be used at home with a doctor's order. Opioid analgesics work very well to relieve  pain and are commonly used at the end of life. Some patients and family members worry that the use of opioids may cause death to occur sooner, but studies have shown no link between opioid use and early death. For more information about opioids, see Cancer Pain. Cough at the end of life may add to a person's discomfort. Repeated coughing can cause pain and loss of sleep, increase tiredness, and make shortness of breath worse. At the end of life, the decision may be to  treat the symptoms of the cough rather than to find and treat the cause. The following types of drugs may be used to make the person as comfortable as possible: Over-the-counter cough medicines with expectorants to increase bronchial fluids and loosen mucus. Medicines to decrease mucus production that can cause coughing in people who have trouble swallowing. Opioids to stop the coughing. For more information, see Cardiopulmonary Syndromes. People with cancer may have constipation in the last days of life. People  who have trouble swallowing may not be able to take laxatives by mouth to treat the constipation. If needed, laxatives may be given rectally to make them comfortable. People with cancer may have trouble swallowing in the last days of life. Both fluids and food may be hard to swallow, causing a  loss of appetite, weight loss  and muscle wasting, and weakness. Small amounts of food that the person enjoys may be given if they want to eat. Supplemental nutrition does not benefit patients in the last days of life and may increase the risk of aspiration and infections. When the person cannot swallow, medicine may be given by placing it in the rectum, giving it by injection or infusion, or by placing a patch on the skin. Rattle occurs when saliva or other fluids build up in the throat and airways in a person who is too weak to clear the throat. There are two types of rattle. Death rattle is caused by saliva pooling at the back of the throat. The other kind of rattle is caused by fluid in the airways from an infection, a tumor, aspiration, or extra fluid in body tissues. Drugs may be given to decrease the amount of saliva in the mouth or to dry the upper airway. Raising the head of the bed, propping the person up with pillows, or turning them to either side often relieves rattle. If the rattle is caused by fluid at the back of the throat, the fluid may be gently removed from the mouth using a suction tube. Death rattle is a sign that death may occur in hours or days. Rattle can be very upsetting for those at the bedside. It  does not seem to be painful for the person and is not the same as shortness of breath. Myoclonic jerks are sudden muscle twitches or jerks that cannot be controlled by the person having them. A hiccup is one type of myoclonic jerk.  Brief, shock-like jerks can occur in one or more different muscle groups anywhere in the body. Taking very high doses of an opioid for a long time may cause this side effect, but it can have other causes as well. When opioids are the cause of myoclonic jerking, changing to another opioid may help. People respond to opioids in different ways, and certain opioids may be more likely than others to cause myoclonic jerking in some people. When a person is very near death, medicine to stop the myoclonic jerking may be given instead of changing the opioid. When  myoclonic jerking is severe, drugs may be used to calm the person down, relieve anxiety, and help them sleep. Treatment of fever in the last days of life depends on whether it causes the  person distress or discomfort. Fever may be caused by  infection, medicines, or the cancer itself.  Although  infections may be treated with antibiotics, people near the end of life may choose not to treat the  cause of the fever. Hemorrhage (heavy bleeding in a short time) is rare but may occur in the last hours or minutes of life.  Blood vessels may be damaged by certain cancers or cancer treatments. Radiation therapy, for example, can  weaken blood vessels in the area that was treated. Tumors can also damage blood vessels. People with the following conditions have an increased risk of hemorrhage: advanced cancer, especially head and neck cancers ulcers mucositis caused by chemotherapy blood clotting disorders The person and family should talk with the doctor about any concerns they have about the chance of hemorrhage. It is hard to know when hemorrhage might occur.   When sudden bleeding occurs at the end of life, people usually become  unconscious and die soon afterwards. Resuscitation (restarting the heart) usually will not work. The main goal of care is to make the person comfortable and to support family members. If hemorrhage occurs, it can be very upsetting, and it may be helpful for the family to ask questions about it and talk about their feelings with one another and their care team. Decisions about Chemotherapy Decisions about Targeted Therapy Decisions about Immunotherapy Decisions about Hospice Decisions about Place of Death Decisions about whether to continue or stop chemotherapy are made by the patient and doctor together. About one-third of people with advanced cancer continue to receive chemotherapy or other treatment near the end of life. Treatment with  chemotherapy  at this time  can result in the following: serious side  effects spending more days  in the hospital spending the last days of life in an intensive care unit However, some people with cancer choose to continue chemotherapy because they feel it helps them to live  in  the present and  focus on active treatment. Other people choose palliative or comfort care to  treat pain and other symptoms. These decisions are based on   the person's goals of care and the likely  risks and benefits of treatment. Decisions about whether to continue or stop targeted therapy are made by the patient and doctor together. Targeted therapies may help people with tumors that have spread to other areas in the body. Treatment with targeted therapy at the end of life can result in the following: spending the last days of life  in a hospital poor awareness of prognosis less time to prepare for the end of life Decisions about whether to continue or stop immunotherapy are made by the patient and doctor together. Many people taking immunotherapy are older or are no longer helped by chemotherapy, but these drugs may still have unwanted side effects. Treatment with immunotherapy at the end of life can result in the following: being less likely to use hospice services spending the last days of life in the hospital having  problems related to medical costs (financial toxicity) Hospice care is an important end-of-life option for people with advanced cancer. People may feel that beginning hospice care means they have given up. Some people fear   losing the relationship with their oncologist. However, many patients and caregivers feel they receive important benefits from hospice care. People who receive hospice care seem to have the following: better mental outlook better relief of symptoms better communication better end-of-life care more days spent at home less stressful death (without causing death to happen sooner) Hospice-related services include: visiting nurse chaplain counselor home health aide respite care Doctors, patients, and caregivers should discuss hospice care and when it should begin. When hospice benefits are covered by Medicare, physicians are required to certify that  the person is not expected to live more than 6 months and is not being treated to be cured. Other policies may be different, depending on the hospice and  the state. Many people with advanced cancer wish to  die at home. People who die at home with hospice services and support seem to have better symptom control and quality of life. They also feel better prepared for death  than people who die in a hospital or intensive care unit. Grieving caregivers have less trouble adjusting to their loss and feel they have honored the person's wishes when their loved one dies at home. People who get hospice care are more likely to be able to die at home.  Hospice care can help control the person's symptoms and give the caregiver the help  they need. However, not all people choose to die at home. It is important for the person, caregivers, and doctors to discuss where the person wants to die and the best way to fulfill   the person's decision. For children with advanced cancer, families and doctors should discuss wishes for the place of death early in the course of the disease. Children who die in the hospital may have more intense treatments and their parents may have more complicated grief than those of children who die at home. In the last days of life, patients and family members will have to make decisions about treatments to keep the person alive. Choices about care and treatment at the end of life should be made while the person is able to make them. Care that supports a person's spiritual health may improve quality of life. FluidsThe goals of giving fluids at the end of life should be discussed by patient, family, and doctors. Nutrition SupportThe goals of nutrition support for patients in the last days of life are different from the goals during cancer treatment.Making plans for  nutrition support in the last days is helpful.Two types of nutrition support are commonly used. AntibioticsThe benefits of using antibiotics in the last days of life are  unclear. TransfusionsThe decision to use blood transfusions in advanced cancer depends on goals of care and other factors. ResuscitationPeople should decide whether or not they want cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The goals of giving fluids at the end of life should be discussed by patient, family, and doctors. The goals of nutrition support for patients in the last days of life are different from the goals during cancer treatment. Making plans for  nutrition support in the last days is helpful. Two types of nutrition support are commonly used. The benefits of using antibiotics in the last days of life are  unclear. The decision to use blood transfusions in advanced cancer depends on goals of care and other factors. People should decide whether or not they want cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Decisions about whether to use life-sustaining treatments that may extend life in the final weeks or days cause a great deal of confusion and  anxiety. Some of these treatments are ventilator use, parenteral nutrition, and dialysis. People near death may be guided by their oncologist, but they have the right to make their own choices about     life-sustaining treatments.   The following are some of the questions to discuss: What are the person’s goals of care? How would the possible benefits of  life-sustaining treatments help reach the person's goals of care, and how likely is the desired outcome? How would  the possible harms of life-sustaining treatments affect the person's goals of care? Is the possible benefit worth the possible harm? Besides possible benefits and harms of life-sustaining treatments, what else can affect the decision? Are there other resources, such as palliative care, a  chaplain, or a medical ethicist, that could help the person or family make decisions about life-sustaining treatments? A person may wish to receive all possible treatments, only some treatments, or no treatment at all in the last days of life.         These decisions may be written down ahead of time in an advance directive, such as a living will. Advance directive is the general term for different types of legal documents that describe the treatment or care a patient wishes to receive or not receive when he or she is no longer able to speak their wishes. Studies have shown that people with cancer who have end-of-life discussions with their doctors choose to have fewer procedures, such as resuscitation or the use of a ventilator. They are also less likely to be in intensive care, and the cost of their healthcare is lower during their final week of life. Reports from their caregivers show that these people live just as long as those who choose to have more procedures, and have a better quality of life in their last days. For more information, see Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care in Advanced Cancer. A spiritual assessment is a method or tool used by doctors to understand  the role that religious and spiritual beliefs have in the person's life. This may help the doctor understand how these beliefs affect the way the person copes with cancer  and makes decisions about cancer treatment. Serious illnesses like cancer may cause people or family caregivers to have doubts about their beliefs or religious values and cause spiritual distress.  Some studies show that people with cancer may feel anger at God or may have a loss of faith after being diagnosed. Other people may have feelings of spiritual distress when coping with cancer.   Spiritual distress may affect end-of-life decisions and increase depression. Doctors and nurses, together with social workers and psychologists,  may be able to offer care that supports a person's spiritual health. They may encourage the person to meet with their spiritual or religious leaders or join  a spiritual support group. This may improve a person's quality of life and ability to cope. When people with advanced cancer receive spiritual support from the medical team, they are  more likely to choose hospice care and less aggressive treatment at the end of life. For more information, see Spirituality in Cancer Care. Fluids may be given when the person can no longer eat or drink  normally. Fluids may be given  with  an intravenous (IV) catheter or through a needle under the skin. Decisions about giving fluids should be based on the person's goals of care. Giving fluids   has not been shown to help patients live longer or improve their quality of life. However, the harms are minor and the family may feel there are benefits if the person is  less fatigued and more alert. The family may also be able to give the person sips of water or ice chips or swab the mouth and lips to keep them moist. Nutrition support can improve health and boost healing during cancer treatment.  The goals of nutrition therapy for people  during the last days of life are different from the goals for people in active cancer treatment and recovery. In the final days of life, people often lose the desire to eat or drink and may not want food or fluids that are offered to them. Also, procedures used to put in feeding tubes may be hard on them. The goal of end-of-life care is to prevent suffering and relieve symptoms. If nutrition support  causes the person more discomfort than help, then nutrition support near the end of life may be stopped. The needs and best interests of each person guide the decision to give nutrition support. When decisions and plans about nutrition support are made by the person near death, doctors and family members can be sure they are doing what the person wants. If the person cannot swallow, two types of nutrition support are commonly used: Enteral nutrition uses a tube inserted into the stomach or intestine. Parenteral nutrition uses an intravenous (IV) catheter inserted into a vein. Each type of nutrition support has benefits and risks.  
 For more information, see Nutrition in Cancer Care. The use of  antibiotics and other treatments for infection is common in people in the last days of life, but it is hard to tell how well they work. It is also hard to tell if there are any benefits of using antibiotics at the end of life. Overall, doctors want to make the person comfortable in the last days of life rather than  give treatments that may not help them live longer. Many people with advanced cancer have anemia. People with advanced blood cancers may have thrombocytopenia (a condition in which there is a lower-than-normal number of platelets in the blood). Deciding whether to  use blood transfusions for these conditions is based on the following: goals of care how long the person is expected to live the   benefits and risks of the transfusion The decision can be hard to make because people usually need to receive transfusions in a medical setting rather than at home. Many people with cancer are used to receiving  blood transfusions during active treatment or  supportive care and may want to  continue transfusions to feel better. However, studies have not shown that transfusions are safe and effective at the end of life. An important decision for a person near death to make is whether to have cardiopulmonary resuscitation    (CPR) (trying to restart the heart and breathing when it stops). It is best if people   talk with  their family, doctors, and caregivers about their wishes for CPR as early as possible (for example, when being admitted to the hospital or when active cancer treatment is stopped). A do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order is written by a doctor to tell other health professionals not to perform CPR at the moment of death, so that the natural process of dying occurs. If the person wishes, he or she can ask the doctor to write a DNR order. The person can ask that the DNR order be changed or removed at any time. Choices about whether to use intensive care should be discussed. Ventilator use may keep a person alive after normal breathing stops.Before a ventilator is turned off, family members will be given information about what to expect. Before a ventilator is turned off, family members will be given information about what to expect. Near the end of life, people with advanced cancer may be admitted to a hospital or   intensive care unit (ICU) if they have not made other choices for their care. In the ICU, patients or family members have to make hard decisions about whether to start, continue, or stop aggressive treatments that may make the person live longer but harm their quality of life. Families may be unsure of their feelings or have trouble deciding whether to limit or avoid  treatments. Sometimes, treatments like dialysis or blood transfusions may be tried for a short time. However, at any time, patients or families may talk with doctors about  whether they want to continue with ICU care. They may  choose instead to change over  to  comfort care in the final days. A ventilator is a machine that helps people breathe. Sometimes, using a ventilator will not improve the person's condition but will keep them alive longer. If the goal of care is to help the person live longer, a ventilator may be used, according to  the person's wishes. If ventilator support stops  helping or is no longer what the person wants, the person, their family, and the healthcare team may decide to turn the ventilator off. Family members will be given information about how the person may respond when the ventilator is removed and about pain relief or sedation to keep the person comfortable. Family members will be given time to contact other  loved ones who wish to be there. Chaplains or social workers may be called to support to the family. The emotions of patients and caregivers are closely connected. Palliative sedation lowers the level of consciousness and relieves extreme pain and suffering. Patients and caregivers share the distress of cancer,  with the caregiver's distress sometimes being greater than the patient's distress. Since caregiver suffering can affect the person's well-being and the caregiver's adjustment to loss, early and constant support of the caregiver is very important. Palliative sedation uses drugs called sedatives to relieve extreme suffering by making a person calm and unaware. The decision whether to sedate a person at the end of life   is a hard one. Sedation may be  considered for a person's comfort or for a physical condition such as uncontrolled pain. Palliative sedation may be given on and off, or until death. A person's thoughts and feelings  about end-of-life sedation may depend greatly on his or her own culture and beliefs.
Some people who become anxious facing the end of life may want to be sedated. Some people and their families may wish to have a level of sedation that allows them to communicate with each other. Other people may wish to have no procedures, including sedation, just before death. Studies have not shown that palliative sedation shortens life when used in the last days. It is important for the person to tell family members and healthcare providers of their wishes about   sedation at the end of life. When a person makes their wishes about sedation known ahead of time, doctors and family members can be sure they are doing what the person would want. Families may need  support from the healthcare team and mental health counselors while palliative sedation is used. Grief is a normal reaction to the loss of a loved one. People who feel unable to cope with their loss may be helped by grief counseling or grief therapy with trained professionals. For more information, see Grief, Bereavement, and Coping With Loss.

T!tle : Treating precancerous anal growths cuts risk of anal cancer - NCI

d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  In people with HIV, treating precancerous anal lesions cuts risk of anal cancer by more than half   News Releases   Posted:
June 15, 2022  240-760-6600 A cartoon from the ANCHOR study website, anchorstudy.org A large clinical trial of people living with HIV has found that treating anal precancerous growths known as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, or HSIL, reduces the chance that anal cancer will develop by more than half. Results from the Anal Cancer/HSIL Outcomes Research (ANCHOR) study were published June 16 in the New England Journal of Medicine. The trial was funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health. “We've now shown for the first time that treating anal HSIL is effective at reducing the incidence of anal cancer in a very high-risk group of people — people living with HIV,” said Joel Palefsky, M.D., of the University of California, San Francisco, who led the study. “By showing that treatment for HSIL reduces the risk of anal cancer, this study also provides a rationale for screening for anal HSIL in people with HIV,” said Robert Yarchoan, M.D., director of NCI’s Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy. The trial was conducted through the NCI-supported AIDS Malignancy Consortium. Although anal cancer is relatively rare in the general population, it is the fourth most common cancer among people living with HIV. The incidence of anal cancer is estimated to be 89 per 100,000 among men living with HIV who have sex with men and between 18.6 and 35.6 per 100,000 among women living with HIV. In comparison, the incidence of anal cancer in the general population is 1.6 per 100,000. Nearly all cases of anal cancer are caused by infection of anal cells with cancer-causing types of human papillomavirus (HPV). If the immune system does not fight off the infection, the lingering infection can cause the cells to become progressively more abnormal, ultimately developing into HSIL and then, in some cases, into anal cancer. This progression is similar to what is seen in cervical cancer, which is also caused by HPV. Although HPV vaccination can prevent new anal HPV infections, no evidence-based recommendations are currently available to guide screening for and treatment of anal HSIL. Routine screening for cervical cancer with HPV and/or Pap testing and removing cervical HSIL has been shown to prevent many cases of cervical cancer. However, it has been unclear whether the treatment of anal HSIL found through screening similarly prevents anal cancer. Moreover, the treatment of anal HSIL is more challenging than the treatment of cervical HSIL, and recurrences are common. The ANCHOR study is the first randomized controlled trial to determine whether treating anal HSIL is a safe and effective strategy for reducing the progression of HSIL to anal cancer. In the phase 3 trial, which was carried out at 25 sites nationwide, 10,723 people age 35 or older living with HIV underwent screening for HSIL with high-resolution anoscopy, a procedure to examine the inner lining of the anus and rectum. Of these, 4,459 people were diagnosed with HSIL. People in this group were then randomly assigned to receive treatment or to receive active monitoring with no treatment, the current standard of care. Most people in the treatment group received office-based electrocautery, a procedure in which heat from an electric current is used to destroy abnormal tissue. After a median follow-up of just over two years, 21 people in the active monitoring group were diagnosed with anal cancer, compared with nine people in the treatment group — a 57% reduction. The majority of the side effects in the treatment group were mild and included pain and bleeding. “The data support treating anal HSIL as the standard of care for people living with HIV who are 35 years of age or older,” said Dr. Palefsky.  He noted that the findings could also potentially lead to recommendations for screening for HSIL in people living with HIV and might also change the standard of care for other groups at lower but still increased risk of anal cancer, including HIV-negative men who have sex with men, women who have had other HPV-related precancers or cancers, and people who are immunosuppressed after organ transplantation or other reasons. The authors noted that the clinicians participating in the study were well trained in high-resolution anoscopy and in treating HSIL. “Our results may not be replicated if high-resolution anoscopy and treatment are performed by clinicians with less training and clinical support,” the researchers wrote. Dr. Palefsky said the findings highlight the need for additional training of clinicians, as well as more research on effective approaches for screening and treating HSIL. “Although we did show a statistically significant reduction in anal cancer due to treatment, we did not prevent all the cases of cancer,” Dr. Palefsky noted. “What that points to is a need for ongoing follow-up of everybody who has developed anal HSIL, even if they've been treated, as well as for improvements in the treatments that we use.” As for next steps in the study, Dr. Palefsky said they have developed a biorepository of tissue samples from the study participants. These samples will be analyzed to help identify possible biomarkers for who should be screened for HSIL and to investigate the biology behind how HSIL progresses to anal cancer. “This study will give an absolute wealth of information about anal cancer,” Dr. Yarchoan said.

Research Articles   Research Articles  Summary In an international randomized phase III clinical trial, the hormone therapy enzalutamide (Xtandi®) extended survival in men with metastatic prostate cancer that had progressed during treatment with androgen deprivation therapy. Participants in the trial had not received chemotherapy. Source New England Journal of Medicine, June 1, 2014. (See the journal article.) Background Early in their development, prostate cancers need relatively high levels of male sex hormones (androgens) to grow. The testes are the main source of androgens, and treatments that stop the testes from producing male sex hormones—known as hormone therapy or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)—are therefore a common treatment for androgen-sensitive prostate cancer. However, most prostate cancers eventually become castrate resistant—that is, they can grow even when androgen levels in the blood are very low. ADT does not block production of the small amount of androgen that is made by the adrenal glands and by prostate cancer cells themselves, and this low level is sufficient to fuel the growth of castrate-resistant prostate cancers. Enzalutamide is among several hormone therapies that have been developed to prevent the androgen-fueled growth of castrate-resistant prostate cancers. This drug works by keeping androgens from binding to the androgen receptors on prostate cancer cells. Treatments for castrate-resistant prostate cancer include chemotherapy with docetaxel (Taxotere®). Enzalutamide is approved by the FDA for the treatment of men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer that is no longer responding to chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy is not a treatment option for many men with pre-existing medical conditions or who cannot tolerate the side effects. The Study The randomized, double-blind PREVAIL trial enrolled 1,717 men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who had few or no symptoms and had not received chemotherapy. The trial included patients from North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Men in the trial were randomly assigned to receive 160 mg of enzalutamide or a placebo taken orally once daily. The primary endpoints of the trial were overall survival (the time from random assignment to death from any cause) and radiographic progression-free survival (the time from random assignment to death or to the first evidence from imaging analysis, which was done regularly, that disease was progressing). Secondary endpoints included time to initiation of chemotherapy and time to the first skeletal-related event (such as bone fracture, spinal cord compression, or the need for radiation to treat bone-related symptoms). In October 2013, on the basis of an interim analysis that showed a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death for men taking enzalutamide, an independent data safety and monitoring committee recommended stopping the trial early and allowing men who were assigned to the placebo group to begin taking enzalutamide. Tomasz Beer, M.D., of the Oregon Health & Science University, led the trial. Medivation and Astellas Pharma, the companies that manufacture and market enzalutamide, funded the study. Results At 12 months of follow-up, the rate of radiographic progression-free survival was 65 percent among men who took enzalutamide, compared with just 14 percent among men who took placebo. Not enough men in the trial’s enzalutamide group had experienced radiographic disease progression to establish a median radiographic progression-free survival; median radiographic progression-free survival in the placebo group was 3.9 months. At the interim analysis (after a median follow-up of approximately 22 months), 28 percent of men in the enzalutamide group had died, compared with 35 percent of men in the placebo group. Men who received enzalutamide experienced a 29 percent reduction in the risk of death compared with those who received placebo. The improvements in radiographic progression-free and overall survival with enzalutamide were seen in all subgroups of patients, including those with visceral disease, who have been excluded from other trials involving men with metastatic prostate cancer who have not received previous chemotherapy because of their poorer prognosis. Enzalutamide showed a benefit with regard to all of the trial’s prespecified secondary endpoints, the authors reported, including an approximately 17 month improvement in the median time to initiation of chemotherapy and a reduced risk of a first skeletal-related event. Many patients in both groups received additional therapies after their disease began to progress—40 percent of those in the enzalutamide group and 70 percent of those in the placebo group. The most common additional therapies were docetaxel and abiraterone (Zytiga®). (Abiraterone, another hormone therapy, prevents the production of testosterone by the adrenal glands and prostate cancer cells, as well as by the testes.) The most common side effects among participants taking enzalutamide were fatigue, constipation, and back and joint pain. Hypertension was the most common serious (grade 3 or higher) side effect in the enzalutamide arm. Enzalutamide delayed deterioration in the quality of life of trial participants compared with placebo, as measured by a questionnaire that assesses patient-reported health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer. Limitations Assessing the impact of enzalutamide on overall survival is complicated by the fact that many patients in the trial went on to receive treatments that have been proven to improve survival after their disease worsened, explained Bhupinder Mann, M.B.B.S., of NCI’s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. In the future, Dr. Mann noted, the population of patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer who have not received docetaxel is likely to become smaller. That's because a large NCI-sponsored clinical trial recently showed that, in men with prostate cancer that is still androgen sensitive, treatment with docetaxel at the beginning of ADT substantially improves overall survival. The survival improvement in that trial was primarily seen in patients with more extensive metastatic disease. "More patients will probably get docetaxel early on," he said, "so the PREVAIL trial results won't directly apply to them." Comment In men with metastatic prostate cancer, chemotherapy can improve overall and progression-free survival, the authors wrote. However, they continued, "many patients do not receive such therapy primarily because of pre-existing medical conditions or associated toxic effects. Thus, there is a need for effective, convenient, and less toxic therapies." Dr. Mann agreed that enzalutamide would "provide another option for men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer prior to receiving chemotherapy" if the FDA were to approve it for this indication. The finding that enzalutamide delayed deterioration in participant-rated quality of life suggests that "the treatment effects translated into patient-perceived benefits," the authors wrote.  Posted:

Past Events  About DCB  Progress   Past Events  The 2023 NCI Junior Investigator (JI) Meeting was held at the University of Pennsylvania on August 17-18, 2023. This hybrid (in person & virtual) meeting brought together junior investigators (defined as late stage graduate students, postdocs, and early career faculty) representing experimental and systems biologists, physical scientists, big data scientists, engineers, and computational modelers who build and apply novel tools to better understand cancer. The JI meeting provided opportunities for junior scientists to meet fellow researchers, showcase their work, foster collaborations, and generate synergy between individuals with diverse skills and shared research interests. Sessions during the meeting included a keynote lecture, panel discussions, workshops, and presentations by trainees and early-stage researchers. The meeting was a collaborative effort of NCI program groups: Big Data Scientist Training Enhancement Program (BD-STEP)  Cellular Cancer Biology Imaging Research (CCBIR)  Cancer Systems Biology Consortium (CSBC)  Cancer Tissue Engineering Collaborative (TEC)  Innovative Molecular Analysis Technologies (IMAT)  Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR)  Metastasis Research Network (MetNet)  Patient-Derived Models of Cancer (PDMC)  Physical Sciences-Oncology Network (PS-ON)  Synthetic Biology and Cancer Program (SynBio & Cancer)   Documents from the Meeting  Presentation Award Winners at the Meeting  Social Media Related to the Meeting  DCB Contacts for the Meeting  Documents from the Meeting Presentation Award Winners at the Meeting Social Media Related to the Meeting DCB Contacts for the Meeting Documents from the Meeting Agenda  Program Book  Presentation Award Winners at the Meeting Podium Presentation Awards Lindsey Fernandez, Ph.D. (University of Pennsylvania): Clinical combination therapy optimization through personalized mechanistic models  Yiling Liu (University of New South Wales): Biomimetic polymeric hydrogels at physiological stiffness reprogram melanoma cells  Sukrit Singh, Ph.D. (MSKCC): Biophysical parsing of cancer drug resistance using exascale supercomputing  Mohita Tagore, Ph.D. (MSKCC): GABAergic signaling driven regulation of the melanoma microenvironment  Poster Presentation Awards Wisam Fares (University of Virginia): TGF-beta ligand processing and signaling are rewired by TGFBR3 coreceptor  Jane Miglo (University of Illinois Chicago): Effects of ovulatory secretions on pre-neoplastic lesions using microfluidic PREDICT platform  Daniel (Zongjie) Wang, Ph.D. (Northwestern University): Targeting tumor-reactive immune cells from peripheral blood for accessible cancer immunotherapy  Poster Presentations – Honorable Mentions Emma Drabbe (University of Miami): Novel tissue bioreactor for retinal organoid microenvironmnental control  Laura Hueser (Johns Hopkins University): Aged fibroblast-derived extracellular vesicles promote melanoma progression in vitro and in vivo  Mouhita Humayun, Ph.D. (MIT): Investigating the role of Rho GTPases on the ability of tumor cells to extravasate during metastasis using a human microphysiological model  Taylor Marohl (University of Virginia): Assessing the effects of a novel mutation in proprotein convertase PCSK5 on the MCF10DCIS model of breast ductal carcinoma in sit  Sneha Mitra, Ph.D. (MSKCC): Role of regulatory T cells in colorectal cancer  Nina Steele, Ph.D. (Henry Ford Health): Therapeutic modulation of Robo4 in pancreatic cancer  Social Media Related to the Meeting Social media posts related to the NCI Junior Investigator Meeting can be found using #NCIJI2023.

T!tle : NIH, PCF launch study on prostate cancer in black men - NCI
ur$ : https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2018/respond-prostate-black-men
d@t@ :  About Cancer  Cancer Types  Research  Grants & Training  News & Events  About NCI   Home  News & Events  News Releases  2018  NIH and Prostate Cancer Foundation launch large study on aggressive prostate cancer in African-American men   News Releases   Posted:
July 17, 2018  240-760-6600 The largest coordinated research effort to study biological and non-biological factors associated with aggressive prostate cancer in African-American men has begun. The $26.5 million study is called RESPOND, or Research on Prostate Cancer in Men of African Ancestry: Defining the Roles of Genetics, Tumor Markers, and Social Stress. It will investigate environmental and genetic factors related to aggressiveness of prostate cancer in African-American men to better understand why they disproportionally experience aggressive disease—that is, disease that grows and spreads quickly—compared with men of other racial and ethnic groups. RESPOND is supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), both parts of the National Institutes of Health, as well as by the Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF). The NCI funding will be provided from the 21st Century Cures Cancer Moonshot Initiative. “Understanding why African-American men are more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer than men of other racial and ethnic groups is a critical, unanswered question in cancer disparities research,” said NCI Director Ned Sharpless, M.D. “This large, collaborative study can help the cancer research community better understand and address these disparities.” African-American men have about a 15 percent chance of developing prostate cancer in their lifetimes, compared to about a 10 percent chance for white men, and African-American men are more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive disease. In addition, the risk of dying from prostate cancer for African-American men is about 4 percent compared to about 2 percent for white men. With the RESPOND study, researchers aim to learn more about why these disparities exist. “This study, which is combining state-of-the-art molecular approaches with social and environmental science, will help unravel the complex interactions of biological, behavioral, and environmental factors that contribute to excess prostate cancer burden and poorer outcomes in African-American men, allowing development of tailored approaches for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in this population,” said NIMHD Director Eliseo Pérez-Stable, M.D. The investigators aim to enroll 10,000 African-American men with prostate cancer into the RESPOND study. The participants will be identified primarily via NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Program of Cancer Registries. In addition, this study builds on years of research collaboration involving investigators who are part of the African Ancestry Prostate Cancer (AAPC) consortium. These investigators will contribute additional information and samples from 10,000 African-American men with prostate cancer. In accordance with NIH data sharing policies, and with appropriate informed consent, the de-identified data and samples collected as part of this research will be made available as a resource to the scientific community, aiding future research. Investigators in the study will examine possible associations between aggressive disease and exposures to neighborhood/environmental stressors such as discrimination, early-life adversity, and segregation. They will also study DNA and tumor samples to identify gene variants associated with aggressive prostate cancer. Once researchers have identified genetic changes associated with aggressive prostate cancer, they will investigate how the social environment interacts with those genetic changes. “Previous research on prostate cancer disparities has investigated social and genetic factors separately, but we know these components interact with each other to contribute to disparities,” said Damali Martin, Ph.D., program director for the study in NCI’s Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program. “The ability to integrate genetic and environmental factors, including individual, neighborhood, and societal factors, into one large study will enable us to have a better understanding of how all of these factors contribute to the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.” RESPOND, a cooperative agreement, will be led by Christopher Haiman, Sc.D., of the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, in collaboration with John Carpten, Ph.D., Ann Hamilton, Ph.D., and David Conti, Ph.D., also of USC; Scarlett Gomez, Ph.D., of the University of California, San Francisco; Tamara Lotan, M.D., of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore; and Franklin Huang, M.D., Ph.D., of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. NCI’s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics will perform genotyping, and the Center for Inherited Disease Research at Johns Hopkins University will conduct DNA sequencing for the genetic component of the study. NCI’s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences is administering the study grant. “No group in the world is hit harder by prostate cancer than men of African descent, and, to date, little is known about the biological reasons for these disparities, or the full impact of environmental factors,” said Jonathan W. Simons, M.D., PCF’s president and CEO. “We celebrate our partnership and applaud NIH for spearheading this study, which we believe will help pave the way for groundbreaking discoveries that will improve health equity for African-American men and their families.” About the National Cancer Institute (NCI): NCI leads the National Cancer Program and NIH’s efforts to dramatically reduce the prevalence of cancer and improve the lives of cancer patients and their families, through research into prevention and cancer biology, the development of new interventions, and the training and mentoring of new researchers.

Duncan. The National Cancer Institute designated the Duncan Cancer Center the following year in 2007. In 2015, the Duncan Cancer Center received comprehensive status from NCI for the breadth and depth of its research and its commitment to serve all Houstonians, making the Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center one of only three comprehensive cancer centers in Texas. The Duncan Cancer Center has had marked increases in cancer research funding, from $99 million in 2007 to more than $170 million today. In addition, the center is a proud leader in community outreach, education, and reduction of health disparities in Texas. The Duncan Cancer Center provides compassionate patient care and cutting-edge research through four hospital partners: Baylor St. Luke’s Medical Center, the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Harris Health System’s Ben Taub Hospital, and Texas Children’s Hospital. Its mission is to reduce morbidity and mortality from cancer through research, education, and outreach into the community.  The Duncan Cancer Center is a world leader in the genomics and proteomics of cancer and pioneered the science that led to optimal hormonal therapies and other targeted therapies, as well as the immunotherapeutic treatment of cancer using CAR T cells. Investigators explore the interactions between the environment and genetics that lead to cancer, and through this science, they identify new targets for the development of novel drugs and biomarkers. The Duncan Cancer Center has enrolled more than 5,400 patients into clinical trials since 2007. Investigators are saving lives and improving care through innovative studies in adoptive T-cell immunotherapy, precision medicine, and de-escalation of treatment of breast and other cancers. Research programs include:  Breast Cancer; Cell and Gene Therapy; Pediatric Cancer; Nuclear Receptor; Transcription and Chromatin Biology; Mechanisms in Cancer Evolution; Cell Signaling and Metabolism; and Cancer Prevention and Population Sciences. The center is home to three Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs) grants from NCI in breast cancer, lymphoma, and a shared SPORE with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center on glioma.   In a collaborative pilot with the Cancer Prevention and Population Sciences Program, the Mechanisms in Cancer Evolution Program, the Center for Precision Environmental Health, and the Oregon Health and Science University, the Duncan Cancer Center responded within a few days of the Hurricane Harvey catastrophe to provide funding to purchase silicone wrist bands to be worn by flood victims. The wristbands passively measured exposures to the 1,500 toxic chemicals, carcinogens, and endocrine disruptors that could have immediate and long-term effects on health, including cancer.  The center is also focused on initiatives that will likely alter medical practice. One project resulted from a collaboration in the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy program between basic scientists and clinicians. Patients posttransplant are at high risk for several potentially lethal viral infections. This group employed multivirus-specific T cells posttransplant and achieved a 92% response rate. In another project with implications for clinical treatment, the Breast Cancer Program showed that many patients with human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)–positive breast cancer may not need chemotherapy but can be treated with targeted therapy alone. Biomarkers to select the best patients for this strategy are now under development.  *The profile was provided by Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center. *The profile was provided by Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Past Programs  Funding  Researcher Resources  News & Events  About DCB  Progress   Past Programs  Stacey Finley, Ph.D., a CSBC Investigator at the University of Southern California (USC), is working to identify new drug targets for cancer by studying the disease as a system of biochemical reactions. She trained in chemical engineering, since she was excited by the application of math, physics, and chemistry to solve problems. As an undergraduate, she applied her knowledge to manufacturing processes at Procter & Gamble through three summer internships. She worked to optimize refining processes for a product additive, maximize the efficiency of bar soap production, and designed experiments to understand which factors in a system contribute to the physical characteristics of dry laundry detergent particles. Now, Dr. Finley uses engineering tools to answer biological questions about human health. In this interview, she shares career advice from her mentors, describes her views on computational systems biology, and discusses her research developing a multiscale model of colorectal cancer. I think one of the biggest things is to be resilient. You need to have resolve that your ideas are worth being pursued. Even when grant or paper reviewers critique your work, you need to persist in answering research questions that are interesting and exciting to you. My mentors also helped me see that a diversity of perspectives is important in research, especially the study of cancer. We need to embrace the diversity of perspectives that comes from bringing together people with different personal, scientific, and educational backgrounds. In general, systems biology is trying to understand individual processes within the context of the larger system. For example, in a signaling network, you can look at a single molecular species or individual reaction of the network. However, looking at a species or reaction in isolation doesn’t help us understand the complexity of the larger network. Computational systems biology seeks to build systems-level mathematical models by taking advantage of experimental approaches that are generating high resolution, quantitative data integrated with computational approaches. An important skill from the computational side of cancer systems biology is being able to interact and communicate with other researchers. My lab is using data from experimental researchers to build predictive models, so we need to understand and talk with them about the data. We need to know how to use their experimental measurements to build our models. We need to know what they are saying and what the data means. Also, my lab needs to be able to communicate model predictions that are understandable to experimental researchers and clinicians. Communication is really important for cancer systems biology research. There are three investigators, including myself, working on this CSBC project. We all have complementary expertise to build an experimentally validated multiscale model. My contribution is looking inside the cell at metabolic reactions that allow the cell to take up nutrients from the environment. Cells in the tumor and tumor stroma can process these nutrients to produce the building blocks that tumors need for growth. My lab is building a model of intracellular metabolism and predicting the concentrations of molecular species inside the cell. Paul Macklin is using a computational framework to look at the level of the cell. He’s predicting the dynamics of the cells themselves using a cell model. Additionally, Paul and I can embed the intracellular model inside the cell framework to predict cellular behavior, as well as can examine multiple types of cells within a tumor at the tissue scale. Using a model of this level, we can study how cells interact with each other and drive the growth of the tumor. Based on the model with these different scales, we can ask, “If we change one or more metabolic reactions in a tumor or stromal cell, how will that change the growth of the tumor overall?” We can also observe that the tumor is growing in such a way, and ask, “Can we identify the main reactions that are contributing to that growth?” We are really trying to build a mathematical model that provides a framework to test predictions at targeting metabolic reactions that would influence tumor growth. Shannon Mumenthaler will use organoids to test and validate the predictions that we make with the mathematical model. The organoids are derived using patient samples, which puts us one step closer to ensure that our predictions are clinically relevant.

Mentoring  Funding for Cancer Training  Building a Diverse Workforce  About Center for Cancer Training (CCT)  Inside Cancer Careers Podcast  CCT Staff & Contact   New to NCI  Get Involved  Courses & Fellowships  Career Planning  Mentoring  There are many groups for fellows that you can join to help foster a sense of community here at NIH. The groups range from special interest groups to opportunities to gain leadership or helping to advocate for fellows on campus. Many of these groups are hosted by either the National Cancer Institute (NCI) or the Office of Intramural Training and Education (OITE). These groups are hosted specifically by the National Cancer Institute, and can serve as opportunities to gain leadership and management experiences, as well as extend your network. Black Cancer Researchers (BCR) is a fellow-led group established to build community and create a safe space for Black scientists within the NCI.  The group will help participants build collaboration (both scientific and professional), provide peer mentoring, and grow their scientific network.  The group meets on the third Wednesday of each month at 4:00 PM.   To join our listserv and become a part of our community, click here.   For questions, please contact Dr. Dominiqua Griffin. The Cancer Community Partnership (CCP) is a collaboration between individuals affected by cancer, patient advocates, researchers, and health care providers. CCP’s goal is to learn from one another through inclusive conversations and to influence the development of cancer science and cancer care by integrating the patient experience at all levels. Subscribe to the CCP listserv to receive updates and invitations to events or contact us at cancercommunity@nih.gov. CCR-FYI enhances the intramural training program, fosters communication among NCI fellows and the CCR research community, and serves as a liaison to CCR senior management on programs affecting the training experience. All NCI fellows are invited to join the CCR-FYI Association and participate in the CCR-FYI Steering Committee meetings, which take place on the last (non-holiday) Thursday of the month through Microsoft Teams meeting. The FDC is composed of a diverse group of fellows at NCI-Frederick whose vision is to foster scientific excellence and to empower tomorrow’s leaders.  All fellows on the NCI Frederick campus can join for mentorship, networking, and career development activities. The NIH/NCI Fellows Editorial Board offers fellows a free, confidential scientific document-editing service and gives fellows who join the Board editorial training and experience. Membership in the Editorial Board is open to all NIH or FDA fellows and other professionals upon approval of their supervisors and consultation with the senior editor of the Editorial Board. Previous editorial experience is not required. The NCI Education and Outreach Program connects scientists with schools in the communities surrounding the NCI campuses.  This program aims to enhance our next generation of scientist's STEM experiences from elementary school through high school, while empowering teachers to provide high-quality science education. The Trainee Technology Advisory Group (TTAG) was developed to improve and address key issues in the tools and resources available in the current NCI training environment. TTAG's goal is to define the scope and features we should prioritize and ensure that we develop technologies and resources that will be useful to all trainees.  TTAG will meet with CCT leadership and our development team several times a year for updates and feedback and may be called upon to participate in workshops, alpha tests, and similar engagements. If interested, please contact NCICCTTTAG@mail.nih.gov. NCI Global Health Interest Group, established in October 2021, is a fellow-led NCI interest group aimed at facilitating learning and networking among fellows interested in global cancer research and control with a particular emphasis on work in Low-Middle Income Countries (LMICs). Promote collaboration and knowledge-sharing between fellows, across NCI divisions, engaged or interested in issues of global cancer research and control  Organize and facilitate trans-disciplinary global oncology seminars, trainings, and networking opportunities with experts in the field  Support professional development in topics such as scientific communication, cultural competencies, leadership, and career planning  Collaborate with NCI-CGH to provide guidance and input on CGH-led research, trainings, and partnership activities for fellows  Open to fellows (summer, postbaccalaureate, predoctoral, postdoctoral, and clinical), across NCI,  with interests in global cancer research and control with an emphasis on work in LMICs. To join the NCI Global Health Interest and/or to be added to the Listserv, please email NCIGHIG@NIH.GOV. There are many fellows’ groups both within the NCI and NIH-wide that you can join during your time here. These groups have many leadership positions available and numerous committees on which you can participate. FelCom is comprised of a basic and a clinical fellow representative from each institute of NIH and serves the NIH fellows community through the actions of eight subcommittees and fifteen committee liaisons. The committee discusses areas of concern, the progress of current projects, and receives reports from representatives serving as liaisons. Meetings are open to all NIH fellows and are scheduled for the first Thursday of every month in Building 1: Wilson Hall (3rd Floor). The Graduate Student Council (GSC) was created with three specific goals: 1) Address and represent the intellectual, social, and living needs of the community of graduate students at the NIH, 2) Foster the development of an interactive and stimulating student environment at NIH by creating a forum for needs to be discussed with the student body, and 3) Serve as a communication pathway by which students as a group may interact with the rest of the NIH community. The GSC coordinates and sponsors events to enhance the training experience of the NIH graduate students. GSC meetings are held the last non-holiday Tuesday of each month at 5pm in Bldg 10 Rm 1N263 (grad student lounge). All grad students are welcome to visit the meeting to learn about what the Council is doing and to offer ideas and suggestions. The NIH Science Policy Discussion Group (SPDG) was established in 2009 as a fellow-led and run self-governing organization to bring together fellows with a shared passion for understanding the intersection of scientific research and legislative policy. The purpose of the SPDG is to enhance our knowledge and understanding of science policy and contribute to the public discourse on specific issues of current relevance and public interest. Space in the group is limited. Members are selected in late August or early September of each year based on a short written statement of intent. Network of African-American Fellows at the NIH (NAAF)  NIH - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered - Fellows and Friends (LGBT-FF)  The NIH-SACNAS (Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science)  Orthodox Jewish Mincha Minyon Notice  The Women of Color Research Network  NIH Black Scientists and Friends Network  Mom-Dad-Docs  Bethesda Campus Christian Fellowship  NIH American Muslim Professional (NIH-AMP) Group  The NIH Visiting Fellows Committee (NIHVFC) is composed of NIH post-doctoral visiting fellows (VFs) from all around the world. It is a self-governing body serving the interest of visiting fellows in their transition to life at the NIH, by working to make their experience here worthwhile; as well as creating the opportunities for visiting fellows to maintain continuity in their research upon returning to their home countries. NIHVFC also plans to encourage the establishment and maintenance of strong institutional links of VFs with NIH after they complete their training and go back to their home countries.  Updated:

To stay up to date on Funding for Cancer Training news, subscribe to the Cancer Training Branch Newsletter! The NCI only uses the parent K01 funding opportunities to support the early career-stage researchers in cancer control and population sciences and cancer prevention. Candidates must have completed at least two, but usually not more than five years of research training/experience beyond a doctoral degree at the time of submitting a K01 application. Early career-stage faculty, including assistant professors (or equivalent), may apply if within the eligibility window. Exceptions will be considered by the program contacts on a case-by-case basis. NCI accepts K01 applications from eligible individuals in only the following two subject areas, cancer control and population sciences and cancer prevention, as defined below. Applications on other research topics will be withdrawn without review. Research Areas of Interest: NCI will only accept K01 applications that are submitted in response to one of the following Notices: NOT-CA-24-022: Notice of Special Interest: National Cancer Institute Supports Applications for the Mentored Research Scientist Development Awards (K01) Within the Mission of the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences.  NOT-CA-24-023: Notice of Special Interest: National Cancer Institute Supports Applications for the Mentored Research Scientist Development Awards (K01) Within the Mission of the Division of Cancer Prevention.  Applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss their proposal with the NCI scientific program contact before preparing an application. Cancer Control science is defined as basic and applied research in the behavioral, social, and population sciences to create or enhance interventions that, independently or in combination with biomedical approaches reduce cancer risk, incidence, morbidity, and mortality, and improve quality of life. Several broad areas of interest include: development and validation of methods, technologies, and tools in surveillance, statistics, epidemiology, health care delivery, and the behavioral sciences; identification of modifiable risk factors or host susceptibility factors associated with cancer etiology, cancer prevention, behaviors, health communication, and treatment outcomes; and clinical and translational science to reduce risk, incidence, and death from cancer, as well as enhance the quality of life for cancer survivors. Other areas of interest include cross-cutting themes, health disparities and health equity, implementation science, and cancer survivorship. More information about potentially relevant research areas can be found by examining the mission and scientific scope of the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences. For application acceptance in the subject area of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, applicants must include “NOT-CA-24-022” (without quotation marks) in the Agency Routing Identifier field (box 4B) of the SF424 R&R form. NCI K01 applications without this information in box 4B will not be accepted and withdrawn. The focus of this research area is early translational research aimed at advancing the application of the mechanistic and scientific understanding of carcinogenesis and human biology towards interventions focused on cancer prevention, interception, screening, and early detection.  These mechanistic understandings can be informed by research conducted across basic science, epidemiology, behavioral, or clinical studies and by varied scientific disciplines. Early translational research spans preclinical (e.g., cell and tissue culture, animal models) to clinical (e.g., small early phase clinical trials) research and may include areas such as development and testing of interception agents (including small molecules, vaccines, and biologics), novel and precision methods for screening, early detection, and management of average- and high-risk cohorts, and early diagnostic biomarker development.  This research could draw upon areas such as molecular and systems biology, diagnostics, vaccine and drug development, pharmacology, and biomedical engineering, along with many other related disciplines. The ultimate objective of this research would be to develop novel human interventions and human-centered adaptation of current interventions with the potential to reduce cancer risk, incidence, and mortality, and improve quality of life. More information about potentially relevant research areas can be found by examining the mission and scientific scope of the Division of Cancer Prevention. For application acceptance in the subject area of Cancer Prevention, applicants must include “NOT-CA-24-023” (without quotation marks) in the Agency Routing Identifier field (box 4B) of the SF424 R&R form. NCI K01 applications without this information in box 4B will not be accepted and withdrawn. Note: The details on this page are for informational purposes only. Please read and follow all requirements and instructions in the notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) and the Table of IC-Specific Information linked therein before applying for an award. Application review information is described in the funding opportunity. If you have any questions before submitting your application, please contact the relevant NCI program staff listed at the end of this page. For more complete information, reference the Program Announcements PA-20-176 (Parent K01 Independent Clinical Trial Required), PA-20-190 (Parent K01 Independent Clinical Trial Not Allowed), and PA-20-191 (Parent K01 Independent Basic Experimental Studies with Humans Required) and/or contact the Program Director. Candidates still within postdoctoral non-independent, mentored positions are strongly encouraged to apply for a K99/R00 award if within the K99/R00 eligibility window. NCI-specific guidance on overlap between K01 applications and the mentor’s pending/active grants: The K01 award provides support for an intensive, mentored research career development experience in cancer control and population sciences and cancer prevention research. It is expected that the Research Plan be based on the candidate’s original ideas and/or hypotheses. The K01 project can be within the overall scope of the mentor’s research awards. However, there should be no text duplication or duplication of the scientific aims, and the candidate’s application should propose a scientific research question that is distinct from the mentor’s pending or active research grants. NCI will not support both a K01 and an active or pending research grant that propose substantially the same research. All NCI K01 applicants must justify the need for additional mentored training and explain how the training will facilitate their ability to conduct cutting-edge research in one of these topic areas.  Applicants must appropriately justify the duration of support, taking into consideration prior research experience and the proposed mentored career development goals that are essential for developing an independent, NCI-funded research program.  An application must include a strong and credible plan for the candidate’s transition to research independence, including milestones, and evidence of significant institutional commitment to the continued development of the K01 candidate as an independent researcher at the applicant institution. Applicants are expected to plan to apply for independent research support during the later years of their mentored career award.  Award project period: Up to 5 years with justification for a mentored training award for the requested duration.  Salary Support: Up to $100,000 plus fringe benefits per year.  Research support: Up to $50,000 per year.  At the time of the award the candidate must be: a United States citizen,  or a non-citizen national,  or must have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence and possess an Alien Registration Receipt Card (1-151 or 1-551) or some other verification of legal admission as a permanent resident.  Citizenship or green card is not needed to apply. Citizenship or green card is required at the time of award issuance. Postdoctoral Fellows with 2-5 years of postdoctoral research experience  Early-Stage Investigators with 2-5 years of postdoctoral research experience  Candidate must commit a minimum of 9 person months (75%) full-time professional effort to the K25 Career Development Award. 8% Not allowed Applications must be submitted electronically.  Applicants must follow the instructions in the SF424(R&R) Application Guide, as well as any program-specific instructions noted in Section IV. of the Program Announcement.  For application acceptance in the subject area of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, applicants must include “NOT-CA-24-022” (without quotation marks) in the Agency Routing Identifier field (box 4B) of the SF424 R&R form. NCI K01 applications without this information in box 4B will not be accepted and withdrawn.  For application acceptance in the subject area of Cancer Prevention, applicants must include “NOT-CA-24-023” (without quotation marks) in the Agency Routing Identifier field (box 4B) of the SF424 R&R form. NCI K01 applications without this information in box 4B will not be accepted and withdrawn.

Patients with Crohn disease were monitored until a median age of 27 years, and patients with ulcerative colitis were monitored until age 29 years.[1] During the follow-up period, 25  patients with Crohn disease (0.36%) were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, versus 43 reference individuals (0.06%). During the  follow-up period, 113 patients with ulcerative colitis (1.33%) were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, versus 45 reference individuals (0.05%). The hazard ratio (HR) for colorectal cancer was 6.46 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.95–10.6) in patients with Crohn disease and 32.5 (95% CI, 23.0–45.9) in patients with ulcerative colitis. The HR increased with decreasing age of diagnosis. The relative risk of colorectal cancer is very high in both childhood-onset Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, and age at diagnosis is an additional risk factor. These factors are potentially important when implementing a colorectal cancer surveillance program for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Everhov ÅH, Ludvigsson JF, Järås J, et al.: Colorectal Cancer in Childhood-onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Scandinavian Register-based Cohort Study, 1969-2017. J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr 75 (4): 480-484, 2022. [PUBMED Abstract] About 20% to 30% of adult patients with colorectal cancer have a significant history of familial cancer; of these, about 5% have a well-defined genetic syndrome.[1] Hereditary colorectal cancer has two well-described forms:[2,3] Polyposis (including familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP]  and attenuated FAP, which are caused by pathogenic variants in the APC gene; and MUTYH-associated polyposis, which is caused by pathogenic variants in the MUTYH gene).Familial polyposis is inherited as a dominant trait, which confers a high
degree of risk.  Early diagnosis and surgical removal of the colon eliminates
the risk of developing carcinomas of the large bowel.[4,5]  Some colorectal
carcinomas in young people, however, may be associated with a mutation of the
APC gene, which also is associated with an
increased risk of brain tumors and hepatoblastoma.[6]  FAP
syndrome is caused by mutation of a gene on chromosome 5q, which normally
suppresses proliferation of cells lining the intestine and later development of
polyps.[7] A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase I trial in children aged 10 to 14 years with FAP reported that celecoxib at a dose of 16 mg/kg per day is safe for up to 3 months. At this dose, there was a significant decrease in the number of polyps detected by colonoscopy.[8][Level of evidence B3] The role of celecoxib in the management of FAP in children is not clear. Lynch syndrome (often referred to as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), which is caused by germline pathogenic variants in DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) and EPCAM. Despite the increased risk of multiple malignancies in families with Lynch syndrome, the risk of malignant neoplasms during childhood in those families does not seem to be increased when compared with the risk in children from families with colorectal carcinoma that is not associated with Lynch syndrome.[9] Other colorectal cancer syndromes and their associated genes include oligopolyposis (POLE, POLD1),[3] NTHL1,[10] juvenile polyposis syndrome (BMPR1A, SMAD4), Cowden syndrome (PTEN), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (STK11).[2] For more information about these syndromes, see Genetics of Colorectal Cancer.Another tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 18 is associated with
progression of polyps to malignant tumors. Multiple colon
carcinomas have been associated with neurofibromatosis type I and
several other rare syndromes.[11] Familial polyposis is inherited as a dominant trait, which confers a high
degree of risk.  Early diagnosis and surgical removal of the colon eliminates
the risk of developing carcinomas of the large bowel.[4,5]  Some colorectal
carcinomas in young people, however, may be associated with a mutation of the
APC gene, which also is associated with an
increased risk of brain tumors and hepatoblastoma.[6]  FAP
syndrome is caused by mutation of a gene on chromosome 5q, which normally
suppresses proliferation of cells lining the intestine and later development of
polyps.[7] A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase I trial in children aged 10 to 14 years with FAP reported that celecoxib at a dose of 16 mg/kg per day is safe for up to 3 months. At this dose, there was a significant decrease in the number of polyps detected by colonoscopy.[8][Level of evidence B3] The role of celecoxib in the management of FAP in children is not clear.

progression of polyps to malignant tumors. Multiple colon
carcinomas have been associated with neurofibromatosis type I and
several other rare syndromes.[11] The incidence of these genetic syndromes in children is not well defined, but several studies have examined it, as follows: In one review, 16% of patients younger than 40 years had a predisposing factor for the development of colorectal cancer.[12] A later study documented immunohistochemical evidence of mismatch repair deficiency in 31% of colorectal carcinoma samples in patients aged 30 years or younger.[13] A retrospective review of patients younger than 18 years in Germany identified 31 patients with colorectal carcinoma.[14]  Eleven of the 26 patients who were tested for a genetic predisposition syndrome tested positive (eight cases of Lynch syndrome, one patient with FAP, and two patients with constitutional mismatch repair deficiency). When compared with the patients without a genetic predisposition syndrome, the 11 patients with a genetic predisposition syndrome presented with more localized disease, allowing complete surgical resection and improved outcome (100% survival).

Large series and reviews suggest that ascending and descending colon tumors are each seen in approximately 30% of cases, with rectal tumors occurring in approximately 25% of cases.[1-3] Right-sided tumors (cecum to transverse colon) were diagnosed in 28.6% of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cases. The proportion of right-sided colorectal cancers differed significantly by age group at diagnosis (38.3% of AYA patients aged 15–19 years vs. 27.3% of AYA patients aged 35–39 years).  The incidence of mucinous adenocarcinoma and signet ring cell carcinoma histopathological subtypes was higher in younger patients. Tumors of the ascending colon (right colon) may cause more subtle symptoms but are often associated with the following: Abdominal mass. Weight loss. Decreased appetite. Blood in the stool. Iron-deficiency anemia. Signs and symptoms in children with descending colon tumors include the following: Abdominal pain (most common). Rectal bleeding. Change in bowel habits. Weight loss. Nausea and vomiting. The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was about 3 months in one series.[4,5] Changes in bowel habits may be associated with tumors of the rectum or lower colon. Any tumor that causes complete obstruction of the large bowel can cause bowel perforation and spread of the tumor cells within the abdominal cavity.

Tumors with mucinous histology arise from the surface of the bowel, usually at the site of an adenomatous polyp.[5] The tumor may extend into the muscle layer surrounding the bowel, or the tumor may perforate the bowel entirely and seed through the spaces around the bowel, including intra-abdominal fat, lymph nodes, liver, ovaries, and the surface of other loops of bowel. A high incidence of metastasis involving the pelvis, ovaries, or both may be present in girls.[6] The tumors of younger patients with the mucinous histological variant may be less responsive to chemotherapy. In the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population with this histology, there is a higher incidence of signet ring cells, microsatellite instability, and mutations in the mismatch repair genes.[5,7,8] Colorectal cancers in younger patients with noninherited sporadic tumors often lack KRAS mutations and other cytogenetic anomalies seen in older patients.[9] A genomic study used exome and RNA sequencing to identify mutational differences in colorectal carcinomas of  adults (n = 30), AYA patients (n = 30), and children (n = 2). Five of the identified genes (MYCBP2, BRCA2, PHLPP1, TOPORS, and ATR)  were more frequently mutated in AYA patients. These genes contained a damaging mutation and were identified through whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing. In addition, higher mutational rates in DNA mismatch and DNA repair pathways, such as MSH2, BRCA2, and RAD9B, were more prevalent in AYA samples, but the results were not validated by RNA sequencing.[10] Saab R, Furman WL: Epidemiology and management options for colorectal cancer in children.

An analysis from the National Cancer Database, which tracks outcomes of patients with malignancies across 1,500 Commission on Cancer–accredited facilities, identified 531,462 patients with colon cancer between 2004 and 2016. There were 947 patients  aged 25 years or younger.[1]    Compared with those older than 25 years, the younger patients had more advanced disease (stage III: 44.4% vs. 33.4%; stage IV: 27.5% vs.15.3%) and higher rates of total colectomy (8.9% vs. 2.7%) and proctocolectomy (5.0% vs. 0.0%). Stage-for-stage, the 5-year survival rates were higher in patients aged 25 years or younger than in those older than 25 years.  This study had several limitations. The data presented in this study are registry based, and not all data points were collected for all patients. In addition, only 30% of hospitals in the United States are accredited by the Commission on Cancer. A retrospective analysis of patients examined at three tertiary referral hospitals in China between September 2000 and July 2019 identified 70 patients younger than  20 years with colorectal carcinoma.[2]  The most common primary tumor location was the left hemicolon (35.7%). The prominent pathological types were mucinous adenocarcinoma (22.9%) and signet ring cell carcinoma (22.9%). Nearly one-half (47.1%) of the patients presented with distant metastasis at diagnosis. Of the patients who received additional tumor testing, 23.8% (5 of 21) had deficient mismatch repair protein expression and 71.4% (5 of 7) had microsatellite instability-high disease. Another study from the National Cancer Database described the features and outcomes of 918 pediatric patients (aged <21 years), 157,577 young adult patients (aged 22–50 years), and 1,303,655 older adult patients (aged >50 years) with colorectal cancer.[3] Signet ring, mucinous, and poorly differentiated histology were more commonly seen in pediatric patients. Children and older patients had poorer 5-year overall survival rates when compared with early-onset adults and when adjusted for other covariates such as stage and pathology. Age younger than 21 years was a significant predictor of mortality caused by colon and rectal cancer. As with other publications from this group, the data presented in this study are registry based, which underestimates several variables, including outpatient therapy and predisposing factors and symptoms. This limitation may explain why a specific course for inferior outcomes in patients younger than  21 years could not be identified. A single-institution retrospective review compared 94 pediatric and young adult patients (aged <25 years) with 765 older patients.[4]This study reported a worse prognosis (stage-for-stage) and a higher rate of peritoneal metastasis for the younger patients. Nearly 30% of the pediatric patients in the cohort were known to have a predisposing cancer susceptibility diagnosis, most commonly Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, or Li-Fraumeni syndrome. A pediatric oncology group in the Netherlands performed a retrospective analysis of adolescents and adults aged 25 years or younger with colorectal cancer.  They analyzed clinical data and molecular and genetic features of colorectal tumor tissues from 139 AYA patients (age, ≤25 years; median age, 23 years; 58% male), collected between 2000 and 2017.  [5]Mucinous and/or signet ring cell components were observed in 33% of tumor samples. A genetic tumor-risk syndrome was confirmed in 39% of the patients. Factors associated with shorter survival time included younger age at diagnosis, signet ring cell carcinoma histology, the absence of a genetic tumor-risk syndrome, and advanced stage of disease at diagnosis. Compared with those older than 25 years, the younger patients had more advanced disease (stage III: 44.4% vs. 33.4%; stage IV: 27.5% vs.15.3%) and higher rates of total colectomy (8.9% vs. 2.7%) and proctocolectomy (5.0% vs. 0.0%). Stage-for-stage, the 5-year survival rates were higher in patients aged 25 years or younger than in those older than 25 years. This study had several limitations.

Factors associated with shorter survival time included younger age at diagnosis, signet ring cell carcinoma histology, the absence of a genetic tumor-risk syndrome, and advanced stage of disease at diagnosis. Survival is consistent with the advanced stage of disease observed in most children with colorectal cancer, with an overall mortality rate of approximately 70%. For patients with a complete surgical resection or for those with low-stage/localized disease, survival is significantly prolonged, with the potential for cure.[6] Akinkuotu AC, Maduekwe UN, Hayes-Jordan A: Surgical outcomes and survival rates of colon cancer in children and young adults.

This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following health care professionals and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
that will achieve optimal survival and quality of life: Primary care physicians. Pediatric surgeons. Radiation
oncologists. Pediatric medical oncologists/hematologists. Rehabilitation
specialists. Pediatric nurse specialists. Social workers. Child-life professionals. Psychologists. For information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on Supportive and Palliative Care. The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of pediatric patients
with cancer.[2]  At
these pediatric cancer centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy.  Most of the progress made in identifying curative
therapy for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[3-5]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[6] The U.S. Rare Diseases Act of 2002 defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare. The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[7,8] Also, the designation of a pediatric rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows: A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than 2 cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than 2 cases per 1 million people were also included  in the very rare group because there is a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[9] The Children's Oncology Group (COG) defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers, colorectal cancers, etc.).[10]  These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[4] Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years. Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years. These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the low number of patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the lack of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers. Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as Colon
Cancer Treatment and Rectal Cancer Treatment. Smith MA, Seibel NL, Altekruse SF, et al.: Outcomes for children and adolescents with cancer: challenges for the twenty-first century.

tumor or as microscopic deposits in lymph nodes, on the surface of the bowel,
or on intra-abdominal organs.[2,3] Treatment options for childhood colorectal cancer include the following: Surgery. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Other agents. Complete surgical excision is the most important prognostic factor and the primary goal of surgery, but it is often impossible. Removal of large
portions of tumor provides little benefit for those  with extensive
metastatic disease.[4] Most patients with microscopic metastatic disease
generally develop gross metastatic disease. Few individuals with metastatic
disease at diagnosis become long-term survivors. Current therapy includes the use of radiation for rectal and lower colon
tumors, in conjunction with chemotherapy using fluorouracil (5-FU) with
leucovorin.[5]  Other agents, including irinotecan, may be of value.[1][Level of evidence C1] A review of nine clinical trials comprising 138 patients younger than 40 years  demonstrated that the use of combination chemotherapy improved progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) in these patients. Furthermore, OS and response rates to chemotherapy were similar to those observed in older patients.[6][Level of evidence B4] No significant benefit has been determined for interferon-alfa
given in conjunction with 5-FU/leucovorin.[7] Ipilimumab and nivolumab demonstrated high response rates in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with microsatellite instability–high or mismatch repair–deficient metastatic colorectal cancer who had disease progression after treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan.[8] Other active agents used in adults include oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, panitumumab, cetuximab, aflibercept,  and regorafenib.[9-12] Hill DA, Furman WL, Billups CA, et al.: Colorectal carcinoma in childhood and adolescence: a clinicopathologic review.

Patient Stories   Newly Diagnosed  In Treatment  Having a Recurrence  Finished with Treatment  Guiding Questions  Managing Your Symptoms  Self-Care  Related Organizations  Patient Stories  A recurrence is when your tumor begins to grow or has come back. Even when treatment has finished, there is always a chance the tumor will recur. It is not possible for your doctor to know if or when your tumor will recur. Tumors often come back in the same spot as the original tumor. But it is possible for a brain and spine tumor to return in another location in the central nervous system (CNS). Signs and symptoms of a recurrent brain or spine tumor are often the same symptoms you had before, but can feel more pronounced. If you have worsening of your symptoms or new symptoms, it is important to talk to your health care team. You can also find strategies to manage your symptoms. Radiation oncologist Dr. Christina Tsien is a cancer survivor. She discusses the advances in radiation therapy that are improving brain and spine tumor patient outcomes and how her personal experience has impacted the care she provides. It is important to continue to be monitored by a neuro-oncologist after you complete treatment. Monitoring may include physical and neurologic exams and imaging of your brain or spine. By being monitored, your doctor will be able to detect a recurrent tumor and start treatment. Your treatment may include chemotherapy or you may join a clinical trial to test a new treatment. Finding out that your tumor has recurred can cause feelings of shock, anger, sadness, and fear. But this time you have something that you didn’t have before - experience. You’ve lived through cancer already and you know what to expect. Treatments also may have improved since you were first diagnosed. New drugs or therapies may be more successful and help with your treatment or in managing side effects. We understand that facing a recurrence can be scary and challenging for you and your family. Use these resources to help guide your treatment decisions, find support, and inspire you through another cancer journey. Tips for Rare Brain and Spine Tumor Patients NCI-CONNECT provides consultations for patients with rare central nervous system tumors free of charge. Questions to Ask Your Doctor or Surgeon if You Have a Recurrence  Questions to Ask Your Neurosurgeon  Questions to Ask Your Doctor About Your Treatment  Questions to Ask Your Doctor About Clinical Trials  Questions to Ask Your Doctor About Support  It is important to the success of your treatment to find a doctor that has experience treating your tumor type. Given brain and spine tumors are rare, there are few centers that have doctors with that level of expertise. Use our network of healthcare professionals to find an experienced doctor near you and get a second opinion. Giselle shares her treatment journey with five brain tumors over 23 years.

Director, Office of Cancer Survivorship at NCI Survivors of childhood cancer and their families know the challenges don’t always end with treatment. Helping them navigate life after cancer is Dr. Emily Tonorezos (she/her), director of NCI’s Office of Cancer Survivorship. “A lot happens to children who have been diagnosed with cancer that impacts their long-term quality of life,” said Emily. “We are working toward better understanding the needs of childhood cancer survivors and how to address those needs.” She added that capturing data on these patients, their cancers, and what treatments they receive with initiatives like CCDI is imperative for improving survivorship. In childhood cancer, said Emily, these data are already informing therapy, with researchers using molecular characterization to develop targeted and less toxic treatments with fewer lifelong effects. As CCDI and the Molecular Characterization Initiative expand access to data, better treatments with fewer side effects could emerge. “That’s the way of the future for childhood cancer,” she said.

Therefore, the information in this summary is no longer being updated and is provided for reference purposes only. The main ingredient of 714-X is  camphor, which comes from the wood and bark of the camphor tree (see Question 1). It is claimed that 714-X helps the immune system fight cancer (see Question 3). No study of 714-X has been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal to show it is safe or effective in treating cancer (see Question 6). 714-X is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration  for use in the United States (see Question 8). What is 714-X?The main ingredient in 714-X is made by combining chemicals with camphor, a natural substance that comes from the wood and bark of the camphor tree.  Ammonia and salt are added to camphor to make 714-X. What is the history of the discovery and use of 714-X as a complementary and alternative treatment for cancer?714-X was developed in the 1960s in  Canada, where it is still being made. Patients in Canada can get 714-X only from a doctor, for compassionate use (giving a treatment to patients before it is approved, because they have a life-threatening disease and there is no drug or other therapy to treat the disease).   714-X is used in Mexico and some western European countries. It is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States (see Question 8). What is the theory behind the claim that 714-X is useful in treating cancer?The development of 714-X was based on the theory that there are tiny living things in the blood called somatids. According to this theory, some types of somatids are found only in the blood of people who have cancer or other serious diseases. These types of somatids are said to make growth hormones that cause cells to grow without control. The makers of 714-X state that by looking at the number and type of somatids in the blood, doctors can see if cancer is starting to form or can diagnose cancer and predict where the cancer will spread. The theory states that cancer cells trap nitrogen needed by normal cells and make a toxic substance that weakens the immune system. 714-X is reported to help the body fight cancer cells in these ways: The camphor in 714-X is said to prevent cancer cells from taking nitrogen from the body's normal cells. 714-X is also said to   help the immune system by increasing the flow of lymph, the colorless fluid that travels through the body carrying white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Some research studies are published in scientific journals. Most scientific journals have experts who review research reports before they are published, to make sure that the evidence and conclusions are sound. This is called peer review. Studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals are considered to be better evidence. No studies have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals to support the theory of somatids in the development of cancer. Research  on the use of 714-X as a cancer treatment is discussed in Question 5 and Question 6. How is 714-X administered?714-X is usually given by injection near the lymph nodes in the groin.  In some patients with lung or oral cancer, 714-X can be sprayed into the nose using a nebulizer (a device that turns liquid into a fine spray).  The makers of 714-X do not recommend injecting it into a vein (intravenously) or taking it by mouth.  The makers of 714-X suggest the following:714-X is more effective if given early in the disease, before chemotherapy or radiation therapy is begun.714-X can be used along with conventional treatments.Vitamin B 12 supplements, vitamin E supplements, shark cartilage, and alcohol should not be used during treatment with 714-X. Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using 714-X?Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a drug, procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans. Animal tumor models are used to learn how a cancer may progress and to test new treatments. These preclinical studies are done before any testing in humans is begun. No laboratory studies of the safety and/or effectiveness of 714-X have been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.  A few animal experiments have been done, but the results of these experiments have not been reported in scientific journals.  The animal studies used a lymphosarcoma tumor model in rats and lymphoma tumor models in dogs and cows.  714-X was not found to be effective against cancer in these studies. Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of 714-X been conducted?No clinical trials or other studies with cancer patients have been published in 
peer-reviewed scientific journals to support the safety or effectiveness of 714-X.  A number of anecdotal reports (incomplete descriptions of the medical and treatment history of one or more patients) and testimonials (personal reports from people who claim to have been helped or cured by the product) have been published in newspapers and other nonmedical literature.
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) reviewed the records of some cancer patients who used 714-X. This review was done to decide if NCI should begin a clinical trial of the product. Not enough information was available to support recommending a trial. Have any side effects or risks been reported from 714-X?The makers of 714-X claim that it is not harmful to humans.  The reported side effects of treatment with 714-X are redness, tenderness, and swelling at the injection site. Is  714-X approved by the FDA as a cancer treatment in the United States?The FDA has not approved 714-X for use in the United States. The main ingredient in 714-X is made by combining chemicals with camphor, a natural substance that comes from the wood and bark of the camphor tree.  Ammonia and salt are added to camphor to make 714-X. 714-X was developed in the 1960s in  Canada, where it is still being made.

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish. PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the use of 714-X in the treatment of people with cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board. A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. The NCI Best Case Series Program   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research. When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: What side effects can be expected? What are the risks related to this therapy? What benefits can be expected from this therapy? Do the known benefits outweigh the risks? Will the therapy affect conventional treatment? Is this therapy part of a clinical trial? If so, who is the sponsor of the trial? Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?

	In January 2023, a CTPM was convened to develop clinical trials that explore novel treatment approaches for high-risk/resectable and advanced/un-resectable cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in immune suppressed populations. As immunotherapy is typically contraindicated in these patients, their treatment options are limited and their outcomes are worse. Read the executive summary.  TP53 Mutated Head and Neck Cancer 
	This CTPM, held in January 2021, was to develop clinical trials for patients with TP53 mutant HNSCC in locally advanced and metastatic recurrent disease with a focus on biomarkers and signal seeking trials that will improve survival and quality of life. Read the executive summary.  Naso-Pharyngeal Cancer 
	This CTPM, held in January 2018, focused on developing strategies for the incorporation of immunological agents such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies) into a definitive chemo-radiation treatment of NPC. Read the executive summary and the publication.  Immunotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer
	This CTPM, held in November 2014, provided an opportunity to highlight head and neck cancer as a model epithelial malignancy for the investigation of immunotherapy. Several proposals for clinical trials were developed. Read the executive summary and the publication.  Optimizing Treatment of Early Stage Thyroid Cancer
	In November 2013 a meeting was held to address appropriate management of early-stage thyroid cancer and consider the roles of active surveillance, immediate surgery, and systemic treatment.

This database helps identify gaps and duplicate studies in clinical research, facilitates clinical trial prioritization, and standardizes trial data capture and sharing. Key benefits of CTRP include: Standardized abstraction of protocol information  Consistent terminology and coding to optimize search and retrieval of cancer trials information  Structured biomarker data  Patient-level accrual data  Standardized person and organization data elements  Trials directly or indirectly funded by NCI have some degree of financial support by NCI. These include: All National trials (e.g., NCTN, ETCTN, NCORP)  All trials conducted at an NCI-Designated Cancer Center (with P30 center core grant), including all industrial trials  Trials conducted under any type of contract, grant, or cooperative agreement supported by the NCI (e.g., R01, N01, SPORE, P01, U01, U10)  All publicly available CTRP clinical trial information is made available through an application programming interface (API), which populates the clinical trials search feature on Cancer.gov. Information about the API can be found at https://clinicaltrialsapi.cancer.gov. Staff from NCI-Designated Cancer Centers and other grantees can log in to CTRP and perform searches on trials they have submitted. If a center requires a more detailed report on their trials, they may submit a request via the Clinical Trials Reporting Office (CTRO, ncictro@mail.nih.gov) and a CTRP analyst will work with them to generate a custom report. CTRP was established in response to a recommendation made by the NCI Clinical Trials Working Group (CTWG) to the National Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB). Key conclusions of the 2005 CTWG report: NCI had no electronic database that captured all cancer clinical trials directly or indirectly funded by NCI and their accrual  Trials funded by R01s, R21s, P01s, SPORE grants and institutionally-supported trials using NCI-funded Cancer Center infrastructure resources (P30) were particularly difficult to identify  Available databases did not allow NCI and the broader cancer community to monitor accrual, identify gaps and duplicative trials and prioritize the development of new clinical trials.  In 2015, the Clinical Trials Informatics Working Group (CTIWG) of the NCI Clinical Trials and Translational Research Advisory Committee (CTAC) was formed to advise the NCI on refining CTRP as a clinical trials portfolio management resource. The CTIWG report was accepted by CTAC in November 2017.  Updated:

Treatment  Childhood Liver Cancer  Health Professional  Research Advances   Causes & Risk Factors  Diagnosis  Stages  Treatment  Bile duct cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the bile ducts. Bile duct cancer is also called cholangiocarcinoma. A network of tubes, called ducts, connects the liver, gallbladder, and small intestine. This network begins in the liver where many small ducts collect bile (a fluid made by the liver to break down fats during digestion). The small ducts come together to form the right and left hepatic ducts, which lead out of the liver. The two ducts join outside the liver and form the common hepatic duct. The cystic duct connects the gallbladder to the common hepatic duct. Bile from the liver passes through the hepatic ducts, common hepatic duct, and cystic duct and is stored in the gallbladder. When food is being digested, bile stored in the gallbladder is released and passes through the cystic duct to the common bile duct and into the small intestine. There are two types of bile duct cancer: Intrahepatic bile duct cancer: This type of cancer forms in the bile ducts inside the liver. Only a small number of bile duct cancers are intrahepatic. Intrahepatic bile duct cancers are also called intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas.EnlargeAnatomy of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Intrahepatic bile ducts are a network of small tubes that carry bile inside the liver. The smallest ducts, called ductules, come together to form the right and left hepatic ducts, which lead out of the liver. The two ducts join outside the liver and form the common hepatic duct. The cystic duct from the gallbladder joins the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. The common bile duct passes through the pancreas and ends in the small intestine. Bile is made by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. When food is being digested, bile is released from the gallbladder and passes through the common bile duct, pancreas, and ampulla of Vater into the small intestine. Extrahepatic bile duct cancer: This type of cancer forms in the bile ducts outside the liver. The two types of extrahepatic bile duct cancer are perihilar bile duct cancer and distal bile duct cancer:Perihilar bile duct cancer: This type of cancer is found in the area where the right and left bile ducts exit the liver and join to form the common hepatic duct. Perihilar bile duct cancer is also called a Klatskin tumor or perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.Distal bile duct cancer: This type of cancer is found in the area where the ducts from the liver and gallbladder join to form the common bile duct. The common bile duct passes through the pancreas and ends in the small intestine. Distal bile duct cancer is also called extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.EnlargeAnatomy of the extrahepatic bile ducts. Extrahepatic bile ducts are small tubes that carry bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine.  They are made up of the common hepatic duct (perihilar region) and the common bile duct (distal region). Bile is made in the liver and flows through the common hepatic duct and the cystic duct to the gallbladder, where it is stored. When food is being digested,  bile is released from the gallbladder and flows through the common bile duct, pancreas, and ampulla of Vater into the small intestine. Perihilar bile duct cancer: This type of cancer is found in the area where the right and left bile ducts exit the liver and join to form the common hepatic duct. Perihilar bile duct cancer is also called a Klatskin tumor or perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. Distal bile duct cancer: This type of cancer is found in the area where the ducts from the liver and gallbladder join to form the common bile duct. The common bile duct passes through the pancreas and ends in the small intestine. Distal bile duct cancer is also called extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by bile duct cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes) dark urine clay colored stool pain in the abdomen fever itchy skin nausea and vomiting weight loss for an unknown reason There are no routine screening tests to check for bile duct cancer before signs and symptoms occur.

Stories of Discovery


Milestones in Cancer Research and Discovery   Annual Report to the Nation  Research Advances by Cancer Type  Stories of Discovery  Milestones in Cancer Research and Discovery  Adam, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivor An avid fire juggler, 19-year old Adam is used to challenging himself. The diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in 2015, however, stands as the biggest challenge he has faced. He was relieved when standard treatments put it into remission. But during winter break of his freshman year of college, a checkup revealed the cancer was back. Just months prior to Adam’s cancer recurrence, FDA approved the first CAR T-cell therapy for patients with ALL. It is an immunotherapy that attacks leukemia cells with a specific protein on their surface. Adam’s doctors hoped he would be one of the first patients treated with this new therapy. Adam was disappointed to learn that the FDA-approved therapy would not work for him as his leukemia did not express enough of the right protein. However, his cancer did have high levels of another protein that other CAR T-cell therapies target, and Adam enrolled on an NCI intramural clinical trial testing one of them. He received his CAR-T cells in May 2018. Adam does not know if this experimental treatment will benefit him but is not hesitant about participating in a trial. As a physics major and cancer patient, he understands the importance of research. After being diagnosed, he had decided, “A clinical trial was on my bucket list,” he said. He expects researchers will learn from his cancer so that progress can happen faster.  Posted:
