NCI receives its funding, or appropriation, trom Congress as part of the overall federal budget process.

 

STEP 1

The White House Office of
Management & Budget (OMB)
coordinates with federal
agencies to formulate the
President's Budget, which covers
all federal agencies, including
the National Cancer institute
{NCII and National institutes of
Health (NIH), and reflects the
President's priorities. The
President submits the budget to
Congress, which must pass
appropriations legislation that
funds federal agencies.

to the President.

 

NCI Professional Judgment Authority

The National Cancer Act of 1971 gives the NCI Director special authority to submit an annual professional judgment
budget directly to the President for review and delivery to Congress. This budget reflects NCI cancer research priorities
and identifies areas of potential investment in cancer research.

ENDING CANCER AS WE KNOW IT FOR ALL

WHY SUPPORTING THE BEST IDEAS INCANCER RESEARCH
REQUIRES FUNDING INCREASES OVER TIME

Every year, new ideas require
funding to fuel future
breakthroughs

 

RO1 GRANTS: A SOURCE OF INNOVATIVE IDEAS

RO1s are a type of competitive research project grant that supports investigator-initiated
research, These grants enable researchers to translate their ideas into evidence, the
foundation for advances that help people with cancer and those at risk.

Originates g RO1 Grant Male New Advances

 

 

 

 

~ 5 YEARS ~

In fiscal year (FY) 2021, NCI received 6,178 applications for new RO1s.
That's 47% more than in FY 2013. Yet, during that time span, the NCI
budget increased only 32%.

 

   

GRANTS ARE MULTIYEAR COMMITMENTS

Each new RO1 grant creates a financial commitment for the initial year and up to 4 subsequent
years (referred to as out-years). The new group of grants NCI funds each year represents a
cohort of awards with a multiyear financial commitment.

FUNDING MORE NEW ROI GRANTS EACH YEAR:
AN INCREASING STAIR-STEP EFFECT ON NCI'S COSTS

NCI must have sustained funding increases to support as many new ideas as possible, to take
advantage of emerging opportunities, and to attract and retain the cancer research workforce.

  
 
  
 
  

A Inany given year, NCI funds new grants
and out-year costs for existing grants.

to live longer, healthier lives.
