ttle: OHAM HIV AIDS Research Programs - NCI
@: https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/oham/hiv-aids-research/oham-research
txt: AIDS lymphoma tissue micro-array and a photomicrograph of AIDS lymphoma. OHAM programs extend across the spectrum of research, training, international studies, and clinical trials to address the clinically, socially, and demographically diverse population of HIV/AIDS patients. OHAM contributes to and has shared oversight for a number of training, research, and clinical trial efforts across the NIH and beyond. As the epidemic evolves and the needs of patients change shape, OHAM programs are at the forefront of identifying and delivering the most effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for patients impacted by HIV/AIDS and HIV-associated malignancies. The AIDS Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR) is a biorepository for HIV-infected human biospecimens obtained from a wide spectrum of HIV-related or associated diseases, including cancer, and from appropriate HIV-negative controls. The AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) is an NCI-supported clinical trials group founded in 1995 to support innovative trials for HIV-associated malignancies. The International Conference on Malignancies in HIV/AIDS (ICMH), formerly known as The International Conference on Malignancies in AIDS and Other Acquired Immunodeficiencies (ICMAOI), is a conference presented by the Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy. NCI and the Fogarty International Center (FIC) have partnered in several efforts for developing research capacity in LMICs on HIV-associated cancers. OHAM interfaces with the Office of AIDS Research and other Institutes and Centers to coordinate HIV/AIDS training, research, and clinical trial efforts conducted throughout the NIH more effectively. Also, OHAM has shared oversight for a number of the trans-NIH and other collaborative programs described below. The CFAR program at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides administrative and shared research support to enhance and coordinate high quality HIV research projects, including HIV-associated malignancies. CFARs accomplish this through core facilities that provide expertise, resources, and services not otherwise readily obtained through more traditional funding mechanisms. Co-funded by seven NIH Institutes, CFARs promote interdisciplinary collaboration to accelerate translation of laboratory findings into clinical applications. The HIV Research Training Program provides training for scientists from institutions in low- and middle-income countries to strengthen HIV-related research. Institutions in the United States with strong HIV-related research training experience receive grants to establish full research training programs at institutions in these countries. The collaborative effort enables the development of multidisciplinary biomedical, behavioral, and social science research capacities for the prevention, care, and treatment of HIV/AIDS and HIV-related conditions in resource-poor settings. The NCI partners with the HIV Research Training Program grantees to expand research training related to HIV-associated malignancies in these countries. The IeDEA is a consortium of regional centers that collect and harmonize high quality data from HIV/AIDS research efforts throughout the world. This initiative provides a means to effectively pool the collected data—thus providing a cost effective avenue of generating large data sets that can address unique and evolving research questions in HIV/AIDS, including cancer-related questions, currently unanswerable by single cohorts. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) combined to form the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS). The new combined cohort will focus on studies addressing HIV-related comorbidities including malignancies, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematological, brain and central nervous system, oral and dental health, and women's and men's health.  For decades the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) was the primary steward of the MACS and WIHS  but in 2019 the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) became the primary steward for the MACS/WIHS-CCS. The MACS was established in 1984 to investigate the epidemiology of HIV infection. The study enrolled men who have sex with men (MSM), reflecting the highest risk at the time, and focused on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as a primary outcome. Ten years later, the WIHS was established to study HIV infection in women using similar methodology. Both studies have provided a better understanding of both the natural and treated history of HIV infection in the United States. NCI supported both the MACS and WIHS to provide data on the incidence of AIDS-defining and non-AIDS defining cancers and to conduct studies to better understand the pathogenesis of certain cancers. Data and specimens collected from study participants have been compiled in a National Repository that serves as a highly valuable resource in deepening the understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. Data and specimens collected from the MACS/WIHS-CCS  will become part of this resource. The purpose of this initiative is to foster, stimulate, and/or expand basic, translational, behavioral and applied research that will advance scientific discovery and engage U.S. and South African researchers working collaboratively in the areas of TB, HIV/AIDS biomedical and behavioral science, and HIV-related co-morbidities, including malignancies. NCI’s participation in this initiative will enhance scientific knowledge in HIV-related malignancies and increase collaborations between U.S. and South African investigators. The establishment of this collaborative is supported by research project grant (R01) The global burden of people living with HIV is estimated to be 33.3 million. The developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa, is the region most affected by the epidemic. These same regions are also experiencing a continued increase in AIDS-defining malignancies; as access to antiretroviral therapy becomes more widespread and people are no longer dying from opportunistic infections, non-AIDS defining malignancies will begin to have a major impact. A number of OHAM activities are addressing this global burden of HIV/AIDS and HIV-associated malignancies, either as their main focus or as part of a larger endeavor. The OHAM activities with a substantial international component include:    OHAM Research Activities OHAM-Managed Research Activities Trans-NIH and Other Collaborative Activities International Activities U.S.-South Africa Program for Collaborative Biomedical Research

ttle: NIH study finds regular aspirin use may reduce ovarian cancer risk - NCI
@: https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/aspirinreducedovariancancer
txt: 240-760-6600 Women who take aspirin daily may reduce their risk of ovarian cancer by 20 percent, according to a study by scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health. However, further research is needed before clinical recommendations can be made. The study was published Feb. 6, 2014, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. It is estimated that over 20,000 women in the United States will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2014, and more than 14,000 will die from the disease. Early stage ovarian cancer may be successfully treated. However, symptoms associated with this disease can mimic more common conditions, such as digestive and bladder disorders, so for this reason and others, it is often not diagnosed until it has reached advanced stages. Late stage ovarian cancer leaves women with limited treatment options and poor prognoses, making preventive strategies potentially important for controlling this disease. Chronic or persistent inflammation has been shown to increase the risk of cancer and other diseases. Previous studies have suggested that the anti-inflammatory properties of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), may reduce cancer risk overall. However, studies examining whether use of these agents may influence ovarian cancer risk have been largely inconclusive. This is the largest study to date to assess the relationship between these drugs and ovarian cancer risk. Britton Trabert, Ph.D., and Nicolas Wentzensen, M.D., Ph.D., of NCI’s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, and their colleagues, analyzed data pooled from 12 large epidemiological studies to investigate whether women who used aspirin, non-aspirin NSAIDs, or acetaminophen have a lower risk of ovarian cancer. These 12 studies (nine from the United States) were part of the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. The scientists evaluated the benefit of these drugs in nearly 8,000 women with ovarian cancer and close to 12,000 women who did not have the disease. Among study participants who reported whether or not they used aspirin regularly: 18 percent used aspirin, 24 percent used non-aspirin NSAIDs, and 16 percent used acetaminophen. The researchers determined that participants who reported daily aspirin use had a 20 percent lower risk of ovarian cancer than those who used aspirin less than once per week. For non-aspirin NSAIDs, which include a wide variety of drugs, the picture was less clear: the scientists observed a 10 percent lower ovarian cancer risk among women who used NSAIDs at least once per week compared with those who used NSAIDs less frequently. However, this finding did not fall in a range that was significant statistically. In contrast to the findings for aspirin and NSAIDs, use of acetaminophen, which is not an anti-inflammatory agent, was not associated with reduced ovarian cancer risk. This study adds to a growing list of malignancies, such as colorectal and other cancers, that appear to be potentially preventable by aspirin usage. “Our study suggests that aspirin regimens, proven to protect against heart attack, may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer as well. However intriguing our results are, they should not influence current clinical practice. Additional studies are needed to explore the delicate balance of risk-benefit for this potential chemopreventive agent, as well as studies to identify the mechanism by which aspirin may reduce ovarian cancer risk,” said Trabert. Adverse side effects of daily aspirin use include upper gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke. Therefore, a daily aspirin regimen should only be undertaken with a doctor’s approval, caution the scientists. # # #  B Trabert, et al.

ttle: FDA Approves First Immunotherapy Treatment for Lung Cancer - NCI
@: https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2015/fda-opdivo
txt:  ,
    by    NCI Staff On March 4, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved (Opdivo) to treat patients with advanced (NSCLC) that has progressed during or after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Nivolumab, which was initially approved for the treatment of metastatic , is the first drug to be approved to treat lung cancer. It works by inhibiting a protein receptor called PD-1 on T cells, a type of immune cell. PD-1 belongs to a family of so-called checkpoint proteins that, when activated, serve as a brake on the immune system. Nivolumab prevents tumor cells from communicating through the PD-1 protein to inactivate T cells, allowing the immune system to attack the tumor cells. The FDA based the approval on findings from a randomized phase III trial that enrolled 272 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who were assigned to receive either nivolumab or the chemotherapy drug . Results from the phase III trial have yet to be published or presented at a scientific meeting, but, , participants who received nivolumab had a 41% reduction in the risk of death and lived on average 3.2 months longer than those who received docetaxel. Approximately 30 percent of patients treated with nivolumab were alive 2 years after beginning treatment compared to 13 percent of patients treated with docetaxel. The FDA also cited safety and efficacy data from a that included 117 participants whose cancer had progressed after they had received a platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other prior systemic treatment. According to updated results from the trial (unpublished but available in the nivolumab ), 17 participants (14.5 percent) experienced a reduction in tumor size, of whom 59 percent had response durations of 6 months or longer. Median overall survival was 8.2 months and overall survival at 1 year was 40.8 percent. The most common side effects in the clinical trials were fatigue, shortness of breath, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, cough, nausea, and constipation. “The fact that we now have evidence of efficacy in the most common lethal tumor, non-small cell lung cancer, solidly cements immunotherapy as a critical tool in our fight against cancer,” said James Gulley, M.D., director of the Medical Oncology Service in the . “The rapid and durable responses seen with immune checkpoint inhibitors is a unique aspect of their clinical activity,” Dr. Gulley added. Researchers are already testing combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with other therapeutic modalities “to further increase the proportion of patients who respond,” he said. February 22, 2024,

ttle: Precision Medicine Initiative® and Cancer Research - NCI
@: https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2015/precision-medicine-initiative-2016
txt:  ,
    by    Harold Varmus, M.D. This is a transformational moment for cancer research. Thanks to the investment by Congress in NCI and NIH research, we have arrived at a new understanding of cancer. We now recognize that cancers are fundamentally diseases of the genome and that understanding cancer begins by identifying the abnormal genes and proteins that confer the risk of developing cancer. Identifying and analyzing these abnormalities will define how we diagnose cancer, determine how we develop and use targeted therapies to treat cancer, and shape the strategies we use to prevent cancer. After decades of research, we are poised to enter a new era of medical practice where detailed genetic and other molecular information about a patient's cancer is routinely used to deploy effective, patient-specific remedies to treat it. We are about to enter the era of precision medicine. The President’s Budget for NCI for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 contains funding increases for priority research to advance the field of precision medicine. As NCI focuses on oncology research under this FY 2016 initiative, increases proposed for other NIH institutes will advance precision medicine in other fields of science. Under the , NCI will assemble and analyze additional genomic data sets to increase our understanding of cancer genomes and their relationship to gene variants that a patient may have inherited. Based on the genomic information we uncover, NCI will test new therapies against childhood cancers and several common adult cancers. NCI will also develop better animal and cell-based models of cancer, study mechanisms of drug resistance, and identify new therapies and therapy combinations to overcome drug resistance. NCI will build on what it has already learned in ways that will accelerate the pace of discovery and deliver benefits to patients through clinical practice. Under the Precision Medicine Initiative, NCI will target funding increases to three broad areas. NCI will conduct the priority activities of the initiative through competitive grants, cooperative clinical research, and research and development contracts. For more details about how NCI will work with NIH on the Precision Medicine Initiative, see the editorial entitled . Cancer presents an exceptionally promising opportunity to refine the principles and practices that will serve as the foundation for precision medicine. With additional resources in its FY 2016 budget, NCI will increase funding to support clinical trials that offer two distinct approaches to advancing precision medicine. The first approach recruits patients with all types of cancer, and then selects a targeted drug based on the specific genetic abnormalities of the patient's tumor. NCI is using this approach in its Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice ( ) Program, which enrolls pediatric and adult patients with tumors that no longer respond to standard therapy. The second approach, demonstrated in the NCI Lung-MAP study, recruits patients with one type of cancer and then subdivides patients into genomically defined subsets, treating each subset with a different targeted drug. Both types of trials have important and achievable goals: Another feature of these trials is the opportunity to link their genomic findings to clinical data, lifestyle risks such as tobacco use and obesity, environmental mutagens, and viral infections. This additional feature will become a resource to support further discovery and identify new strategies for cancer prevention, early diagnosis and early intervention. A major obstacle to successfully treating cancer is the challenge of resistance either to new, targeted therapies or to traditional chemotherapies. To address this challenge, NCI will support additional research to uncover the mechanisms of resistance by: NCI will also build information platforms to support the integration of genetic information about tumors with data on how the tumors respond to therapy. This is the knowledge system envisioned in a 2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report entitled . As the IOM recommends, the NCI system will integrate molecular and clinical knowledge in ways that are useful to both scientists and clinicians. NCI’s knowledge system will incorporate genetic, biochemical, environmental and clinical data from patients to define molecular subtypes and identify the approaches to cancer care that will improve patient outcomes. This component of the Precision Medicine Initiative is based on the expectation that the “big data” that emerges from precision medicine trials can be used to construct models that predict, with increasing accuracy, response to treatment. This FY 2016 initiative rests on a solid foundation of NCI programs that support and advance precision medicine. NCI will continue this ongoing work as it also supports new and expanded precision medicine research under the FY 2016 initiative. The most conspicuous application of the principles of precision medicine appears in ongoing NCI programs to identify targeted therapeutics, such as the National Clinical Trials Network ( ), the NCI Community Oncology Research Program ( ), the NCI Early Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network ( ), and the NCI-MATCH Program. These programs use molecular methods to identify drugs that will deliver optimum results for treating tumors. In addition, NCI is also focusing on patients identified as exceptional responders based on their strong and favorable response to investigational drugs or conventional chemotherapy. NCI is conducting genetic assessments of tumors from these exceptional responders to learn about the basis of their favorable response. In its established programs in genomics research, NCI is using high-throughput techniques to identify and study small mutations, rearrangements, and chemical modifications of DNA and to detect changes in the production of RNA and proteins. Through programs such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) Initiative, and the Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTD ) Network, NCI is supporting research and related translational and clinical science activities that are making important advances in precision medicine. NCI also supports precision medicine research through programs such as the Tumor Microenvironment Initiative ( ), the Integrative Cancer Biology Program ( ), and through NCI intramural programs such as those focusing on genomics and chromosome biology. As NCI identifies the potential of tumors to alter their genetic code and generate potent antigens, immunotherapy is becoming an integral part of precision medicine. NCI continues to support many extramural grantees and intramural investigators who are working to treat cancers using immunotherapy. The technology to precisely measure, monitor and diagnose tumor progression and regression is essential to affirm the success of precision medicine. Through programs such as NCI's and The , NCI is developing and refining tools to help oncologists make decisions about the optimum cancer treatment pathways for individual patients. Finally, components of other NCI basic and translational science programs, including investigator-initiated competitive grants, NCI research and development contracts, and programs such as the RAS Initiative are also making important contributions to precision medicine, which demonstrates the breadth of NCI efforts in this field.

ttle: Gardasil 9 Protects against Additional HPV Types - NCI
@: https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical/research/gardasil9-prevents-more-hpv-types
txt: In a large randomized clinical trial, a new (HPV) vaccine effectively prevented infection and disease caused by nine HPV types, including seven types that cause cervical and other cancers—five of which were not covered by the previously available HPV vaccines—and two types that cause genital warts. , February 18, 2015 (See the .) HPV infections are the most common sexually transmitted infections in the United States. More than 40 HPV types can be spread through direct sexual contact. Of these, about a dozen, including HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, are high-risk—that is, persistent infection with these HPV types can cause cellular changes that may progress to cancer, including , , , , , and cancers. HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for approximately 70 percent of all cervical cancers and HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 are responsible for another 20 percent of cervical cancers. Until December 2014, the FDA had approved two vaccines to protect against HPV infection: , a that protects against infection with HPV types 16 and 18, and , a that protects against infection with HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. Types 6 and 11 are low-risk types that do not cause cancer but can cause warts on or around the genitals, anus, mouth, or throat. Researchers have been working on developing next-generation HPV vaccines that protect against additional high-risk HPV types. In December 2014, based on the results of this clinical trial, the FDA approved the 9-valent vaccine , which protects against infection with HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58. In a international clinical trial, researchers randomly assigned 14,215 women between the ages of 16 and 26 to receive Gardasil or Gardasil 9. As part of the clinical trial, a small dose-finding study was first done to determine the dose that would be used in the larger efficacy study. Participants were eligible if they had no history of an abnormal , no more than four lifetime sexual partners, and no previous abnormal finding on a cervical biopsy. Women in each group received three intramuscular injections of the vaccine over 6 months. The study’s was the incidence of cervical, vulvar, or vaginal disease, including high-grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, , cervical cancer, high-grade , high-grade , vulvar cancer, and vaginal cancer. Secondary endpoints included safety and the ability of the vaccine to provoke an immune response (vaccine immunogenicity), as measured by responses to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. Elmar A. Joura, M.D., of the Medical University of Vienna, Comprehensive Cancer Center in Austria, led the trial, which was sponsored by Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., the maker of Gardasil and Gardasil 9. Among study participants who did not have a documented HPV infection at the time of their first vaccine injection and who received all three doses, the number of cases of cervical, vulvar, or vaginal disease related to HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 was much lower among patients who received the 9-valent vaccine compared with those who received the quadrivalent vaccine (1 versus 30 cases). The efficacy rate of the 9-valent vaccine was 96.7 percent. Gardasil 9 was as effective as Gardasil at generating an antibody response against the four HPV types targeted by both vaccines. All cases of high-grade disease detected in the Gardasil 9 group occurred in participants who were HPV-infected when they received their first vaccine dose, which underscores the importance of vaccinating women and girls before they are exposed to HPV, the authors noted. The safety of Gardasil 9 was evaluated in more than 7,000 women. Adverse events related to the injection site, including mild or moderate pain, swelling, redness, and itching, were more common in the Gardasil 9 group than in the Gardasil group. The rate of adverse systemic events—headache, fever, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue—were similar in the two groups. The researchers compared Gardasil 9 to Gardasil and did not include a placebo control group. Consequently, the researchers were unable to directly determine the efficacy of Gardasil 9 in preventing diseases associated with the HPV types the vaccines have in common (HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18). However, because Gardasil 9 generated an antibody response similar to that generated by Gardasil and because the incidence of disease related to these four HPV types were similar, the authors concluded that Gardasil 9 would have similar efficacy to Gardasil in preventing diseases associated with these four HPV types. The study authors noted that longer-term follow-up of participants vaccinated with Gardasil 9 is needed to provide information on the durability of protection. This study represents “a milestone in expanding the coverage of cancers associated with the human papillomavirus,” wrote Anne Schuchat, M.D., of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in in . But even with a vaccine that provides protection against more high-risk HPV types, Dr. Schuchat noted that “vaccination of a much higher proportion of preteens is needed. Otherwise, decades from now oncologists will still be talking about HPV-associated cancers with thousands of new patients every year.” Aimée Kreimer, Ph.D., of NCI’s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, said she is hopeful that Gardasil 9 will protect against HPV infections for the same duration as the earlier HPV vaccines have demonstrated thus far. Dr. Kreimer also noted that “it will be important to know if currently approved HPV vaccines, including Gardasil 9, may also be given in a reduced dosage schedule without diminishing their efficacy.” This would help “to maximize their benefit in regions of the world where HPV-associated cancers are the leading cause of cancer death in women and among segments of the U.S. population where coverage has been low.”    Gardasil 9 Vaccine Protects against Additional HPV Types Summary Source Background The Study Results Limitations Comment

ttle: Last Days of Life (PDQ®) - NCI
@: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-hp-pdq
txt: Despite progress in developing treatments that have improved life expectancies for patients with advanced-stage cancer, the American Cancer Society estimates that 611,720 Americans will die of cancer in 2024.[ ] People with cancer die under various circumstances.  A report of the Dartmouth Atlas Project analyzed Medicare data from 2007 to 2010 for cancer patients older than 65 years who died within 1 year of diagnosis.[ ] Across the United States, 25% of patients died in a hospital, with 62% hospitalized at least once in the last month of life. In addition, 29% of patients were admitted to an intensive care unit in the last month of life. Approximately 6% of patients nationwide received chemotherapy in the last month of life. Conversely, about 61% of patients who died used hospice service. However, the average length of stay in hospice was only 9.1 days, and 11% of patients were enrolled in the last 3 days of life. Significant regional variations in the descriptors of end-of-life (EOL) care remain unexplained. Patient and family preferences may contribute to the observed patterns of care at the EOL. Patient recall of EOL discussions, spiritual care, or early palliative care, however, are associated with less-aggressive EOL treatment and/or increased utilization of hospice.[ - ] In addition, death in a hospital has been associated with poorer quality of life and increased risk of psychiatric illness among bereaved caregivers.[ ] Thus, it is important to help patients and their families articulate their goals of care and preferences near the EOL. For more information, see . This summary provides clinicians with information about anticipating the EOL; the common symptoms patients experience as life ends, including in the final hours to days; and treatment or care considerations. The decisions commonly made by patients, families, and clinicians are also highlighted, with suggested approaches. The goal of this summary is to provide essential information for high-quality EOL care. In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed.  The evidence and application to practice related to children may differ significantly from information related to adults.  When specific information about the care of children is available, it is summarized under its own heading. Providing excellent care toward the end of life (EOL) requires an ability to anticipate when to focus mainly on palliation of symptoms and quality of life instead of disease treatment.[ ] Prognostic information plays an important role for  making treatment decisions and planning for the  EOL. However, the available literature suggests that medical providers inaccurately predict how long patients will live and tend to overestimate survival times.[ , ] This appears to hold true even for providers who are experienced in treating patients who are terminally ill. In a multicenter cohort study of 230 hospitalized patients with advanced cancer, palliative care providers correctly predicted time to death for  only 41% of patients. Survival time was overestimated in 85% of patients for whom medical providers gave inaccurate predictions, and providers were  particularly likely to overestimate survival for Black and Latino patients.[ ] Providers attempting to make prognostic determinations may attend to symptoms that may herald the EOL, or they may observe trends in patients’ functional status. For more information, see the section. For example, one group of investigators [ ] retrospectively analyzed nearly 71,000 Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) scores obtained from a cohort of 11,374 adult outpatients with cancer who were assessed by physicians or nurses at the time of clinic visits.  The PPS is an 11-point scale describing a patient’s level of ambulation, level of activity, evidence of disease, ability to perform self-care, nutritional intake, and level of consciousness. The investigators assigned patients to one of four states: Of the 4,806 patients who died during the study period, 49% were recorded as being in the transitional state, and 46% were recorded  as being in the stable state. For a patient who was in the transitional state, the probability of dying within a month  was 24.1%, which was less than that for a patient in the EOL state (73.5%). The results suggest that serial measurement of the PPS may aid patients and clinicians in identifying the approach of the EOL. In contrast to the data indicating that clinicians are relatively poor independent prognosticators, a study published in 2019 compared the relative accuracies of the PPS, the Palliative Prognostic Index, and the Palliative Prognostic Score with clinicians' predictions of survival for patients with advanced cancer who were admitted to an inpatient palliative care unit. At study enrollment, the investigators calculated the scores from the three prognostication tools for 204 patients and asked the unit’s palliative care attending physician to estimate each patient’s life expectancy (0–14 days, 15–42 days, or over 42 days). Reasons for admission included pain (90.7%), bowel obstruction (48.0%), delirium (36.3%), dyspnea (34.8%), weakness (27.9%), and nausea (23.5%).[ ] The study found that all four prognostic measures had similar levels of accuracy, with the exception of clinician predictions of survival, which were more accurate for 7-day survival. The authors hypothesized that clinician predictions of survival may be comparable or superior to prognostication tools for patients with shorter prognoses (days to weeks of survival) and may become less accurate for patients who live for months or longer.[ ] However, clinician predictions of survival may have been unusually accurate in this study because of the evaluators’ subspecialty experience in palliative care and the more predictable environment and patient population of an acute palliative care unit. or refers to the process in which patients who are expected to die within 3 days exhibit a constellation of symptoms.[ ] In the final days of life, patients often experience progressive decline in their neurocognitive, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and muscular function, which is  characteristic of the dying process. A number of highly specific clinical signs can be used to help clinicians establish the diagnosis of impending death (i.e., death within days).[ , ] Impending death is a diagnostic issue rather than a prognostic phenomenon because it is an irreversible physiological process. The ability to diagnose impending death with confidence is of utmost importance to clinicians because it could affect their communication with patients and families and inform complex health care decisions such as:[ , ] Because clinicians often overestimate survival,[ , ] they often hesitate to diagnose impending death without adequate supporting evidence. One study examined five signs in cancer patients recognized as actively dying.  Investigators reported that the median time to death from the onset of death rattle was 23 hours; from the onset of respiration with mandibular movement, 2.5 hours; from the onset of cyanosis in extremities, 1 hour; and from the onset of pulselessness on the radial artery, 2.6 hours.[ ] The Investigating the Process of Dying study systematically  examined physical signs in 357 consecutive cancer patients.[ ]  Among the ten target physical signs, there were three early signs and seven late signs.  The early signs had high frequency, occurred more than 1 week before death, and had moderate predictive value that a patient would die in 3 days. Early signs included the following: The late signs occurred mostly in the last 3 days of life, had lower frequency, and were highly specific for impending death in 3 days. Late signs included the following:[ ] In particular, the high positive likelihood ratios (LRs) of pulselessness on the radial artery (positive LR, 15.6), respiration with mandibular movement (positive LR, 10), decreased urine output (≤200 cc/d) (positive LR, 15.2), Cheyne-Stokes breathing (positive LR, 12.4), and death rattle (positive LR, 9) suggest that these physical signs can be  useful for the diagnosis of impending death.[ ] Because of low sensitivity, the absence of these signs cannot rule out impending death. A prospective observational study that examined vital signs in the last 7 days of life reported that blood pressure and oxygen saturation decreased as death approached. However, a large proportion of patients had normal vital signs, even in the last 12 hours of life. Moderate changes in vital signs from baseline could not definitively rule in or rule out impending death in 3 days.  Therefore, predicting death is difficult, even with careful and repeated observations.[ ] Several other late signs that have been found to be useful for the diagnosis of impending death include the following:[ ] In conclusion, bedside physical signs may be useful in helping clinicians diagnose impending death with greater confidence, which can, in turn, assist in clinical decision making and communication with families. The recognition of impending death is also an opportunity to encourage family members to notify individuals close to the patient who may want an opportunity to “say goodbye.”  In the final hours of life, care should be directed toward the patient and the patient’s loved ones.  In addition to continuing a careful and thoughtful approach to any symptoms a patient is experiencing, preparing family and friends for a patient’s death is critical.  Preparations include the following: For more information, see the section. Encouraging family members who desire to “do something” to participate in the care of the patient (e.g., moistening the mouth) may be helpful. In the final days to hours of life, patients often have limited, transitory moments of lucidity.  Family members should be prepared for this and educated that this is a natural aspect of the dying process and not necessarily a result of medications being administered for symptoms or a sign that the patient is doing better than predicted. Despite their limited ability to interact, patients may be aware of the presence of others; thus, loved ones can be encouraged to speak to the patient as if he or she can hear them. Educating family members about certain signs is critical. In the final hours of life, patients often experience a decreased desire to eat or drink, as evidenced by clenched teeth or turning from offered food and fluids. This behavior may be difficult for family members to accept because of the meaning of food in our society and the inference that the patient is “starving.” Family members should be advised that forcing food or fluids can lead to aspiration. Reframing will include teaching the family to provide ice chips or a moistened oral applicator to keep a patient’s mouth and lips moist. Finally, the death rattle is particularly distressing to family members. It is important to assure family members that death rattle is a natural phenomenon and to pay careful attention to repositioning the patient and explain why tracheal suctioning is not warranted.[ ] For more information, see the section. For patients who die in the hospital, clinicians need to be prepared to inquire about the family’s desire for an autopsy, offering reassurance that the body will be treated with respect and that open-casket services are still possible, if desired. Health care professionals, preferably in consultation with a chaplain or religious leader designated by the patient and/or family,  need to explore with families any fears associated with the time of death and any cultural or religious rituals that may be important to them. Such rituals might include placement of the body (e.g., the head of the bed facing Mecca for an Islamic patient) or having only same-sex caregivers or family members wash the body (as practiced in many orthodox religions).  When death occurs, expressions of grief by those at the bedside vary greatly, dictated in part by culture and in part by their preparation for the death. Chaplains are to be consulted as early as possible if the family accepts this assistance. Health care providers can offer to assist families in contacting loved ones and making other arrangements, including contacting a funeral home. For more information, see . The available evidence provides some general description of frequency of symptoms in the final months to weeks of  the end of life (EOL). However, when the results of published studies of symptoms experienced by patients with advanced cancer are being interpreted or compared, the following methodological issues need to be considered:[ ] Results of one of the larger and more comprehensive studies of symptoms in ambulatory patients with advanced cancer have been reported.[ ] Ambulatory patients with advanced cancer were included in the study if they had completed at least one Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) in the 6 months before death. The ESAS is a patient-completed measure of the severity of the following nine symptoms: Analysis of the changes in the mean symptom intensity of 10,752 patients (and involving 56,759 assessments) over time revealed two patterns:[ ] In terms of symptoms closer to the EOL, a prospective study documented the symptom profile in the last week of life among 203 cancer patients who died in acute palliative care units.[ ][ ] The proportion of patients able to communicate decreased from 80% to 39% over the last 7 days of life.  ESAS anorexia, drowsiness, fatigue, poor well-being, and dyspnea increased in intensity closer to death. In contrast, ESAS depression decreased over time. Dysphagia of solids and liquids and urinary incontinence were also present in an increasing proportion of patients in the last few days of life.  Less common but equally troubling symptoms that may occur in the final hours include death rattle and hemorrhage. The following sections summarize some of the common symptoms and potential approaches to ameliorating those symptoms, based on available evidence. A final note of caution is warranted. Symptoms often cluster, and the presence of a symptom should prompt consideration of other symptoms to avoid inadvertently worsening other symptoms in the cluster. For example, a systematic review of observational studies concluded that there were four common clusters of symptoms (anxiety-depression, nausea-vomiting, nausea-appetite loss, and fatigue-dyspnea-drowsiness-pain).[ ] Terminal delirium occurs before death in 50% to 90% of patients.[ ] Most patients have hypoactive delirium, with a decreased level of consciousness. Agitation, hallucinations, and restlessness may occur in a small proportion of patients with hyperactive and/or mixed delirium. Delirium is associated with  shorter survival and complicates symptom assessment, communication, and decision making. Furthermore, it can be extremely distressing to caregivers and health professionals.[ - ] Risk factors associated with terminal delirium include the following:[ ] Safety measures include protecting patients from accidents or self-injury while they are restless or agitated. The use of restraints should be minimized. Reorientation strategies are of little use during the final hours of life. Education and support for families witnessing a loved one’s delirium are warranted. There are few randomized controlled trials on the management of delirium in patients with terminal or irreversible delirium.[ ] Care of the patient with delirium can include stopping unnecessary medications, reversing metabolic abnormalities (if consistent with the goals of care), treating the symptoms of delirium, and providing a safe environment. Agents known to cause delirium include: In a small, open-label, prospective trial of 20 cancer patients who developed delirium while being treated with morphine, rotation to fentanyl reduced delirium and improved pain control in 18 patients.[ ][ ] The onset of effect and non-oral modes of delivery are considered when an agent is being selected to treat delirium at the EOL. Agents that can be used to manage delirium  include haloperidol, 1 mg to 4 mg orally, intravenously (IV), or subcutaneously.[ ] The dose is usually repeated every 4 to 6 hours but in severe cases can be administered every hour. Chlorpromazine can be used, but IV administration can lead to severe hypotension; therefore, it should be used cautiously.[ ] Other agents that may be effective include olanzapine, 2.5 mg to 20 mg orally at night (available in an orally disintegrating tablet for patients who cannot swallow);[ ][ ] quetiapine;[ ] and risperidone (0.5–2 mg).[ ] While no randomized clinical trial demonstrates superiority of any agent over haloperidol, small (underpowered) studies suggest that olanzapine may be comparable to haloperidol. In addition, a small, double-blind, randomized trial at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center compared the relative sedating effects of scheduled haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and a combination of the two for advanced-cancer patients with agitated delirium.[ ] The investigators screened 998 patients from the palliative and supportive care unit and randomly assigned 68 patients who met the inclusion criteria for having agitated delirium refractory to scheduled haloperidol 1 to 8 mg/day to three intervention groups: haloperidol 2 mg every 4 hours, chlorpromazine 25 mg every 4 hours, or haloperidol 1 mg combined with chlorpromazine 12.5 mg every 4 hours. Rescue doses equivalent to the standing dose were allowed every 1 hour as needed and once at protocol initiation, with the goal of producing sedation with a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score of 0 to –2. Dose escalations and rescue doses were allowed for persistent symptoms. Of the 68 randomized patients, 45 patients were treated and monitored until death or discharge. Patients in all three groups demonstrated clinically significant decreases in RASS scores within 30 minutes and remained sedated at 24 hours. No statistically significant difference in sedation levels was observed between the three protocols. However, the chlorpromazine group was less likely to develop breakthrough restlessness requiring rescue doses or baseline dosing increases. The most common adverse event was hypotension, which was seen in 40% of patients in the haloperidol group, 31% of those in the chlorpromazine group, and 21% of those in the combination group.[ ] One patient in the combination group discontinued therapy because of akathisia. The study was limited by a small sample size and the lack of a placebo group. Although all three interventions were effective at controlling agitation, it is worth noting that they controlled agitation via significant sedation, which may not be desired by all patients and/or their families. Although benzodiazepines (such as lorazepam) or antidopaminergic medications could exacerbate delirium, they may be useful  for the treatment of hyperactive delirium that is not controlled by  other supportive measures. In intractable cases of delirium, palliative sedation may be warranted. A randomized controlled trial compared the effect of lorazepam versus placebo as an adjunctive to haloperidol on the intensity of agitation in 58 patients with delirium in a palliative care unit.[ ] Patients were eligible for the study if they had a diagnosis of delirium with a history of agitation (hyperactive delirium subtype).  Once enrolled, patients began a regimen of haloperidol 2 mg IV every 4 hours, with 2 mg IV hourly as needed for agitation.  The RASS score was monitored every 2 hours until the score was 2 or higher.  At this threshold, the patient received lorazepam 3 mg  or matching placebo with one additional dose of haloperidol 2 mg. The primary outcome of RASS score reduction was measured 8 hours after  administration of the study drug. Patients in the lorazepam group experienced a statistically significant reduction in RASS score (increased sedation) at 8 hours (–4.1 points for lorazepam/haloperidol vs. –2.3 points for placebo/haloperidol; mean difference, –1.9 points [95% confidence interval, –2.8 to –0.9]; < .001). Lorazepam-treated patients also required significantly lower doses of rescue neuroleptics and, after receiving the study medication, were perceived to be in greater comfort  by caregivers and nurses. No differences in mortality were noted between the treatment arms. Caution should be exercised in the use of this protocol because of the  increased risk of significant sedation.  The reduction in agitation is directly proportional to increased sedation to the point of patients being “minimally responsive to verbal stimulus” or conversion to hypoactive delirium  during the remaining hours of life.[ ] Communication with patients and surrogates to determine goal-concordant care in the setting of terminal or hyperactive delirium is imperative to ensure that sedation is an intended outcome of this protocol in which symptom reduction is the primary intention of the intervention. Intensive evaluation of RASS scores may be challenging for the bedside nurse.  Finally, this study examined a single dose of lorazepam 3 mg; repeat doses were not studied and may accumulate in patients with liver and/or renal dysfunction.[ ] In dying patients, a poorly understood phenomenon that appears to be distinct from delirium is the experience of auditory and/or visual hallucinations that include loved ones who have already died (also known as EOL experience). Although patients may sometimes find these hallucinations comforting, fear of being labeled confused may prevent patients from sharing their experiences with health care professionals.[ ] Family members at the bedside may find these hallucinations disconcerting and will require support and reassurance. Consultation with the patient’s or family’s religious or spiritual advisor or the hospital chaplain is often beneficial. Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms at the EOL and often increases in prevalence and intensity as patients approach the final days of life.[ ] Fatigue at the EOL is multidimensional, and its underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood.[ ] It may be associated with drowsiness, weakness, and sleep disturbance. Scores on the Palliative Performance Scale also decrease rapidly during the last 7 days of life.[ ]  No clinical trials have been conducted in patients with only days of life expectancy.  Methylphenidate may be useful in selected patients with weeks of life expectancy.[ ] For more information, see . Treatment options for dyspnea, defined as difficult, painful breathing or shortness of breath, include opioids, nasal cannula oxygen, fans, raising the head of the bed, noninvasive ventilation, and adjunctive agents. Opioids are often considered the preferred first-line treatment option for dyspnea. However, the evidence supporting this standard is controversial, according to a 2016 Cochrane review that found only “low quality evidence” to support the use of opioids to treat breathlessness. The review’s authors suggest that larger, more rigorous studies are needed to conclusively determine whether opioids are effective for treating dyspnea, and whether they have an impact on quality of life for patients suffering from breathlessness.[ ] The routine use of nasal cannula oxygen for patients without documented hypoxemia is not supported by the available data. One group of investigators  reported a double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing the severity of morning and evening breathlessness as reported by patients who received either supplemental oxygen or room air via nasal cannula.[ ] No differences in the primary outcome of symptomatic relief for refractory dyspnea were found in the 239 subjects enrolled in the trial. There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes such as extreme drowsiness or nasal irritation. Potential criticisms of the study include the trial period being only 7 days and a single numerical scale perhaps inadequately reflecting the palliative benefit of oxygen. A small pilot trial randomly assigned 30 Chinese patients with advanced cancer with unresolved breathlessness to either usual care or fan therapy.[ ] The outcome measures included a self-report measure of breathlessness, respiratory rate, and measured oxygen saturation. The measurements were performed before and after fan therapy for the intervention group. There was a significant improvement in the self-reported scores of the patients in the fan group but not in the scores of controls. There were no changes in respiratory rates or oxygen saturations in either group. Because dyspnea may be related to position-dependent changes in ventilation and perfusion, it may be worthwhile to try to determine whether a change in the patient’s positioning in bed alleviates air hunger. A randomized trial compared noninvasive ventilation (with tight-fitting masks and positive pressure) with supplemental oxygen in a group of advanced-cancer patients in respiratory failure who had chosen to forgo all life support and were receiving palliative care.[ ] Patients had to have significant oxygen needs as measured by the ratio of the inhaled oxygen to the measured partial pressure of oxygen in the blood. Two hundred patients were randomly assigned to treatment. Patients in the noninvasive-ventilation group reported more-rapid improvement in dyspnea and used less palliative morphine in the 48 hours after enrollment. Eleven patients in the noninvasive-ventilation group withdrew because of mask discomfort. It should be noted that all patients were given subcutaneous morphine titrated to relief of dyspnea. Whether patients with less severe respiratory status would benefit is unknown. The generalizability of the intervention is limited by the availability of  equipment for noninvasive ventilation. In addition, while noninvasive ventilation is less intrusive than endotracheal intubation, a clear understanding of the goals of the intervention and whether it will be electively discontinued should be established. Bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics may be considered in select situations, provided the use of these agents are consistent with the patient’s goals of care. Bronchodilators may help patients with evidence of bronchoconstriction on clinical examination. Their use carries a small but definite risk of anxiousness and/or tachycardia. Corticosteroids may also be of benefit but carry a risk of anxiety, insomnia, and hyperglycemia. The treatment of potential respiratory infections with antibiotics likewise calls for a consideration of side effects and risks. The prevalence of pain is between 30% and 75% in the last days of life.[ , ] The assessment of pain may be complicated by delirium. Many patients fear uncontrolled pain during the final days of life, but experience suggests that most patients can obtain pain relief and that very high doses of opioids are rarely indicated.[ ] Indeed, the average intensity of pain often decreases as patients approach the final days.[ ] Some patients, family members, and health care professionals express concern that opioid use may hasten death. Several studies refute the fear of hastened death associated with opioid use. In several surveys of high-dose opioid use in hospice and palliative care settings, no relationship between opioid dose and survival was found.[ - ] The principles of pain management remain similar to those for patients earlier in the disease trajectory, with opioids being the standard option. Because consciousness may diminish during this time and swallowing becomes difficult, practitioners need to anticipate alternatives to the oral route. In one study, as patients approached death, the use of intermittent subcutaneous injections and IV or subcutaneous infusions increased.[ ] Both IV and subcutaneous routes are effective in delivering opioids and other agents in the inpatient or home setting. For patients who do not have a preexisting access port or catheter, intermittent or continuous subcutaneous administration provides a painless and effective route of delivery.[ ] For a more complete review of parenteral administration of opioids and opioid rotation, see . Cough is a relatively common symptom in patients with advanced cancer near the EOL. In one small study, 33% of patients with advanced cancer who were enrolled in hospice and who completed the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale reported cough as a troubling symptom.[ ] This compares to a prevalence of lack of energy (68%), pain (63%), and dyspnea (60%). The treatment of troublesome coughing in patients in the final weeks to days of life is largely empiric, although diagnostic imaging or evaluation may occasionally be of value. In another study of patients with advanced cancer admitted to acute palliative care units, the prevalence of cough ranged from 10% to 30% in the last week of life.[ ] However, simple investigations such as reviewing medications or eliciting a history of symptoms compatible with gastroesophageal reflux disease are warranted because some drugs (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) cause cough, or a prescription for antacids may provide relief. In addition, patients may have comorbid conditions that contribute to coughing. For more information about common causes of cough for which evaluation and targeted intervention may be indicated, see . The cough reflex protects the lungs from noxious materials and clears excess secretions. The reflex is initiated by stimulation of peripheral cough receptors, which are transmitted to the brainstem by the vagus nerve. Activation of the central “cough center” mechanism causes a deep inspiration, followed by expiration against a closed glottis; then the glottis opens, allowing expulsion of the air.[ ] The empiric approach to cough may be organized as follows: As discussed in the section, the use of bronchodilators, corticosteroids, or inhaled steroids is limited to specific indications, given the potential risks and the lack of evidence of benefit outside of specific indications. The prevalence of constipation ranges from 30% to 50% in the last days of life.[ , ] The use of laxatives for patients who are imminently dying may provide limited benefit.   Such patients often have dysphagia and very poor oral intake.  Treatment of constipation in patients with only days of expected survival is guided by symptoms.  If indicated, laxatives may be given rectally (e.g., bisacodyl or enemas). Functional dysphagia and structural dysphagia occur in a large proportion of cancer patients in the last days of life.  Specifically, patients often experience difficulty swallowing both liquids and solids, which is often associated with anorexia and cachexia. In one study of cancer patients, the oral route of opioid administration was continued in 62% of patients at 4 weeks before death, in  43% at 1 week before death, and in 20% at 24 hours before death.[ ]  The clinical implication is that essential medications may need to be administered through other routes, such as IV, subcutaneous, rectal, and transdermal.  Nonessential medications are discontinued. Artificial nutrition is of no known benefit at the EOL and may increase the risk of aspiration and/or infections.  Instead of tube-feeding or ordering nothing by mouth, providing a small amount of food for enjoyment may be reasonable if a patient expresses a desire to eat. For more information, see the  sections on and . Death rattle, also referred to as excessive secretions, occurs when saliva and other fluids accumulate in the oropharynx and upper airways in a patient who is too weak to clear the throat. Rattle does not appear to be distressing for the patient; however, family members may perceive death rattle as indicating the presence of untreated dyspnea. Thus, the family will benefit from learning about the nature of this symptom and that  death rattle is not associated with  dyspnea. Rattle is an indicator of impending death, with an incidence of approximately 50% to 60% in the last days of life and a median onset of 16 to 57 hours before death.[ , , ] Two types of rattle have been identified:[ , ] In one retrospective chart review, rattle was relieved in more than 90% of patients with salivary secretions, while patients with secretions of pulmonary origin were much less likely to respond to treatment.[ ] The results of clinical trials examining various pharmacological agents for the treatment of death rattle have so far been negative.[ ] A small, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial that compared scopolamine to normal saline found no statistical significance.[ ] Another randomized study revealed no difference between atropine and placebo.[ ]  Results of other randomized controlled studies that examined octreotide,[ ] glycopyrrolate,[ ] and hyoscine butylbromide [ ] versus scopolamine were also negative. Despite the lack of clear evidence, pharmacological therapies are used frequently in clinical practice.[ , ]   Among the options described above, glycopyrrolate may be preferred because it is less likely to penetrate the central nervous system and has fewer adverse effects than other antimuscarinic agents, which can worsen delirium.  Glycopyrrolate  is available parenterally and in oral tablet form. Doses typically range from 1 mg to 2 mg orally or 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg IV or subcutaneously every 4 hours, or by continuous IV infusion at a rate of 0.4 mg to 1.2 mg per day. Repositioning is often helpful.  Suctioning of excessive secretions may be considered for some patients, although this may elicit the gag reflex and be counterproductive. Given the limited efficacy of pharmacological interventions for death rattle, clinicians should consider factors that can help prevent it.   In one secondary analysis of an observational study of patients who were dying of abdominal malignancies, audible death rattle was correlated with the volume of IV hydration administered.  Patients who received more than 500 mL of IV fluid in the week before death had a significantly higher risk of developing death rattle in the 48 hours before death than patients who received less than 500 mL of IV fluid.  Along with patient wishes and concomitant symptoms, clinicians should consider limiting IV hydration in the final days before death.[ ][ ] For more information, see the section. Health care professionals need to monitor patients for opioid-induced neurotoxicity, which can cause symptoms such as myoclonus, hallucinations, hyperalgesia, seizures, and confusion, and which may mimic terminal delirium. One retrospective study examined 390 patients with advanced cancer at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center who had been taking opioids for 24 hours or longer and who received palliative care consultations. The study suggested that 15% of these patients developed at least one symptom of opioid-induced neurotoxicity, the most common of which was delirium (47%).[ ] When opioid-induced neurotoxicity is suspected, opioid rotation may be considered.[ ] Myoclonus is defined as sudden and involuntary movements caused by focal or generalized muscle contractions. The duration of contractions is brief and may be described as shocklike. There are many potential causes of myoclonus, most of which probably stem from the metabolic derangements anticipated as life ends. Medications, particularly opioids, are another potential etiology. The reported prevalence of opioid-induced myoclonus ranges greatly, from 2.7% to 87%.[ ] When opioids are implicated in the development of myoclonus, rotation to a different opioid is the primary treatment. In patients with rapidly impending death, the health care provider may choose to treat the myoclonus rather than make changes in opioids during the final hours. Benzodiazepines, including clonazepam, diazepam, and midazolam, have been recommended.[ - ] The anticonvulsant gabapentin has been reported to be effective in relieving opioid-induced myoclonus,[ ] although other reports implicate gabapentin as a cause of myoclonus.[ , ][ ]  In one small randomized study, hydration was found to reduce myoclonus.[ ][ ] There are no reliable data on the frequency of fever. A prospective study of 232 adults with terminal cancer admitted to a hospice and palliative care unit in Taiwan indicated that fever was uncommon and of moderate severity (mean score, 0.37 on a scale of 1–3).[ ] There was no increase in fever in the 2 days immediately preceding death. In addition to considering diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic intervention, the clinician needs to carefully assess whether the patient is distressed or negatively affected by the fever. There are no data showing that fever materially affects the quality of the experience of the dying person. While infection may cause a fever, other etiologies such as medications or the underlying cancer are to  be strongly considered. While the main objective in the decision to use antimicrobials is to treat clinically suspected infections in patients who are receiving palliative or hospice care,[ - ][ ] subsequent information suggests that the risks of using empiric antibiotics do not appear justified by the possible benefits for people near death.[ ] Hemorrhage is an uncommon (6%–14%) yet extremely distressing event, especially when it is sudden and catastrophic.[ ] Patients with bone marrow failure or liver failure are susceptible to bleeding caused by lack of adequate platelets or coagulation factors; patients with advanced cancer, especially head and neck cancers, experience bleeding caused by fungating wounds or damage to vascular structures from tumor growth, surgery, or radiation. Patients may also experience gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcers, progressive tumor growth, or chemotherapy-induced mucositis. The management of catastrophic bleeding may include identification of patients who are at risk of catastrophic bleeding and careful communication about risk and potential management strategies. However, two qualitative interview studies of clinicians whose patients experienced catastrophic bleeding at the EOL suggest that it is often impossible to anticipate bleeding and that a proactive approach may cause patients and families undue distress.[ , ] Furthermore, the lack of evidence that catastrophic bleeding can be prevented with medical interventions such as transfusions needs to be taken into account in discussions with patients about the risks of bleeding. Another strategy is to prepare to administer anxiolytics or sedatives to patients who experience catastrophic bleeding, between the start of the bleeding and death. However, there is little evidence supporting the effectiveness of this approach;[ , ] the experience of clinicians is often that patients become unconscious before the drugs can be administered, and the focus on medications may distract from providing  patients and families with reassurance that suffering is unlikely. Nevertheless, the availability of benzodiazepines for rapid sedation of patients who experience catastrophic bleeding may provide some reassurance for family caregivers. Additionally, having dark towels available to camouflage the blood can reduce distress experienced by loved ones who are present at the time of hemorrhage. After the death of a patient from a catastrophic hemorrhage, family members and team members are encouraged to verbalize their emotions regarding the experience, and their questions need to be answered. In rare situations, EOL symptoms may be refractory to all of the treatments described above. In such cases, palliative sedation may be indicated, using benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or neuroleptics. Refractory dyspnea is the second most common indication for palliative sedation, after agitated delirium.[ ] For more information, see the section. A significant proportion (approximately 30%) of patients with advanced cancer continue to receive chemotherapy toward the end of life (EOL), including a small number (2%–5%) who receive their last dose of chemotherapy within 14 days of death.[ - ]  These numbers may be even higher in certain demographic populations. One small study of African American patients with lung cancer showed that 27% received chemotherapy within the last 30 days of life, and 17.6% did so within the last 14 days.[ ][ ] Chemotherapy administered until  the EOL is associated with significant adverse effects, resulting in prolonged hospitalization or increased likelihood of dying in an  intensive care unit (ICU).[ , ] Thus, the lack of definite or meaningful improvement in survival leads many clinicians to advise patients to discontinue chemotherapy on the basis of an increasingly unfavorable ratio of benefit to risk. Ultimately, the decision to initiate, continue, or forgo chemotherapy should be made collaboratively and is ideally consistent with the expected risks and benefits of treatment within the context of the patient's goals of care. However, the following reasons independent of the risks and benefits may lead a patient to prefer chemotherapy and are potentially worth exploring: The era of personalized medicine has altered this risk/benefit ratio for certain patients. Genomic tumor testing is indicated for multiple tumor types. Finding actionable mutations for targeted therapy is vital for many patients with metastatic cancers. A 2021 study showed that patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had , , or mutations and received targeted therapy had better quality-of-life and symptom scores over time, compared with patients without targetable mutations.[ ][ ] The study also indicated that the patients who received targeted therapy were more likely to receive cancer-directed therapy in the last 2 weeks of life and to die in the hospital. These patients were also more likely to report that they “rarely or never” discussed their prognosis with their oncologist.[ ][ ] As the authors noted, these findings raise concerns that patients receiving targeted therapy may have poorer prognostic awareness and therefore fewer opportunities to prepare for the EOL. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the standard of care for multiple cancers. These drugs are increasingly used in older patients and those with poorer performance status for whom traditional chemotherapy may no longer be appropriate, though they may still be associated with unwanted side effects.   Predictive factors for whether any given patient will have a significant response to these newer agents are often unclear, making prognostication challenging.[ , ]  This  uncertainty may lead to questions about when systemic treatment should be stopped and when supportive care only and/or hospice care should begin. Data on  immune checkpoint inhibitor use at the EOL are limited. However, three single-institution, retrospective studies showed that immunotherapy use in the last 30 days of life was associated with lower rates of hospice enrollment, a higher risk of dying in the hospital, greater risk of financial toxicity, and minimal clinical benefits.[ , , ] A 2023 retrospective observational study involved 57,791 patients from 150 different practices represented in the nationwide database of Flatiron Health deidentified electronic health records. The study showed that White patients were more likely than Black patients to receive immunotherapy in the last month of life (30-day adjusted odds ratio [OR] for Black vs. White patients, 0.86 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.98] and 14-day adjusted OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75–0.99]). Additionally, patients with commercial insurance were more likely to receive immunotherapy at EOL than patients with public insurance (30-day adjusted OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.57–0.90] and 14-day adjusted OR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.48–0.96]). The authors also observed a nonsignificant association between treatment in community settings, as opposed to academic centers, and risk of receiving systemic treatments (either immunotherapy or chemotherapy) within 30 days of EOL. Because of these constellation of findings, the authors hypothesized that payment incentives, reimbursement models, and structural inequities may be at play in EOL care.[ ] Patients with advanced cancer who receive hospice care appear to experience better psychological adjustment, fewer burdensome symptoms, increased satisfaction, improved communication, and better deaths without hastening death.[ - ] The rate of hospice enrollment for people with cancer has increased in recent years; however, this increase is tempered by a reduction in the average length of hospice stay. Because of the association of longer hospice stays with caregivers’ perceptions of improved quality of care and increased satisfaction with care, the latter finding is especially concerning.[ , ] Multiple patient demographic factors (e.g., younger age, married status, female gender, White race, greater affluence, and geographic region) are associated with increased hospice enrollment. In one study, however, physician characteristics were more important than patient characteristics in determining hospice enrollment.[ ] This may reflect the observation that patients concede more control to oncologists over time, especially if  treatment decisions involve noncurative chemotherapy for metastatic cancer.[ ] There are many potential barriers to timely hospice enrollment. Forgoing disease-directed therapy is one of the barriers cited by patients, caregivers, physicians, and hospice services.  The , a novel Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) pilot program, is evaluating a new supportive care model that allows beneficiaries to receive supportive care from selected hospice providers, alongside therapy directed toward their terminal condition.  This 5-year project enrolled its first cohort of patients in January 2016 and the second cohort in January 2018.  Reduced use of resource-intensive services, improved quality of EOL care, and more days spent at home were some of the benefits reported from this study. The purpose of this section is to provide the oncology clinician with insights into the decision to enroll in hospice, and to encourage a full discussion of hospice as an important EOL option for patients with advanced cancer. The related study [ ] provides  potential strategies to address some of the patient-level barriers. Barriers are summarized in the following subsections on the basis of whether they arise predominantly from the perspective of the , , , or , including eligibility criteria for enrollment. Patients often express a sense that it would be premature to enroll in hospice, that enrolling in hospice means giving up, or that enrolling in hospice would disrupt their relationship with their oncologist.[ ] The difficulty in recognizing  when to enroll in hospice may explain the observations that the trend in increasing hospice utilization has not led to a reduction in intensive treatment, including admission to ICUs at the EOL.[ , ] Patients may agree to enroll in hospice in the final days of life only after aggressive medical treatments have clearly failed. Given the likely benefit of longer times in hospice care, patient-level predictors of short hospice stays may be particularly relevant. One group of investigators conducted a retrospective cohort study of 64,264 adults with cancer admitted to hospice.[ ] Sixteen percent stayed 3 days or fewer, with a range of 11.4% to 24.5% among the 12 participating hospices. The following factors (and ORs) were independently associated with short hospice stays in multivariable analysis: A diagnosis of depression may also affect how likely patients are to enroll in hospice. A 2018 retrospective cohort study of 13,827 patients with NSCLC drew data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)–Medicare database to examine the association between depression and hospice utilization. The authors found that NSCLC patients with precancer depression (depression recorded during the 3–24 months before cancer diagnosis) and patients with diagnosis-time depression (depression recorded between 3 months before and 30 days after cancer diagnosis) were more likely to enroll in hospice than were NSCLC patients with no recorded depression diagnosis (subhazard ratio [SHR], 1.19 and 1.16, respectively).[ ] Patients with precancer depression were also more likely to spend extended periods (≥90 days) in hospice care (adjusted OR, 1.29). In contrast, patients with postdiagnosis depression (diagnosed >30 days after NSCLC diagnosis) were less likely to enroll in hospice (SHR, 0.80) than were NSCLC patients without depression.[ ] The authors hypothesized that patients with precancer depression may be more likely to receive early hospice referrals, especially given previously established links between depression and high symptom burden in patients with advanced cancer. They also suggested that enhanced screening for depression in patients with cancer may impact hospice enrollment and quality of care provided at the EOL.[ ] In a survey of 53 caregivers of patients who died of lung cancer while in hospice, 35% of caregivers felt that patients should have received hospice care sooner. The highest rates of agreement with potential reasons for deferring hospice enrollment were for the following three survey items:[ ] Only 22% of caregivers agreed that the family member delayed enrollment because enrolling in hospice meant giving up hope. In a survey of 273 physicians, 65% agreed that a barrier to hospice enrollment was the patient preference for simultaneous anticancer treatment and hospice care. Almost one-half of physicians believed (incorrectly) that patients must have do-not-resuscitate and do-not-intubate orders in place to qualify for hospice.[ ] The lack of timely discussions  with oncologists or other physicians about hospice care and its benefits remains a potentially remediable barrier to the timing of referral to hospice.[ - ] The Medicare hospice benefit requires that physicians certify patients’ life expectancies that are shorter  than 6 months and that patients forgo curative treatments. Patients who are enrolled in hospice receive all care related to their terminal illnesses through  hospice, although most hospice reimbursement comes  through a fixed per diem. Thus, hospices may have additional enrollment criteria. One group of investigators conducted a national survey of 591 hospices that revealed 78% of hospices had at least one policy that could restrict enrollment.[ ] Sixty-one percent of patients could not be receiving chemotherapy,  55% could not be receiving total parenteral nutrition, and 40% could not be receiving transfusions. Only 8% restricted enrollment of patients receiving tube feedings. The  percentage of hospices without restrictive enrollment practices varied by geographic region, from a low of 14% in the East/West South Central region to a high of 33% in the South Atlantic region. A further challenge related to hospice enrollment is that the willingness to forgo chemotherapy does not identify patients who have a high perceived need for hospice care. Investigators conducted conjoint interviews of 300 patients with cancer and 171 family caregivers to determine the perceived need for five core hospice services (visiting nurse, chaplain, counselor, home health aide, and respite care).[ ] Patients willing to forgo chemotherapy did not have different levels of perceived needs. In a multivariable model, the following patient factors predicted a greater perceived need for hospice services: The following family factors predicted a greater perceived need for hospice services: Many patients with advanced-stage cancer express a desire to die at home,[ ] but many will die in a  hospital or other facility. Patients who die at home, however, appear to have a better quality of life than do patients who die in a hospital or ICU, and their bereaved caregivers experience less difficulty adjusting.[ ] Dying at home is also associated with better symptom control and preparedness for death and with caregivers’ perceptions of a higher-quality death.[ ] Enrollment in hospice increases the likelihood of dying at home, but careful attention needs to be paid to caregiver support and symptom control. One group of investigators analyzed a cohort of 5,837 hospice patients with terminal cancer for whom the patient’s preference for dying at home was determined.[ ] Of the 5,837 patients, 4,336 (79%) preferred to die at home. Patients who preferred to die at home were more likely to do so (56% vs. 37%; OR, 2.21). In multivariable analysis, the following factors (with percentages and ORs) were correlated with a greater likelihood of dying at home: Conversely, patients were less likely to die at home (OR, <1) if there was: However, not all patients prefer to die at home, e.g., patients who are unmarried, non-White, and older.[ ] Thus, the oncology clinician strives to facilitate a discussion about preferred place of death and a plan to overcome potential barriers to dying at the patient’s preferred site. Approximately one-third to one-half of pediatric patients who die of cancer die in a hospital.[ , ] Dying in an inpatient setting has been associated with more intensive and invasive interventions in the last month of life for pediatric cancer patients and adverse psychosocial outcomes for caregivers.[ ] For example, parents of children who die in the hospital experience more depression, anxiety, and complicated grief than do parents of children who die outside of the hospital.[ ] A retrospective analysis of 321 pediatric cancer patients who died while enrolled in the palliative care service at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital suggests that the following factors (with ORs) were associated with a higher likelihood of dying in the pediatric ICU:[ ] A separate retrospective analysis of 121 pediatric and young adult patients in the United Kingdom who died between 2012 and 2016 showed that 72% of patients who identified a preferred location of death achieved this wish. They included all patients who wanted to die at the hospital or under hospice care. In contrast, only 58% of patients who wished to die at home achieved this desire, which was often complicated by rapid deterioration. Treatment that focused on supportive care, rather than active chemotherapy or radiation therapy, increased the odds of achieving the patient's preferred place of death (OR, 3.19; = .04).[ ][ ] Pediatric care providers may want to consider the factors listed above to identify patients at higher risk of dying in an intensive inpatient setting, and  to initiate early conversations about goals of care and preferred place of death.[ ] A necessary goal of high-quality end-of-life (EOL) care is the alleviation of distressing symptoms that can lead to suffering. An important strategy to achieve that goal is to avoid or reduce medical interventions of limited effectiveness and high burden to the patients. There is, however, a great deal of confusion, anxiety, and miscommunication around the question of whether to utilize potentially life-sustaining treatments (LSTs) such as mechanical ventilation, total parenteral nutrition, and dialysis in the final weeks or days of life.  To ensure that the best interests of the patient—as communicated by the patient, family, or surrogate decision maker—determine the decisions about LSTs, discussions can be organized around the following questions: Medicine is a moral enterprise. The decisions clinicians make are often highly subjective and value laden but seem less so because, equally often, there is a shared sense of benefit, harm, and what is most highly valued. Occasionally, disagreements arise or a provider is uncertain about what is ethically permissible. For example, an oncologist may favor the discontinuation or avoidance of LST, given the lack of evidence of benefit or the possibility of harm—including increasing the suffering of the dying person by prolonging the dying process—or based on concerns that LST interferes with the patient accepting that life is ending and finding peace in the final days. A provider also may be uncertain about whether withdrawing treatment is equivalent to causing the patient’s death. Conversely, the patient may continue to request LST on the basis of personal beliefs and a preference for potential prolonged life, independent of the oncologist’s clinical risk-benefit analysis. Individual values inform the moral landscape of the practice of medicine. The potential conflicts described above are opportunities to refine clinicians’ understanding of their beliefs and values and to communicate their moral reasoning to each other as a sign of integrity and respect.[ ]  As clinicians struggle to communicate their reasons for recommendations or actions, the following three questions may serve as a framework:[ ] In the event of conflict, an ethics consult may be necessary to identify the sources of disagreement and potential solutions, although frameworks have been proposed to guide the clinician.[ ] The following paragraphs summarize information relevant to the first two questions. Respect for patient autonomy is an essential element of the relationship between oncology clinician and patient. Respect for autonomy encourages clinicians to elicit patients’ values, goals of care, and preferences and then seek to provide treatment or care recommendations consistent with patient preferences.[ ] Autonomy is primarily a negative right to be free from the interference of others or, in health care, to refuse a recommended treatment or intervention.[ ] On the basis of potential harm to others or deliberate harm to themselves, there are limits to what patients can expect in terms of their requests. More controversial limits are imposed when oncology clinicians feel they are asked to violate their ethical integrity or when the medical effectiveness of a treatment does not justify the burden.[ ] Perceived conflicts about the issue of patient autonomy may be avoided by recalling that promoting patient autonomy is not only about treatments administered but also about discussions with the patient.[ ] It is acceptable for oncology clinicians to share the basis for their recommendations, including concerns such as clinician-perceived futility.[ , ] The following criteria to consider forgoing a potential LST are not absolute and remain a topic of discussion and debate; however, they offer a frame of reference for deliberation: Awareness of the importance of religious beliefs and spiritual concerns within medical care has increased substantially over the last decade. National consensus guidelines, published in 2018, recommended the following:[ ] An interprofessional approach is recommended: medical personnel, including physicians, nurses, and other professionals such as social workers and psychologists, are trained to address these issues and link with chaplains, as available, to evaluate and engage patients. A survey of nurses and physicians revealed that most nurses (74%) and physicians (60%) desire to provide spiritual care, which was defined as “care that supports a patient’s spiritual health.”[ ] The more commonly cited barriers associated with the estimated amount of spiritual care provided to patients included inadequate training and the belief that providing spiritual care 
is not part of the medical professional’s role. Most nurses (79%) desired training in spiritual care; fewer physicians (51%) did. Evidence strongly supports that most cancer patients desire dialogue about these issues with their physicians, other staff as appropriate, and hospital chaplains, if indicated.[ ] About one-half of patients acknowledge that they are not receiving such support from a religious community, either because they are not involved in one or because they do not perceive their community as supportive.[ ] Regardless of such support, patients may report substantial spiritual distress at the EOL, ranging from as few as 10% or 15% of patients to as many as 60%.[ ] Distress may range from anger at God, to a feeling of unworthiness, to lack of meaning. Such distress, if not addressed, may complicate EOL decisions and increase depression. Finally, it has been shown that addressing religious and spiritual concerns earlier in the terminal-care process substantially decreases the likelihood that patients will request aggressive EOL measures.[ ] In contrast, patients who have received strong support from their own religious communities alone are less likely to enter hospice and more likely to seek aggressive EOL care.[ ] It has also been shown that providing more comprehensive palliative care increases spiritual well-being as the EOL approaches.[ ] For more information, see . The potential indications for artificial hydration in the final weeks or days of life may be broadly defined by the underlying goal of either temporarily reversing or halting clinical deterioration or improving the comfort of the dying patient.[ ] Although artificial hydration may be provided through enteral routes (e.g., nasogastric tubes or percutaneous gastrostomy tubes), the more common route is parenteral, either  IV  by catheter or subcutaneously through a needle (hypodermoclysis). Although uncontrolled experience suggested several advantages to artificial hydration in patients with advanced cancer, a well-designed, randomized trial of 129 patients enrolled in home hospice demonstrated no benefit in   parenteral hydration (1 L of normal saline infused subcutaneously over 4 hours) compared with placebo (100 mL of normal saline infused subcutaneously over 4 hours).[ ]  There were no differences in survival, symptoms, quality of life, or delirium. A prospective evaluation of the outcomes of 161 patients with advanced-stage abdominal cancers who received parenteral hydration in accordance with Japanese national guidelines near the EOL suggests there is little harm or benefit in  hydration.[ ] The median survival of the cohort was 20 days (range, 1–84 days); the mean volume of parenteral hydration was 912 ± 495 mL/day. There were no significant trends in global quality of life, discomfort, or physical symptoms for ill or good; signs of fluid retention were common but not exacerbated. However, patients expressed a high level of satisfaction with hydration and felt it was beneficial. The guidelines specify that patients with signs of volume overload should receive less than 1 L of hydration per day. When the investigators stratified patients into two groups—those who received at least 1 L of parenteral hydration per day and those who received less than 1 L per day—the prevalence of bronchial secretions was higher and hyperactive delirium was lower in the patients who received more than 1 L.[ ] Any discussion about the risks or benefits of artificial hydration must include a consideration of patient and family perspectives.[ ] Requests for artificial hydration or the desire for discussions about the role of artificial hydration seem to be driven by quality-of-life considerations as much as considerations for life prolongation.[ ]  Families may be helped with this decision when clinicians explain that use of artificial hydration in patients with cancer at the EOL has not been shown to help patients live longer or improve quality of life.  Additionally, families can be educated about good mouth care and provision of sips of water to alleviate thirst.[ ] The oncology clinician needs to approach these conversations with an open mind, recognizing that the harm caused by artificial hydration may be minimal relative to the perceived benefit, which includes reducing fatigue and increasing alertness.[ ] The following discussion excludes patients for whom artificial nutrition may facilitate further anticancer treatment or for whom bowel obstruction is the main manifestation of their advanced cancer and for whom enteral or total parenteral nutrition may be of value.[ ] Furthermore, artificial nutrition as a supplement may benefit the patient with advanced cancer who has a good performance status, a supportive home environment, and an anticipated survival longer than 3 months.[ , ] The decisions about whether to provide artificial nutrition to the dying patient are similar to the decisions regarding artificial hydration. The American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM) recommends that individual clinical situations be assessed using clinical judgment and skill to determine when artificial nutrition is appropriate. Recognizing that the primary intention of nutrition is to benefit the patient, AAHPM concludes that withholding artificial nutrition near the EOL may be appropriate medical care if the risks outweigh the possible benefit to the patient.[ ] Food should be offered to patients consistent with their desires and ability to swallow. The benefit of providing artificial nutrition in the final days to weeks of life, however, is less clear. One study has concluded that artificial nutrition—specifically, parenteral nutrition—neither influenced the outcome nor improved the quality of life in terminally ill patients.[ ] Providing artificial nutrition to patients at the EOL is a medical intervention and requires establishing enteral or parenteral access. Considerations of financial cost, burden to patient and family of additional hospitalizations and medical procedures, and all potential complications must be weighed against any potential benefit derived from artificial nutrition support. In discussions with patients, the oncology clinician needs to recognize that  the patient perception of benefit is worth exploring; as a compromise or acknowledgment of respect for the patient’s perspective, a time-limited trial may be warranted.[ ] The administration of anti-infectives, primarily antibiotics, in the last days of life is common, with antibiotic use reported in patients in the last week of life at rates ranging from 27% to 78%.[ - ][ ]  Because of wide heterogeneity in the measurement of antibiotic use, assessment of symptom response, and lack of comparisons between patients receiving antimicrobials with those not receiving them, the benefit of antimicrobials is hard to define.[ ] One retrospective study of 133 patients in a palliative care inpatient unit found that 68% received antimicrobials in their last 14 days of life, but the indication was documented in only 12% of these patients. White patients were more likely to receive antimicrobials than patients of other racial and ethnic backgrounds. Documented symptoms, including pain, dyspnea, fever, lethargy, and altered mental state, did not differ in the group that received antibiotics, compared with the patients who did not. However, the study’s conclusions were limited by the fact that it relied on retrospective chart review, and investigators did not use tools to measure and compare symptom severity in both groups.[ ][ ] An additional setting in which antimicrobial use may be warranted is that of contagious public health risks such as tuberculosis.[ ]  There is also concern that the continued use of antimicrobials in the last week of life may lead to increased risk of developing drug-resistant organisms.[ ] In general, most practitioners agree with the overall focus on patient comfort in the last days of life rather than providing curative therapies with unknown or marginal benefit, despite their ability to provide the therapy.[ , - ] Anemia is common in patients with advanced cancer; thrombocytopenia is less common and typically occurs in patients with progressive hematological malignancies. The decision to transfuse either packed red cells or platelets is based on a careful consideration of the overall goals of care, the imminence of death, and the likely benefit and risks of transfusions. The decision to use blood products is further complicated by the potential scarcity of the resource and the typical need for the patient to receive transfusions in a specialized unit rather than at home. There are no randomized or controlled prospective trials of the indications, safety, or efficacy of transfused products. It should be recognized, however, that many patients will have received transfusions during active disease treatment or periods of supportive care. Such patients may have notions of the importance of transfusions related to how they feel and their life expectancies. Several considerations may be relevant to the decision to transfuse red blood cells: Broadly defined, resuscitation includes all interventions that provide cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic support necessary to maintain and sustain the life of a dying patient. It is important for patients, families, and proxies to understand that choices may be made to specify which supportive measures, if any, are given preceding death and at the time of death. People often believe that there is plenty of time to discuss resuscitation and the surrounding issues; however, many dying patients do not make choices in advance or have not communicated their decisions to their families, proxies, and the health care team. If these issues are unresolved at the time of EOL events, undesired support and resuscitation may result. Studies suggest that this aggressive care is associated with worse patient quality of life and worse adjustment to bereavement  for loved ones.[ , ] Narrowly defined, a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order instructs health care providers that, in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR, including chest compressions and/or ventilations) should not be performed and that natural death be allowed to proceed. DNR orders must be made before cardiac arrest and may be recommended by physicians when CPR is considered medically futile or would be ineffective in returning a patient to life. A DNR order may also be made at the instruction of the patient (or family or proxy) when CPR is not consistent with the goals of care. It is advisable for a patient who has clear thoughts about these issues to initiate conversations with the health care team (or appointed health care agents in the outpatient setting) and to have forms completed as early as possible (i.e., before hospital admission), before the capacity to make such decisions is lost. Although patients with end-stage disease and their families are often uncomfortable bringing up the issues surrounding DNR orders, physicians and nurses can tactfully and respectfully address these issues appropriately and in a timely fashion. Lack of standardization in many institutions may contribute to ineffective and unclear discussions around DNR orders.[ ] Patients with advanced cancer are often unprepared for a decline in health status near the end of life (EOL) and, as a consequence, they are admitted to the hospital for more aggressive treatments. This complicates  EOL decision making because the treatments may prolong life, or at least are perceived as accomplishing that goal. At that point, patients or families may express ambivalence or be reluctant to withdraw treatments rather than withhold them. One strategy to explore is preventing further escalation of care. The goal of this strategy is to provide a bridge between full life-sustaining treatment (LST) and comfort care, in which the goal is a good death.  It has been suggested that clinicians may encourage no escalation of care because of concerns that the intensive medical treatments will prevent death, and therefore the patient will have missed the “opportunity to die.”[ ] One study [ ] described the care of 310 patients who died in the intensive care unit (ICU) (not all of whom had cancer). For 95 patients (30%), there was a decision not to escalate care. The average time from ICU admission to deciding not to escalate care was 6 days (range, 0–37), and the average time to death was 0.8 days (range, 0–5). The interventions most likely to be withheld were dialysis, vasopressors, and blood transfusions. Fifty-five percent of the patients eventually had all life support withdrawn. The transition to comfort care did not occur before death for  the other decedents for the following reasons: waiting for family to arrive, change of family opinion, or waiting for an ethics consultation. Conversely, some situations may warrant exploring with the patient and/or family a time-limited trial of intensive medical treatments. The patient or surrogates may choose to withdraw all LST if there is no improvement during the limited trial.[ ] From an ethical standpoint, withdrawing treatment is equivalent to withholding such treatment. Both actions are justified for unwarranted or unwanted intensive care. Two methods of withdrawal have been described: immediate extubation and terminal weaning.[ ] Immediate extubation includes providing parenteral opioids for analgesia and sedating agents such as midazolam, suctioning to remove excess secretions, setting the ventilator to “no assist” and turning off all alarms, and deflating the cuff and removing the endotracheal tube. Gentle suctioning of the oral cavity may be necessary, but aggressive and deep suctioning should be avoided. In some cases, patients may appear to be in significant distress. Analgesics and sedatives may be provided, even if the patient is comatose. Family members and others who are present should be warned that some movements may occur after extubation, even in patients who have no brain activity. Such movements are probably caused by hypoxia and may include gasping, moving extremities, or sitting up in bed.[ ] Immediate extubation is generally chosen when a patient has lost brain function, when a patient is comatose and unlikely to experience any suffering, or when a patient prefers a more rapid procedure. Terminal weaning entails a more gradual process. Ventilator rate, oxygen levels, and positive end-expiratory pressure are decreased gradually over a period of 30 minutes to a few hours. A patient who survives may be placed on a T-piece; this may be left in place, or extubation may proceed. There is some evidence that the gradual process in a patient who may experience distress allows clinicians to assess pain and dyspnea and to modify the sedative and analgesic regimen accordingly.[ ] In a study of 31 patients undergoing terminal weaning, most patients remained comfortable, as assessed by a variety of physiological measures, when low doses of opioids and benzodiazepines were administered. The average time to death in this study was 24 hours, although two patients survived to be discharged to hospice.[ ] Paralytic agents have no analgesic or sedative effects, and they can mask patient discomfort. These neuromuscular blockers need to be discontinued before extubation. Guidelines suggest that these agents should never be introduced when the ventilator is being withdrawn; in general, when patients have been receiving paralytic agents, these agents need to be withdrawn before extubation. The advantage of withdrawal of the neuromuscular blocker is the resultant ability of the health care provider to better assess the patient’s comfort level and to allow possible interaction between the patient and loved ones. One notable exception to withdrawal of the paralytic agent is when death is expected to be rapid after the removal of the ventilator and when waiting for the drug to reverse might place an unreasonable burden on the patient and family.[ ] Regardless of the technique employed, the patient and setting must be prepared. Monitors and alarms are turned off, and life-prolonging interventions such as antibiotics and transfusions need to be discontinued. Family members should be given sufficient time to prepare, including planning for the presence of all loved ones who wish to be in attendance. They need to be given information about what to expect during the process; some may elect to remain out of the room during extubation. Chaplains or social workers may be called to provide support to the family. Published in 2013, a prospective observational study of 64 patients who died of cancer serially assessed symptoms, symptom intensity, and whether symptoms were unbearable.[ ] Weakness was the most prevalent  symptom (93% of patients). Fifty-one percent of patients rated their weakness as high intensity; of these, 84% rated their suffering as unbearable. Pain, loss of control over one’s life, and fear of future suffering were unbearable when symptom intensity was high. Caregiver suffering is a complex construct that refers to severe distress in caregivers’ physical, psychosocial, and spiritual well-being. A number of studies have reported strong associations between patients’ and caregivers’ emotional states. In a systematic review of 19 descriptive studies of caregivers during the palliative, hospice, and bereavement phases, analysis of patient-caregiver dyads found mutuality between the patient’s condition and the caregiver’s response. Caregivers were found to be at increased risk of  physical and psychological burden across studies, with caregiver distress sometimes exceeding that of the patient.[ ] Several studies have categorized caregiver suffering with the use of dyadic analysis. In a qualitative study involving 22 dyadic semistructured interviews, caregivers dealing with advanced medical illness, including cancer, reported both unique and shared forms of suffering. Suffering was characterized as powerlessness, threat to the caregiver’s identity, and demands exceeding resources.[ ] Because caregiver suffering can affect patient well-being and result in complicated bereavement, early identification and support of caregiver suffering are optimal.[ ] For more information, see . Palliative sedation may be defined as the deliberate pharmacological lowering of the level of consciousness, with the goal of relieving symptoms that are unacceptably distressing to the patient and refractory to optimal palliative care interventions. In considering a patient’s request for palliative sedation, clinicians need to identify any personal biases that may adversely affect their ability to respond effectively to such requests. Several points need to be borne in mind: The following questions may serve to organize discussions about the appropriateness of palliative sedation within health care teams and between clinicians,  patients, and families: The two broad indications for palliative sedation are refractory physical symptoms and refractory existential or psychological distress. A retrospective study at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston included 1,207 patients admitted to the palliative care unit. Palliative sedation was used in 15% of admissions. The most common indications were delirium (82%) and dyspnea (6%).[ ] The use of palliative sedation for refractory existential or psychological symptoms is highly controversial. In a survey of the attitudes and experiences of more than 1,000 U.S. physicians toward intentional sedation to unconsciousness until death revealed that 68% of respondents opposed palliative sedation for existential distress. Of note, only 10% of physician respondents had prescribed palliative sedation in the preceding 12 months.[ ] A previous survey conducted by the same research group reported that only 18% of surveyed physicians objected to “sedation to unconsciousness in dying patients” without a specified indication.[ ] One potential objection or concern related to palliative sedation for refractory existential or psychological distress is unrecognized but potentially remediable depression. For more information, see the section. Further objections or concerns include (1) whether the principle of an ethical basis for the use of palliative sedation for refractory physical distress, is adequate justification; and (2) cultural expectations about psychological or existential suffering at the EOL. The principle of double effect is based on the concept of proportionality. When applied to palliative sedation, this principle supports the idea that the intended effect of palliative sedation (i.e., relief of suffering) may justify a foreseeable-but-unintended consequence (such as possibly shortening  life expectancy—although this is not supported by data, as mentioned —or eliminating the opportunity to interact with loved ones) if the intended (positive) outcome is of greater value than the unintended (negative) outcome.[ ] Thus, in the case of palliative sedation for refractory psychological or existential distress, the perception that palliative sedation is not justified may reflect a devaluation of the distress associated with such suffering or that other means with fewer  negative consequences have not been fully explored. Another decision to be made  is whether the intended level of sedation is unconsciousness or a level associated with relief of the distress attributed to physical or psychological symptoms. In a survey of U.S. physicians,[ ] two-thirds of respondents felt that unconsciousness was an acceptable unintended consequence of palliative sedation, but deliberate unconsciousness was unacceptable. This finding may relate to the sense of proportionality. A qualitative study of 54 physicians who had administered palliative sedation indicated that physicians who were more concerned with ensuring that suffering was relieved were more likely to administer palliative sedation to unconsciousness. Physicians who chose mild sedation were guided more by their assessment of the patient’s condition.[ ] Palliative sedation may be provided either intermittently or continuously until death. If a clinician anticipates that a distressing symptom will improve with time, then that  clinician should discuss with the patient any recommendations about a deliberate reduction in the depth of sedation to assess whether the symptoms persist. Furthermore, deliberate reductions in the depth of sedation may be appropriate if there is a desire for communication with loved ones. For example, a single-center observational study monitored 89 (mostly male) hospice patients with cancer who received either intermittent or continuous palliative sedation with midazolam, propofol, and/or phenobarbital for delirium (61%), dyspnea (20%), or pain (15%). Mental status changes in the 37 patients who received intermittent palliative sedation for delirium were as follows, after sedation was lightened: 43.2% unchanged, 40.6% improved, and 16.2% worsened. Unsurprisingly, mental status remained the same or worsened for all patients who received continuous palliative sedation for delirium. Notably, median survival time was only 1 day for patients who received continuous sedation, compared to 6 days for the intermittent palliative sedation group, though the authors hypothesize that this difference may be attributed to a poorer baseline clinical condition in the patients who received continuous sedation rather than to a direct effect of continuous sedation.[ ] The intent of palliative sedation is to relieve suffering; it is not to shorten life. The decision to discontinue or maintain treatments such as artificial hydration or nutrition requires a review of the patient’s goals of care and the potential for benefit or harm. In general, the absence of evidence for benefit seems to justify recommendations to forgo LSTs in the context of palliative sedation. On the other hand, open lines of communication and a respectful and responsive awareness of a patient’s preferences are important to maintain during the dying process, so the clinician should not overstate the potential risks of hydration or nutrition. There is consensus that decisions about LSTs are  distinct from the decision to administer palliative sedation. Requests for hastened death or statements that express a desire to die vary from expression of a temporary or passive wish to a sustained interest in interventions to  end life or a statement of intent to plan or die by suicide.[ ] Reliable data on the frequency of requests for hastened death are not available. Requests for hastened death provide the oncology clinician with an opportunity to explore and respond to the dying patient’s experience in an attentive and compassionate manner. From the patient’s perspective, the reasons for requests for hastened death are multiple and complex and include the following: The cited studies summarize the patient’s perspectives. Surveys of health care providers demonstrate similar findings and reasons. Recommendations are based on principles of counseling and expert opinion. Specific studies are not available. The first and most important consideration is for health care providers to maintain awareness of their personal reactions to requests or statements. It is imperative that the oncology clinician expresses a supportive and accepting attitude. Providers who are too uncomfortable to engage in a discussion need  to explain to a patient the need for a referral to another provider for assistance.[ ] Other prudent advice includes the following: Family members are likely to experience grief at the death of their loved one. If left unattended, loss, grief, and bereavement can become complicated, leading to prolonged and significant distress for either family members or clinicians. Furthermore, clinicians are at risk of experiencing significant grief from the cumulative effects of many losses through the deaths of their patients. Burnout has also been associated with unresolved grief in health care professionals. For more information, see . Oncologists and nurses caring for terminally ill cancer patients are at risk of suffering personally, owing to the clinical intensity and chronic loss inherent in their work. Lack of training in advance care planning and communication can leave oncologists vulnerable to burnout, depression, and professional dissatisfaction.[ ] One group of investigators studied oncologists’ grief related to patient death and found strong impact in both the personal and professional realms. Negative effects included a sense of distraction and withdrawal from patients.[ ] One study made an important conceptual distinction, explaining that while grief is healthy for oncologists, stress and burnout can be counterproductive.[ ] Other terms used to describe professional suffering are , , and .[ ] Moral distress was measured in a descriptive pilot study involving 29 physicians and 196 nurses caring for dying patients in intensive care units. Both groups of professionals experienced moral distress related to pressure to continue aggressive treatment they considered futile. Nurses experienced more moral distress than did physicians, and perceived less collaboration than did their physician colleagues.[ ] Several strategies have been recommended to help professionals manage the emotional toll of working with advanced-cancer patients and terminally ill cancer patients, including self-care, teamwork, professional mentorship, reflective writing, mindfulness techniques, and working through the grief process.[ ] The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as new information becomes available.

ttle: Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment (PDQ®) - NCI
@: https://www.cancer.gov/types/leukemia/hp/child-aml-treatment-pdq
txt: Approximately 20% of childhood leukemias are of myeloid origin and represent a spectrum of hematopoietic malignancies.[ ]  Most myeloid leukemias in children are acute; the remainder include chronic and/or subacute myeloproliferative disorders, such as chronic myeloid leukemia and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) occur much less frequently in children than in adults and almost invariably represent clonal, preleukemic conditions that often evolve from congenital marrow failure syndromes, such as Fanconi anemia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. The general characteristics of myeloid leukemias and other myeloid malignancies are described below: For more information about TAM and MLDS, see . The presence of a karyotype abnormality in a hypocellular marrow is consistent with MDS, and transformation to AML should be expected. Patients with MDS are typically referred for stem cell transplant before transformation to AML. If a patient with MDS has a common defining genetic mutation that is seen in AML, the clinician should be aware that, despite the relatively low proportion of blasts, the child should be treated similarly to those with blast proportions of 20% or more. In children with Down syndrome younger than 4 years, the finding of MDS likely represents an early presentation of typical AML, and patients should be treated with regimens used for AML in Down syndrome. For more information, see . JMML characteristically presents with hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, fever, and skin rash, along with an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and increased circulating monocytes.[ ] In addition, patients often have elevated hemoglobin F, hypersensitivity of the leukemic cells to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monosomy 7, and leukemia cell mutations in a gene involved in RAS pathway signaling (e.g., , , , , or ).[ - ] For more information, see . CML is a clonal panmyelopathy that involves all hematopoietic cell lineages.  While the WBC count can be extremely elevated, the bone marrow does not show increased numbers of leukemic blasts during the chronic phase of this disease.  CML is caused by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (i.e., t(9;22)) resulting in fusion of the and genes. For more information, see . Other chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis, and essential thrombocytosis, are extremely rare in children. For more information, see . Genetic abnormalities (cancer predisposition syndromes) are associated with the development of AML and other myeloid malignancies.  These inherited/familial syndromes are recognized as a unique category in the 5th edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Hematolymphoid Tumors. There are also several acquired conditions that increase the risk of developing AML and other myeloid malignancies (categorized below). These inherited and acquired conditions can induce leukemogenesis through mechanisms that include chromosomal imbalances or instabilities, defects in DNA repair, altered cytokine receptor or signal transduction pathway activation, and altered protein synthesis.[ - ] Inherited syndromes Nonsyndromic genetic susceptibility to AML and other myeloid malignancies is also being studied. For example, homozygosity for a specific polymorphism has been associated with an increased risk of AML.[ - ] The 5th edition of the WHO classification system has categorized the myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition as follows:[ ] There is a high concordance rate of leukemia in identical twins. However, this finding is not believed to be related to genetic risk, but rather to shared circulation and the inability of one twin to reject leukemic cells from the other twin during fetal development.[ - ]  There is an estimated twofold to fourfold increased risk of developing leukemia for the fraternal twin of a pediatric leukemia patient up to about age 6 years, after which the risk is not significantly greater than that of the general population.[ , ] The first comprehensive morphological-histochemical classification system for
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was developed by the FAB
Cooperative Group.[ - ] This classification system, which has been replaced by the World Health Organization (WHO) system, categorized AML into major subtypes primarily on the basis of morphology and immunohistochemical detection of lineage markers. The major subtypes of AML include the following: Other extremely rare subtypes of AML include acute eosinophilic leukemia and
acute basophilic leukemia. Although the FAB classification was superseded by the WHO classification described below, it remains relevant as the basis of the WHO's subcategory of AML, defined by differentiation. AML, defined by differentiation, is used for patients whose AML does not meet the criteria for classification within all the current and newly discovered cytogenetic-specific, molecular-specific, and myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) or treatment-related AML categories. In 2001, the WHO proposed a new classification system that incorporated diagnostic cytogenetic information and that more reliably correlated with outcome.  In this classification, patients with t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17), or ( ) translocations, which collectively made up nearly half of childhood AML cases, were classified as AML with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities. This classification system also decreased the required bone marrow percentage of leukemic blasts for the diagnosis of AML from 30% to 20%. An additional clarification was made so that patients with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities did not need to meet the minimum blast requirement to be considered an AML patient.[ - ] In 2008, the WHO expanded the number of cytogenetic abnormalities linked to AML classification and, for the first time, included specific gene mutations ( and ) in its classification system.[ ] In 2016, and again in 2022, the WHO classification underwent revisions to incorporate the expanding knowledge of leukemia biomarkers, which are important to the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of leukemia.[ , ]   With emerging technologies aimed at genetic, epigenetic, proteomic, and immunophenotypic classification, AML classification will continue to evolve and provide informative prognostic and biological guidelines to clinicians and researchers. The inaugural WHO Classification of Pediatric Tumors was also published in 2022. It focuses on a multilayered approach to AML classification, encompassing multiple clinico-pathological parameters and seeking a genetic basis for disease classification wherever possible.[ , ] The recurrent translocations and other genomic alterations that are used to define specific pediatric AML entities in the pediatric WHO classification are listed in . It is critical to distinguish AML from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) because the treatment for children with AML differs significantly from that for ALL.  Special
histochemical stains  performed on bone marrow specimens of 
children with acute leukemia can be helpful to confirm their diagnosis.  The stains most
commonly used and variably positive in AML include myeloperoxidase, nonspecific esterases, and Sudan Black B, whereas periodic acid-Schiff is usually positive in ALL, M6 AML (AEL), and, occasionally, M4 and M5 FAB subtypes.  In
most cases, the pattern with these histochemical stains will
distinguish AML from ALL. However, histochemical stains have been mostly replaced by flow cytometric immunophenotyping for diagnostic purposes. The use of monoclonal antibodies via flow cytometry to determine cell-surface antigens of AML
cells is now the primary tool used to diagnose AML.  Various 
lineage-specific monoclonal antibodies that detect antigens on AML cells
should be used at the time of initial diagnostic workup, along with a battery of lineage-specific
T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte markers to help distinguish AML from ALL and acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage.  The expression of various CD proteins that
are relatively lineage-specific for AML include CD33,
CD13, CD14, CDw41 (or platelet antiglycoprotein IIb/IIIa), CD15, CD11B, CD36,
and antiglycophorin A. Lineage-associated B-lymphocytic antigens CD10, CD19,
CD20, CD22, and CD24 may be present in 10% to 20% of AML cases, but monoclonal
surface immunoglobulin and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin heavy chains are usually
absent. Similarly, lineage-associated T-lymphocytic
antigens CD2, CD3, CD5, and CD7 are present in 20% to 40% of AML cases.[ - ]  The aberrant expression of lymphoid-associated antigens by AML cells is relatively common but generally has no prognostic
significance.[ , ] Immunophenotyping can also be helpful in distinguishing the following FAB classification subtypes of
AML: Less than 5% of cases of acute leukemia in children are of ambiguous lineage, expressing features of both myeloid and lymphoid lineage.[ - ] These cases are distinct from ALL with myeloid coexpression in that the predominant lineage cannot be determined by immunophenotypic and histochemical studies. The definition of leukemia of ambiguous lineage varies among studies, although most investigators now use criteria established by the European Group for the Immunological Characterization of Leukemias (EGIL)  or the more stringent WHO criteria.[ , - ]  In the WHO classification, the presence of MPO is required to establish myeloid lineage. This is not the case for the EGIL classification. The 5th edition of the WHO classification also denotes that in some cases, leukemia with otherwise classic B-cell ALL immunophenotype may also express low-intensity MPO without other myeloid features. The clinical significance of that finding is unclear, suggesting that caution should be used in designating these cases as mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL).[ ] For the group of acute leukemias that have characteristics of both AML and ALL, the acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage, the WHO classification system is summarized in .[ ] The criteria for lineage assignment for a diagnosis of MPAL are provided in . Note that similar disease categories and diagnostic criteria are included in the International Consensus Classification of Leukemias of Ambiguous Origin.[ ] Leukemias of mixed phenotype may be seen in various presentations, including the following: Biphenotypic cases represent the majority of  mixed-phenotype leukemias.[ ]

Some studies suggest that patients with biphenotypic leukemia may fare better with a lymphoid, as opposed to a myeloid, treatment regimen.[ , , , ]; [ ][ ] A large retrospective study from the international Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) group demonstrated that initial therapy with an ALL-type regimen was associated with a superior outcome compared with AML-type or combined ALL/AML regimens, particularly in cases with CD19 positivity or other lymphoid antigen expression. In this study, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in first CR was not beneficial, with the possible exception of cases with morphological evidence of persistent marrow disease (≥5% blasts) after the first month of treatment.[ ] Genetic analysis of leukemia blast cells  (using both conventional cytogenetic methods and molecular methods) is performed on children with AML because both chromosomal and molecular abnormalities are
important diagnostic and prognostic markers.[ - ]  Clonal chromosomal
abnormalities are identified in the blasts of about 75% of children with
AML and are useful in defining subtypes with both prognostic and therapeutic significance. Detection of molecular abnormalities can also aid in risk stratification and treatment allocation. For example, mutations of and are associated with favorable outcomes, while certain mutations of portend a high risk of relapse. Identifying the latter mutations may allow for targeted therapy.[ - ] Comprehensive molecular profiling of pediatric and adult AML has shown that AML is a disease
demonstrating both commonalities and differences across the age spectrum.[ , ] The 5th edition (2022) of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Hematolymphoid Tumors, as well as the Inaugural WHO Classification of Pediatric Tumors, emphasize a multilayered approach to AML classification. These classifications consider multiple clinico-pathological parameters and seek a genetic basis for disease classification wherever possible.[ , ] These karyotypic abnormalities and other genomic alterations are used to define specific pediatric AML entities and are outlined in Table 4.[ , ] In addition to the cytogenetic/molecular abnormalities that aid AML diagnosis, as defined by the WHO, there are additional entities that, while not disease-defining, have prognostic significance in pediatric AML. All prognostic abnormalities, both those defined by the WHO and these additional abnormalities, have been clustered according to favorable or unfavorable prognosis, as defined by contemporary Children's Oncology Group (COG) clinical trials. These entities are summarized below. After these entities are described, information about additional cytogenetic/molecular and phenotypic features associated with pediatric AML will be described. However, these additional features may not, at present, be used to aid in risk stratification and treatment. While the t(15;17) fusion that results in the :: gene product is defined as a pediatric AML risk-defining lesion, given its association with acute promyelocytic leukemia, it is discussed in Childhood Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia. Specific recurring cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities are briefly described below. The abnormalities are listed by those in clinical use that identify patients with favorable or unfavorable prognosis, followed by other abnormalities. The nomenclature of the 5th edition of the WHO classification is incorporated for disease entities where relevant. Cytogenetic/molecular abnormalities associated with a favorable prognosis include the following: Cases with :: or :: fusions have distinctive secondary mutations, with :: secondary mutations primarily restricted to genes that activate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling ( , , and ).[ , ] The prognostic significance of activating mutations in adults with CBF AML has been studied with conflicting results. A meta-analysis found that mutations appear to increase the risk of relapse without an impact on OS for adults with AML and :: fusions.[ ]  The prognostic significance of mutations in pediatric CBF AML remains unclear. Some studies have found no impact of mutations on outcome,[ - ]  although, in some instances, the treatment used was heterogenous, potentially confounding the analysis. Other studies have reported a higher risk of treatment failure when mutations are present.[ - ] An analysis of a subset of pediatric patients treated with a uniform chemotherapy backbone on the COG AAML0531 study demonstrated that the subset of patients with exon 17 mutations had inferior outcomes, compared with patients with CBF AML who did not have the mutation. However, treatment with  gemtuzumab ozogamicin abrogated this negative prognostic impact.[ ] While there was a trend toward inferior outcomes for patients with CBF AML with co-occurring exon 8 abnormalities, this finding was not statistically significant. A second study of 46 patients who were treated uniformly found that exon 17 mutations only had prognostic significance in AML with :: fusions but not :: fusions.[ ] While mutations are seen in both CBF AML subsets, other secondary mutations tend to cluster with one of the two fusions. For example, patients with :: fusions also have frequent mutations in genes regulating chromatin conformation (e.g., and ) (40% of cases) and genes encoding members of the cohesin complex (20% of cases). Mutations in and and mutations in members of the cohesin complex are rare in cases with leukemia and :: fusions.[ , ] Despite this correlation, a study of 204 adults with AML and :: fusions found that mutations (present in 17% of cases) and or mutations (present in 25% of cases) lacked prognostic significance.[ ] Similar results, albeit with smaller numbers, were reported for children with the same abnormalities.[ ] Studies of children with AML suggest a   lower rate of occurrence of mutations  in  children  compared with adults with normal cytogenetics. mutations occur in approximately 8% of pediatric patients with AML and are uncommon in children younger than 2 years.[ , , , ] mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis in patients with AML characterized by a normal karyotype.[ , , ] For the pediatric population,  conflicting reports have been published regarding the prognostic significance of an mutation when a ITD mutation is also present. One study reported that an mutation did not completely abrogate the poor prognosis associated with having a ITD mutation,[ , ] but other studies showed no impact of a ITD mutation on the favorable prognosis associated with an mutation.[ , , ] mutations occur in approximately 5% of children with AML and have been preferentially found in the cytogenetically normal subtype of AML with FAB M1 or M2. Given these findings in pediatric -mutated AML, the presence of a bZip mutation alone confers a favorable prognosis. Importantly, however, there is a small subset of patients with -mutated AML who have less-favorable outcomes. Specifically, mutations occur in 10% to 15% of patients with -mutated AML. mutations appear to be associated with an increased risk of relapse, but without an impact on OS.[ , ] At present, the occurrence of this secondary mutation does not result in stratification to more intensified therapy in pediatric patients with AML. While not common, a small percentage of children with -mutated AML may have an underlying germline mutation. In newly diagnosed patients with double-mutant AML, germline screening should be considered in addition to usual family history queries because 5% to 10% of these patients have a germline abnormality that confers an increased malignancy risk.[ , ] The 5th edition (2022) of the WHO Classification of Hematolymphoid Tumors includes a diagnostic category of AML with rearrangements. Specific translocation partners are not listed because there are more than 80 fusion partners.[ ] Genetic abnormalities associated with an unfavorable prognosis are described below. Some of these are disease-defining alterations that are initiating events and maintained throughout a patient's disease course. Other entities described below are secondary alterations (e.g., alterations). Although these secondary alterations do not induce disease on their own, they are able to promote the cell growth and survival of leukemias that are driven by primary genetic alterations. Abnormalities involving can also be detected in some AML cases with other 3q abnormalities (e.g., t(3;21)(26.2;q22)). The :: fusion is also associated with poor prognosis.[ , ] t(6;9) AML appears to be associated with a high risk of treatment failure in children, particularly for those not proceeding to allogeneic HSCT.[ , , , ] In a study of approximately 2,000 children with AML, the :: fusion was identified in 39 cases (1.9%), with a median age at presentation of 1.5 years. All cases observed in children were younger than 3 years.[ ] Approximately one-half of cases had M7 megakaryoblastic morphology, and 29% of patients were Black or African American (exceeding the 12.8% frequency in patients lacking the fusion). Children with the fusion were found to be MRD positive after induction 1 in 80% of cases. In an analysis of outcomes from serial COG trials of 37 identified patients, OS at 5 years from study entry was 22.0% for patients with :: fusions versus 63.0% for fusion-negative patients (n = 1,724). Even worse outcomes were demonstrated when the subset of patients with :: AMKL were compared with patients with AMKL without the abnormality. Analysis from the  COG AAML0531 and AAML1031 trials revealed OS rates of 43% (± 37%) and 10% (± 19%), respectively, among children with AMKL and this fusion.[ ] As :: leukemias express high levels of cell surface FOLR1, a targetable surface antigen by immunotherapeutic approaches, the roles of such agents are planned for study in this high-risk population.[ , ] The :: gene fusion, which is often cytogenetically cryptic, results from the fusion of (chromosome 11p15) with (chromosome 5q35).[ , - ]   This alteration occurs in approximately 4% to 7% of pediatric AML cases.[ , , , , ] It is the most common fusion seen. This disease phenotype is characterized by the following: A cytogenetically cryptic translocation, t(11;12)(p15;p13), results in the :: gene fusion.[ ] Approximately 2% of all pediatric AML patients have :: fusions, and these cases tend to present at a young age (median age,  3 years).[ ] Additional clinical characteristics are as follows: In the past, patients with del(7q) were also considered to be at high risk of treatment failure, and data from adults with AML support a poor prognosis for both del(7q) and monosomy 7.[ ]  However, outcome for children with del(7q), but not monosomy 7, appears comparable to that of other children with AML.[ , ] The presence of del(7q) does not abrogate the prognostic significance of favorable cytogenetic characteristics (e.g., inv(16) and t(8;21)).[ , ] The prognostic significance of ITD is modified by the presence of other recurring genomic alterations.[ , ] For patients who have ITD, the presence of either mutations or :: fusions is associated with poorer outcomes (EFS rates below 25%) than for patients who have ITD without these alterations.[ ] Conversely, a co-occurring cryptic :: fusion may be more favorable, particularly with the addition of a FLT3 inhibitor to standard front-line chemotherapy. When ITD is accompanied by mutations, the outcome is relatively favorable and is similar to that of pediatric AML cases without ITD.[ ]  The latter subset is the one scenario in which the presence of the ITD mutation does not necessarily upstage a patient to high risk, based on the favorable outcomes seen with the co-occurring mutations.[ ] Activating point mutations of have also been identified in both adults and children with AML, although the clinical significance of these mutations is not clearly defined. Some of these point mutations appear to be specific to pediatric patients.[ ] This section includes cytogenetic/molecular abnormalities that are seen at diagnosis and do not impact disease risk stratification but may have prognostic significance. An international collaborative retrospective study of 51 t(1;22) cases reported that patients with this abnormality had a 5-year EFS rate of 54.5% and an OS rate of 58.2%, similar to the rates for other children with AMKL.[ ] In another international retrospective analysis of 153 cases with non–Down syndrome AMKL who had samples available for molecular analysis, the 4-year EFS rate for patients with t(1;22) was 59% and the OS rate was 70%, significantly better than for AMKL patients with other specific genetic abnormalities ( :: fusions, :: fusions, rearrangements, monosomy 7).[ ] Similar outcomes were seen in the COG AAML0531 and AAML1031 phase III trials (5-year OS rates, 86% ± 26% [n = 7] and 54% ± 14% [n = 14] for AAML0531 and AAML1031, respectively).[ ] In a study of children with AML, mutations were observed in 11 of 503 patients (approximately 2%). Six of 11 patients with -mutated AML failed to achieve remission, and their 5-year EFS rate was 9%, suggesting that the mutation confers a poor prognosis in both children and adults.[ ] However, a second study in which 23 children were found to have mutations among 488 children with AML found no significant impact of mutations on response or outcome. Additionally, analysis identified that children with mutations were more frequently male, adolescents, and had a greater incidence of co-occurring ITD and other mutations. However, in each of these groups, univariable and multivariable analyses found no survival differences based on the presence of mutations.[ ] Genetic mutations of result in a familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancy (FPD-MM).[ ] In children with AML, mutations are observed in approximately 10% of cases.[ , ] Cases with mutations are enriched among children with normal cytogenetics and ITD but are less common among children younger than 3 years.[ , ] AML cases with :: fusions are enriched for both ITD and mutations.[ ] In univariate analyses, mutations are predictive of poorer outcome in pediatric patients, but the independent prognostic significance of mutation status is unclear because of its strong association with ITD and its association with :: fusions.[ , , ] The largest study of mutations in children with AML observed that children with mutations in the absence of ITD had outcomes similar to that of children without mutations, while children with both mutations and ITD had survival rates less than 20%.[ ] In a study of children with refractory AML, was overrepresented, compared with a cohort who did achieve remission  (54% [15 of 28 patients] vs. 15%).[ ] Mutations in and are rare in pediatric AML, occurring in 0% to 4% of cases.[ , , - ]  There is no indication of a negative prognostic effect for and mutations in children with AML.[ , ] Activating mutations in are also observed in patients with severe congenital neutropenia. These mutations are not the cause of severe congenital neutropenia, but rather arise as somatic mutations and can represent an early step in the pathway to AML.[ ] In one study of patients with severe congenital neutropenia, 34% of patients who had not developed a myeloid malignancy had mutations detectable in peripheral blood neutrophils and mononuclear cells, while 78% of patients who had developed a myeloid malignancy showed mutations.[ ] A study of 31 patients with severe congenital neutropenia who developed AML or MDS observed mutations in approximately 80% of patients. The study also observed a high frequency of mutations (approximately 60%), suggesting cooperation between and mutations for leukemia development within the context of severe congenital neutropenia.[ ] Childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is diagnosed when the bone marrow has 20%  or greater blasts or when a lower blast percentage is present but molecular evaluation reveals an AML-defining genetic abnormality.[ ] For information about the defining abnormalities, see the section. Leukemia is considered to be disseminated in the hematopoietic
system at diagnosis, even in children with AML who
present with isolated chloromas (also called granulocytic or myeloid sarcomas).  These children invariably develop AML in months to years if they do not receive systemic chemotherapy.  AML may invade nonhematopoietic (extramedullary) tissue such as meninges,
brain parenchyma, testes or ovaries, or skin (leukemia cutis).  Extramedullary
leukemia is more common in infants than in older children with AML.[ ] Granulocytic sarcoma (chloroma) describes extramedullary collections of leukemia cells. These collections can occur, albeit rarely, as the sole evidence of leukemia. In a review of three AML studies conducted by the former Children's Cancer Group, fewer than 1% of patients had isolated granulocytic sarcoma, and 11% had granulocytic sarcoma along with marrow disease at the time of diagnosis.[ ] This incidence was also seen in the trial.[ ] Patients with isolated granulocytic sarcoma have a good prognosis if treated with current AML therapy.[ ] In a study of 1,459 children with newly diagnosed  AML, patients with orbital granulocytic sarcoma and central nervous system (CNS) granulocytic sarcoma had better survival than patients with marrow disease and granulocytic sarcoma at other sites and AML patients without any extramedullary disease.[ , ]  Most patients with orbital granulocytic sarcoma have a t(8;21) abnormality, which has been associated with a favorable prognosis. The use of radiation therapy does not improve survival in patients with granulocytic sarcoma who have a complete response to chemotherapy. However, radiation therapy may be necessary if the site(s) of granulocytic sarcoma do not show complete response to chemotherapy or for disease that recurs locally.[ ] CNS involvement is often described as extramedullary disease and included in overall summaries of extramedullary disease. However, it has a distinct prognostic impact and requires therapeutic alterations. It is therefore discussed in detail in sections for both prognosis and treatment. The first goal in the treatment of AML is to eradicate all identifiable evidence of leukemia, also known as complete remission (CR). CR has traditionally been defined in the United States using morphological criteria such as the following: Alternative definitions of remission using morphology are used in AML because of the prolonged myelosuppression caused by intensive chemotherapy. These definitions include CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp)  and CR with incomplete marrow recovery (typically absolute neutrophil count) (CRi). Whereas the use of CRp provides a clinically meaningful response in studies of adults with AML, the traditional CR definition remains the gold standard because patients in CR were more likely to survive longer than those in CRp.[ ] Achieving a hypoplastic bone marrow (using morphology)
is usually the first step in obtaining remission in AML, with the
exception of the M3 subtype (acute promyelocytic leukemia [APL]). In APL, a hypoplastic marrow
phase is often not necessary before the achievement of remission. 
Additionally, early recovery marrows in any of the subtypes of AML may be
difficult to distinguish from persistent leukemia, although the application of flow cytometric immunophenotyping and cytogenetic/molecular testing have  made this less problematic. Correlation with blood
cell counts and clinical status is
imperative in passing final judgment on the results of early bone marrow
findings in AML.[ ] If the findings are in doubt, a bone marrow
aspirate should be repeated in 1 to 2 weeks.[ ] In addition to morphology, more precise methodology (e.g., multiparameter flow cytometry or quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) is used to assess response. These methods have proven to be of greater prognostic significance than morphology. For more information about these methodologies, see the section. The mainstay of the therapeutic
approach is systemically administered combination chemotherapy. Approaches involving risk-group stratification and biologically targeted therapies are being tested to improve antileukemic treatment while sparing normal tissue. Optimal
treatment of AML requires control of bone marrow and systemic disease. Treatment of the CNS, usually with intrathecal medication,
is a component of most pediatric AML protocols but has not yet been shown to
contribute directly to an improvement in survival. CNS  irradiation is not necessary in patients, either as prophylaxis or for those presenting with cerebrospinal fluid leukemia that clears with intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy. Treatment is ordinarily divided into the following two phases: Induction therapy typically involves several (usually 2–4) cycles of intensive chemotherapy. Past approaches often had four cycles of chemotherapy comprising the entire induction course. Contemporary protocols have combined the first two and the last two cycles into two more intensified cycles of overall induction, which has improved event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Postremission
therapy may consist of varying numbers of courses of intensive chemotherapy
and/or allogeneic  hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).  For example,  the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) and the United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC) use similar chemotherapy regimens consisting of two courses of induction chemotherapy, followed by two to three additional courses of intensification chemotherapy.[ - ] Maintenance chemotherapy is no longer part of pediatric AML protocols  because two randomized clinical trials failed to show a benefit for maintenance therapy when given after modern intensive chemotherapy.[ , ] Contemporary APL therapy also does not use maintenance chemotherapy. A tretinoin- and arsenic trioxide–based treatment is used instead.[ ] Maintenance therapy with targeted therapies is gaining interest. Treatment of patients with AML and internal tandem duplication (ITD) using sorafenib (a FLT3 inhibitor) during chemotherapy cycles and maintenance (following completion of chemotherapy or HSCT) significantly improved survival.[ ] Attention to both acute and long-term complications is critical in children with AML. Modern AML treatment approaches are usually associated with severe, protracted myelosuppression with related complications. Children with AML should receive care under the direction of pediatric oncologists in cancer centers or hospitals with appropriate supportive care facilities (e.g., specialized blood products; pediatric intensive care; provision of emotional and developmental support). With improved supportive care, toxic death constitutes a smaller proportion of initial therapy failures than in the past.[ ] Two COG trials reported an 11% to 13% incidence of remission failure, mainly  because of resistant disease. Only 2% to 3% resulted from toxic death during the two induction courses.[ , ] Children treated for AML are living longer and require close monitoring for cancer therapy side effects that may persist or develop months or years after treatment. The high cumulative doses of anthracyclines require long-term monitoring of cardiac function. The use of some modalities, including total-body irradiation with HSCT, have declined because of increased risk of growth failure, gonadal and thyroid dysfunction, cataract formation, and second malignancies.[ ] For more information, see the section and . Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer.[ ] Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[ - ] For AML, the 5-year survival rate increased over the same time, from less than 20% to 69% for children younger than 15 years and from less than 20% to 72% for adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[ , ] Most contemporary comparisons also show that OS rates have improved over the past three decades for children with AML, with 5-year survival rates now in the 55% to 70% range.[ - ]    Overall remission-induction rates are approximately 85% to 90%, and EFS rates from the time of diagnosis are in the 45% to 55% range.[ - ] There is, however, a wide range in outcomes for different biological subtypes of AML. After taking specific biological factors of their leukemia into account, the predicted outcome for any individual patient may be much better or much worse than the overall outcome for the general population of children with AML.  For more information, see the sections on and . Prognostic factors in childhood AML can be categorized as follows: While outcome for infants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains inferior to that of older children, outcome for infants (<12 months) with AML is similar to that of older children when they are treated with standard AML regimens.[ , - ] Infants have been reported to have a 5-year survival rate of 60% to 70%, but with increased treatment-associated toxicity, particularly during induction.[ , - ] In a retrospective study of non–Down syndrome M7 patients with samples available for molecular analysis, the presence of specific genetic abnormalities ( :: [cryptic inv(16)(p13q24)], :: , t(11;12)(p15;p13), [ ] rearrangements, monosomy 7) was associated with a significantly worse outcome than for  other M7 patients.[ , ] By contrast, the 10% of patients with AMKL and mutations without Down syndrome appeared to have a favorable outcome if there were no prognostically unfavorable fusion genes also present, as did patients with rearrangement.[ ] COG trials (including , , and ) used a modified version of the CNS disease definitions, in which patients were dichotomously classified for treatment purposes as CNS positive or negative. The CNS-positive group included all patients with blasts on cytospin (regardless of CSF WBC) unless there were more than 100 RBC/μL in the CSF. Patients with 100 RBC/μL in the CSF were  CNS positive only if the WBC/RBC ratio in the CSF was greater than or equal to twice the ratio in the peripheral blood. CNS outcomes on COG studies were analyzed using the more traditional CNS1/2/3 definitions.[ ] In children with AML, CNS2 disease has been observed in approximately 13% to 16% of cases, and CNS3 disease has been observed in approximately 11% to 17% of cases.[ , ] Studies have variably shown that patients with CNS2/CNS3 disease were younger, more often had hyperleukocytosis, and had higher incidences of t(9;11), t(8;21), or inv(16).[ , ] While CNS involvement (CNS2 or CNS3) at diagnosis has not been shown to be correlated with OS in most studies, a COG analysis of children with AML enrolled from 2003 to 2010 on two consecutive and identical backbone trials found that CNS disease, especially CNS3 status, was associated with inferior outcomes, including decreased CR rate, EFS, and disease-free survival (DFS), and an increased risk of relapse involving the CNS.[ ] Another trial showed it to be associated with an increased risk of isolated CNS relapse.[ ] Finally, the COG study did not find traumatic lumbar punctures at diagnosis to have an adverse impact on eventual outcome.[ ] Molecular approaches (e.g., using quantitative RT-PCR) have been challenging to apply because of the genomic heterogeneity of pediatric AML and the instability of some genomic alterations.  Results have shown the following: Flow cytometry has been used for MRD detection and can detect leukemic blasts based on the expression of aberrant surface antigens that differ from the pattern observed in normal progenitors. Risk classification for treatment assignment has been used by several cooperative groups performing clinical trials in children with AML.  In the COG, stratifying therapeutic choices on the basis of risk factors is a relatively recent approach for the non-APL, non–Down syndrome patient. Classification is most directly derived from the observations of the MRC AML 10 trial for EFS and OS.[ ] Classification is further applied based on  the ability of the pediatric patient to undergo reinduction to obtain a second complete remission and their subsequent OS after first relapse.[ ] The following COG trials have used a risk classification system to stratify treatment choices: Where risk factors contradicted each other, the following evidence-based table was used (see ). The high-risk group of patients was guided to transplant in first remission with the most appropriate available donor. Patients in the low-risk group were instructed to pursue transplant if they relapsed.[ , ] The COG trial for patients with newly diagnosed AML uses a more complex risk-stratification system. This system incorporates more genetic lesions into the high-risk group and builds on the use of MRD as a strong prognostic marker.[ ] Risk factors used for stratification vary by pediatric and adult cooperative clinical trial groups. The prognostic impact of a given risk factor may vary in their significance depending on the backbone of therapy used.  Other pediatric cooperative groups use some or all of these same factors, generally choosing risk factors  that have been reproducible across numerous trials and sometimes including additional risk factors previously used in their risk group stratification approach. Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has been slowly increasing since 1975.[ ]  Children and adolescents with
cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.[ ]  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
that will achieve optimal survival and quality of life. For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on . The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children with
cancer.[ ]  At these
pediatric cancer centers, clinical trials are available for most 
types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity to
participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents with cancer are generally designed to
compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy.  Most of the progress made in identifying curative therapies
for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.  For more information
about ongoing clinical trials, see the . The general principles of therapy for children and adolescents with acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) are discussed below. For information about the treatment of children with Down syndrome, see . For information about the treatment of children with acute  promyelocytic leukemia
(APL), see . Contemporary pediatric AML protocols result in  85% to 90% complete
remission (CR) rates.[ - ]  To achieve a CR, inducing
profound bone marrow aplasia (with the exception of the M3 APL subtype) is
usually necessary with currently used combination-chemotherapy regimens.  Because induction chemotherapy produces severe
myelosuppression, morbidity and mortality from infection or hemorrhage during
the induction period may be significant.  Approximately 2% to 3% of patients die during the induction phase, most often caused by treatment-related complications.[ - ] Treatment options for children with AML during the induction phase may include the following: Common induction therapy regimens in children with AML use cytarabine and an anthracycline in
combination with other agents such as etoposide and/or thioguanine.[ - ] Evidence (induction chemotherapy regimen): The anthracycline that has been most used in induction regimens for children
with AML is daunorubicin,[ - ] although idarubicin  and the anthracenedione mitoxantrone have also been used.[ , , ] Randomized trials have attempted to determine whether any other anthracycline or anthracenedione is superior to daunorubicin as a component of induction therapy for children with AML.  
In the absence of convincing data that another anthracycline
 or mitoxantrone produces superior outcome over daunorubicin when given at an equitoxic dose,
daunorubicin remains the anthracycline most commonly used during induction
therapy for children with AML in the United States. Evidence (daunorubicin vs. other anthracyclines): Although the combination of an anthracycline and cytarabine is the basis of initial standard induction therapy for adults and children, there is evidence that alternative drugs can be used to reduce the use of anthracyclines when necessary. Evidence (reduced-anthracycline induction regimen): The intensity of induction therapy influences the overall outcome of therapy. 
The CCG-2891 study demonstrated that intensively timed induction therapy (4-day
treatment courses separated by only 6 days) produced better EFS than standard-timing induction therapy (4-day treatment courses separated by
2 weeks or longer).[ ]  The MRC has intensified induction therapy by
prolonging the duration of cytarabine treatment to 10 days.[ ] In adults, another method of
intensifying induction therapy is to use high-dose cytarabine.  While
studies in nonelderly adults suggest an advantage for intensifying induction
therapy with high-dose cytarabine (2–3 g/m /dose) compared with standard-dose
cytarabine,[ ] a benefit for the use of high-dose cytarabine in children was not observed using a cytarabine dose
of 1 g/m given twice daily for 7 days with daunorubicin and thioguanine.[ ] A second pediatric study also failed to detect a benefit for high-dose cytarabine over standard-dose cytarabine when used during induction therapy.[ ] Because further intensification of induction regimens has increased toxicity with little improvement in EFS or OS, alternative approaches, such as the use of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, have been examined. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a CD33-directed monoclonal antibody linked to a calicheamicin, a cytotoxic agent. Evidence (gemtuzumab ozogamicin during induction): Fractionated gemtuzumab ozogamicin dosing (3 mg/m per dose on days 1, 4, and 7; maximum dose, 5 mg), which has been shown to be safe and effective in adult patients with de novo AML, is an alternative option to single-dose administration during induction.[ ] Because  this is the recommended dosing method for adults, this schedule is now being evaluated in the phase III study for pediatric patients with de novo AML in the United Kingdom. The characteristics of CD33, the target of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, have been examined to further identify the patients who will benefit most from this agent. Similar to immunotherapeutic approaches, the use of targeted therapy attempts to circumvent the severe toxicity of traditional chemotherapy by employing agents that target leukemia-specific mutations and/or their abnormal present or missing byproducts.  While randomized clinical trials have not yet demonstrated that targeted therapies improve outcomes in children with newly diagnosed AML, single-arm trials have demonstrated a survival benefit, such as the sorafenib trial described below. Because most data on the use of targeted agents are from adult clinical trials, the adult experience is initially described, followed by a description of the more limited experience in children. Because of the high prevalence of mutations in adult AML and the adverse impact in patients with AML of all ages, the target has received the greatest attention for target-specific drug development in AML.  Among the various FLT3 inhibitors developed and clinically studied, midostaurin, a multikinase inhibitor, is the only one with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for adult de novo AML. It was approved in 2017 for use with conventional backbone chemotherapy but not as a single agent.[ ] Evidence (midostaurin for adults with de novo AML): Midostaurin has been studied in children with relapsed/refractory AML,[ ] but there is no experience with midostaurin in children with newly diagnosed AML. For more information, see the section. Sorafenib, another multikinase inhibitor,  has been approved for the treatment  of other malignancies, but it has not been approved for use in patients with AML. This agent has been evaluated for use in adult and pediatric patients with de novo -mutated AML. Evidence (sorafenib): In children with AML receiving modern intensive therapy, the estimated incidence of severe bacterial infections is 50% to 60%, and the estimated incidence of invasive fungal infections is 7.0% to 12.5%.[ - ]  Several approaches have been examined to reduce the morbidity and mortality from infection in children with AML. The use of antibacterial prophylaxis in children undergoing treatment for AML has been supported by several studies. Studies, including one prospective randomized trial, suggest a benefit to the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. Evidence (antimicrobial prophylaxis): Antifungal prophylaxis is important in the management of patients with AML. Evidence (antifungal prophylaxis): Hematopoietic growth factors such as 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or G-CSF during AML induction therapy have been
evaluated in multiple placebo-controlled studies in adults with AML in attempts to reduce the
toxicity associated with prolonged myelosuppression.[ ] These studies have generally shown a reduction in the duration of neutropenia of several days with the use of either
G-CSF or GM-CSF [ ] but have not shown significant effects on treatment-related mortality or OS.[ ] For more information, see the section in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment. Routine prophylactic use of hematopoietic growth factors is not recommended for children with AML. Evidence (against the use of hematopoietic growth factors): Bacteremia or sepsis and anthracycline use have been identified as significant risk factors in the development of cardiotoxicity,  manifested as reduced left ventricular function.[ , ] Monitoring of cardiac function through the use of serial exams during therapy is an effective method for detecting cardiotoxicity and adjusting therapy as indicated. The use of dexrazoxane in conjunction with bolus dosing of anthracyclines can be an effective method of reducing the risk of cardiac dysfunction during therapy.[ ] Evidence (cardiac monitoring/dexrazoxane impact): Hospitalization until adequate granulocyte (absolute neutrophil or phagocyte count) recovery has been used to reduce treatment-related mortality. To avoid prolonged hospitalizations until count recovery, some institutions have used outpatient IV antibiotic prophylaxis effectively.[ ] Therapy with either radiation or intrathecal chemotherapy has been used to treat CNS leukemia present at diagnosis. However,  the use of radiation has essentially been abandoned as a means of prophylaxis because of the lack of documented benefit and long-term sequelae.[ ]  Intrathecal chemotherapy is used to prevent later development of CNS leukemia. The COG has historically used single-agent cytarabine for both CNS prophylaxis and therapy.  Other groups have attempted to prevent CNS relapse by using additional intrathecal agents.  Similarly, the ongoing COG trial incorporates the use of intrathecal triples (methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone). CNS involvement in patients with AML and its impact on prognosis has been discussed in the section. Evidence (CNS prophylaxis): A major challenge in the treatment of children with AML is to prolong the duration of the initial remission with additional chemotherapy or HSCT. Treatment options for children with AML in postremission may include the following: Postremission chemotherapy includes some of the drugs used in induction while introducing non–cross-resistant drugs and, commonly, high-dose cytarabine. Studies in adults with AML have demonstrated that consolidation with a high-dose cytarabine regimen improves outcome, compared with consolidation with a standard-dose cytarabine regimen, particularly in patients with inv(16) and t(8;21) AML subtypes.[ ] For more information about the treatment of adults with AML, see the section in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment. Randomized studies evaluating the contribution of high-dose cytarabine to postremission therapy have not been conducted in children, but studies employing historical controls suggest that consolidation with a high-dose cytarabine regimen improves outcome compared with less-intensive consolidation therapies.[ , , ] The optimal number of postremission courses of therapy remains unclear, but it appears that at least two to three courses of intensive therapy are required after induction.[ ] Evidence (number of postremission courses of chemotherapy): Additional study of the number of intensification courses and specific agents used will better address this issue. However, these data suggest that four chemotherapy courses should only be administered to the favorable group described above, and that all other patients who do not undergo HSCT should receive five chemotherapy courses. The use of HSCT in first remission has been under evaluation since the late 1970s, and evidence-based appraisals  concerning indications for autologous and allogeneic HSCT have been published. Prospective trials of transplants in children with AML suggest that overall, 60% to 70% of children with HLA-matched donors available who undergo allogeneic HSCT during their first remission experience long-term remissions,[ , ] with the caveat that outcome after allogeneic HSCT is dependent on risk-classification status.[ ] In prospective trials that compared allogeneic HSCT with chemotherapy and/or autologous HSCT, superior DFS rates were observed for patients who were assigned to allogeneic HSCT on the basis of family 6/6 or 5/6 HLA-matched donors in adults and children.[ , , - ] However, the superiority of allogeneic HSCT over chemotherapy has not always been observed.[ ] Several large cooperative group clinical trials for children with AML have found no benefit for autologous HSCT over intensive chemotherapy.[ , , , ] Current application of allogeneic HSCT involves incorporation of risk classification to determine whether transplant should be pursued in first remission. An analysis from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) examined pretransplant variables to create a model for predicting leukemia-free survival (LFS) posttransplant in pediatric patients (aged <18 years).  All patients were first transplant recipients who had myeloablative conditioning, and all stem cells sources were included. For patients with AML, the predictors associated with lower LFS included age younger than 3 years, intermediate-risk or poor-risk cytogenetics,   and second CR or higher with MRD positivity or not in CR. A scale was established to stratify patients on the basis of risk factors to predict survival. The 5-year LFS rate was 78% for the  low-risk group, 53% for the intermediate-risk group, 40% for the high-risk group, and 25% for the very high-risk group.[ ] Patients receiving contemporary chemotherapy regimens have improved outcome if they have favorable prognostic features (low-risk cytogenetic or molecular mutations). This finding and the lack of demonstrable superiority for HSCT in this patient population means that such patients typically receive matched-family donor (MFD) HSCT only after first relapse and the achievement of a second CR.[ , - ] There is conflicting evidence regarding the role of allogeneic HSCT in first remission for patients with intermediate-risk characteristics (neither low-risk or high-risk cytogenetics or molecular mutations). Evidence (allogeneic HSCT in first remission for patients with intermediate-risk AML): Given the improved outcome for patients with  intermediate-risk AML in recent clinical trials and the burden of acute and chronic toxicities associated with allogeneic transplant, many childhood AML treatment groups (including the COG) employ chemotherapy for intermediate-risk patients in first remission and reserve allogeneic HSCT for use after potential relapses.[ , , ] There are conflicting data regarding  the role of allogeneic HSCT in first remission for patients with high-risk disease, complicated by the varying definitions of high risk used by different study groups. Many, but not all, pediatric clinical trial groups prescribe allogeneic HSCT for high-risk patients in first remission.[ ]  For example, the COG frontline AML clinical trial ( ) prescribes allogeneic HSCT in first remission only for patients with predicted high risk of treatment failure based on unfavorable cytogenetic and molecular characteristics and elevated end-of-induction MRD levels. On the other hand, the AML-BFM trials restrict allogeneic HSCT to patients in second CR or patients with refractory AML. This was  based on results from their AML-BFM 98 study, which found no improvement in DFS or OS for high-risk patients receiving allogeneic HSCT in first CR, as well as the successful treatment using HSCT for a substantial proportion of patients who achieved a second CR.[ , ] Additionally, late sequelae (e.g., cardiomyopathy, skeletal anomalies, and liver dysfunction or cirrhosis) were increased for children undergoing allogeneic HSCT in first remission on the AML-BFM 98 study.[ ] Evidence (allogeneic HSCT in first remission for patients with high-risk AML): Further analysis of subpopulations of patients treated with allogeneic HSCT will be an ongoing need in current and future clinical trials because of the evolving definitions of high-, intermediate-, and low-risk AML, the ongoing association of molecular characteristics of the tumor with outcome (e.g., ITD, mutations, and mutations), and response to therapy (e.g., MRD assessments postinduction therapy). If transplant is chosen in first CR, the optimal preparative regimen and source of donor cells has not been determined, although alternative donor sources, including haploidentical donors, are being studied.[ , , ] There are no data that suggest total-body irradiation (TBI)  is superior to busulfan-based myeloablative regimens.[ , ] Additionally, outstanding outcomes have been noted for patients who were treated with treosulfan-based regimens. However, trials comparing treosulfan with busulfan or TBI are lacking.[ ] Evidence (myeloablative regimen): There are no data that demonstrate that maintenance therapy given after intensive postremission therapy significantly prolongs remission duration. Maintenance chemotherapy failed to show benefit in two randomized studies that used modern intensive consolidation therapy.[ , ] Maintenance therapy with interleukin-2 also proved ineffective.[ ] Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)–supported clinical trials can be found on the . For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the . The following is an example of a national and/or institutional clinical trial that is currently being conducted: Use our to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. about clinical trials is also available. The diagnosis of recurrent acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is made when patients who were in previous remission after therapy develop more than 5% bone marrow blasts. The diagnosis of refractory AML is made when complete remission is not achieved by the end of induction therapy. Approximately 50% to 60% of relapses occur within the
first year after diagnosis, with most relapses occurring by 4 years after
diagnosis.[ ]  The majority of relapses occur in the bone marrow, and central nervous system (CNS)
relapse is very uncommon.[ ] Factors associated with survival include the following: Additional prognostic factors were identified in the following studies: Patients with subsequent relapses and those with refractory first relapses have declining outcomes with each event. In the TACL analysis, remission outcomes, primarily in patients with early relapses, declined with each attempt to reinduce remission (56% ± 5%, 25% ± 8%, and 17% ± 7% for each consecutive attempt).[ ] An analysis by the NOPHO group found a 5-year OS rate of 17% in children who had a second relapse or in children who had a refractory first relapse and were subsequently treated with curative intent.[ ] Treatment options for children with recurrent AML may include the following: Regimens that have been successfully used to induce remission in children with
recurrent AML have commonly included high-dose cytarabine given in combination
with the following agents: The standard-dose cytarabine regimens used in the
United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC) AML10 study for newly diagnosed children with AML (cytarabine and
daunorubicin plus either etoposide or thioguanine) have, when used in the setting of relapse, produced remission
rates similar to those achieved with high-dose cytarabine regimens.[ ]
In a COG phase II study, the addition of bortezomib to idarubicin plus low-dose cytarabine resulted in an overall CR rate of 57%. The addition of bortezomib  to etoposide and high-dose cytarabine resulted in an overall CR rate of 48%.[ ] Before its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use in children with de novo AML in 2020, gemtuzumab ozogamicin was approved for children with relapsed or refractory AML who are aged 2 years and older. Evidence (gemtuzumab ozogamicin with or without chemotherapy): There is limited experience with midostaurin in pediatric patients with AML. A phase II trial is under way in Europe, beginning with the 30 mg/m twice-daily dosing ( ). As in de novo AML, most of the focus and published experience with FLT3 inhibitors is in adults with AML and this applies to the relapsed and refractory setting as well. Gilteritinib is a type 1 selective FLT3 inhibitor with activity against both mutations (ITD and D835/I836 tyrosine kinase domain [TKD]).  In relapsed or refractory AML, gilteritinib is the first and only FLT3 inhibitor that has received FDA approval for single-agent use in adults. The approval was based on the trial.[ ] Gilteritinib is now being studied in children with -positive de novo AML in the COG trial. Sorafenib has been evaluated in pediatric patients with relapsed and refractory AML. The selection of additional treatment after the achievement of a second
CR depends on previous treatment and individual considerations. 
Consolidation chemotherapy followed by  HSCT is  conventionally recommended, although there are no  controlled prospective data regarding the contribution of additional courses of therapy once a second CR is obtained.[ ] Evidence (HSCT after second CR): There is evidence that long-term survival can be achieved in a portion of pediatric patients who undergo a second transplant subsequent to relapse after a first myeloablative transplant.   Improved survival was associated with late relapse (>6–12 months  from first transplant), achievement of complete response before the second procedure, and use of a second myeloablative regimen if possible.[ - ] Isolated CNS relapse occurs in 3% to 6% of pediatric patients with AML.[ - ] Factors associated with an increased risk of isolated CNS relapse include the following:[ ] The risk of CNS relapse increases with more CNS leukemic involvement at initial AML diagnosis (CNS1: 0.6%, CNS2: 2.6%, CNS3: 5.8% incidence of isolated CNS relapse, < .001; multivariate HR for CNS3: 7.82, = .0003).[ ] The outcome of isolated CNS relapse when treated as a systemic relapse is similar to that of bone marrow relapse. In one study, the 8-year OS rate for a cohort of children with an isolated CNS relapse was 26% (± 16%).[ ] Concurrent bone marrow and CNS relapses can occur, and the incidence increases with CNS involvement at diagnosis (CNS1: 2.7%, CNS2: 8.5%, CNS3: 9.2%, < .001).[ ] Induction failure (the morphological presence of 5% or greater marrow blasts at the end of all induction courses) is seen in 10% to 15% of children with AML. Subsequent outcomes for  patients with induction failure are similar to those for patients with AML who relapse early (<12 months after remission).[ , ] Treatment options for children with refractory AML may include the following: Like patients with relapsed AML, patients with induction failure are typically directed toward HSCT once they attain a remission. Studies suggest a better EFS rate in patients treated with HSCT than in patients treated with chemotherapy only (31.2% vs. 5%; < .0001).  Attainment of morphological CR for these patients is a significant prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS) after HSCT (46% vs. 0%; = .02). Failure primarily resulted from relapse (relapse risk, 53.9% vs. 88.9%; = .02).[ ] For more information about chemotherapy to induce remission, see the section in the Treatment of Recurrent AML section. Evidence (treatment of refractory childhood AML with gemtuzumab ozogamicin): Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)–supported clinical trials can be found on the . For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the . Use our to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. about clinical trials is also available. The development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) after treatment with ionizing radiation or chemotherapy, particularly alkylating agents and topoisomerase inhibitors, is termed therapy-related AML (t-AML) or therapy-related MDS (t-MDS).  In addition to genotoxic exposures, genetic predisposition susceptibilities (such as polymorphisms in drug detoxification and DNA repair pathway components) may contribute to the occurrence of secondary AML/MDS.[ - ] The risk of t-AML or t-MDS depends on the treatment regimen. It is often related to the cumulative doses of chemotherapy agents received and the dose and field of radiation administered.[ ]  Regimens previously used that employed high cumulative doses of either epipodophyllotoxins (e.g., etoposide or teniposide) or alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, melphalan, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide) induced excessively high rates of t-AML or t-MDS that exceeded 10% in some cases.[ , ]  However, most current chemotherapy regimens that are used to treat childhood cancers have a cumulative incidence of t-AML or t-MDS no greater than 1% to 2%. t-AML or t-MDS resulting from exposures to epipodophyllotoxins and other topoisomerase II inhibitors (e.g., anthracyclines) usually occur within 2 years of treatment  and are commonly associated with chromosome 11q23 abnormalities.[ ] Other subtypes of AML (e.g., acute promyelocytic leukemia) have also been reported.[ , ] t-AML that occurs after exposure to alkylating agents or ionizing radiation often presents 5 to 7 years later and is commonly associated with monosomies or deletions of chromosomes 5 and 7.[ , ] Treatment options for t-AML or t-MDS include the following: The goal of treatment is to achieve an initial complete remission (CR) using AML-directed regimens and then, usually, to proceed directly to HSCT with the best available donor.  However, treatment is challenging because of the following:[ ] Accordingly, CR rates and overall survival (OS) rates are usually lower for patients with t-AML than for patients with de novo AML.[ - ] Also, pediatric patients with t-MDS have worse survival rates than  pediatric patients with MDS not related to previous therapy.[ ] Patients with t-MDS-refractory anemia usually have not needed induction chemotherapy before transplant. The role of induction therapy before transplant is controversial in patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts-1. Only a few reports describe the outcome of children undergoing HSCT for t-AML. Evidence (HSCT for t-AML or t-MDS): Because t-AML is rare in children, it is not known whether the significant decrease in transplant-related mortality after unrelated-donor HSCT noted over the past several years will translate to improved survival in this population.  Patients should be carefully assessed for pre-HSCT morbidities caused by earlier therapies, and treatment approaches should be adapted to give adequate intensity while minimizing transplant-related mortality. While the issues of long-term complications of cancer and its treatment cross many disease categories, several important issues related to the treatment of myeloid malignancies are worth emphasizing.   For more information, see . Selected studies of the late effects of  acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy in adult survivors who were not treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) include the following: Renal, gastrointestinal, and hepatic late adverse effects  were rare for children who received chemotherapy only for treatment of AML.[ ] Selected studies of the late effects of AML therapy in adult survivors who were treated with HSCT include the following: New therapeutic approaches to reduce long-term adverse sequelae are needed, especially for reducing the late sequelae associated with myeloablative HSCT. Important resources for details on follow-up and risks for survivors of cancer have been developed, including the COG’s and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's .  Furthermore, having access to past medical history that can be shared with subsequent medical providers has become increasingly recognized as important for cancer survivors.

ttle: Complications, GVHD, and Late Effects After Pediatric HSCT (PDQ®) - NCI
@: https://www.cancer.gov/types/childhood-cancers/hp-stem-cell-transplant/gvhd
txt: Because of the intensity of therapy associated with the transplant process, the pretransplant clinical status of recipients (e.g., age, presence of infections or organ dysfunction, and functional status) is associated with a risk of transplant-related mortality. The best tool to assess the impact of pretransplant comorbidities on outcomes after transplant was developed by adapting an existing comorbidity scale, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).  Investigators at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center systematically defined which of the CCI elements were correlated with transplant-related mortality in adult and pediatric patients.  They also determined several additional comorbidities that have predictive power specific to transplant patients. Successful validation defined what is now termed the hematopoietic cell transplant–specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI).[ , ]  The rate of transplant-related mortality increases with the presence of  cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, infectious, and autoimmune comorbidities, or a history of previous solid tumors (see ). The predictive power of this index for both transplant-related mortality and overall survival (OS) is strong, with a hazard ratio of 3.54 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0–6.3) for nonrelapse mortality and 2.69 (95% CI, 1.8–4.1) for survival for patients with a score of 3 or higher, compared with those who have a score of 0.  Although the original studies were performed with patients receiving intense myeloablative approaches, the HCT-CI has also been shown to predict outcomes for patients receiving reduced-intensity and nonmyeloablative regimens.[ ] It has also been combined with disease status [ ] and Karnofsky score,[ ] leading to even better prediction of survival outcomes. In addition, high HCT-CI scores (>3) have been associated with a higher risk of grades III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease.[ ] Most patients assessed in the HCT-CI studies have been adults, and the comorbidities listed are skewed toward adult diseases.  The relevance of this scale for pediatric and young adult recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has been explored in  several studies. Evidence (use of HCT-CI score in pediatrics): Most of the reported comorbidities in these studies were with respiratory or hepatic conditions and infections.[ , ]  In the adolescent and young adult study, patients with pre-HSCT pulmonary dysfunction were at particularly high risk of comorbidity, with a 2-year OS rate of 29%, compared with 61% in those with normal lung function before HSCT.[ ] Defective immune reconstitution is a major barrier to successful HSCT, regardless of graft source.[ , ] Serious infections have accounted for a significant percentage (4%–20%) of late deaths after HSCT.[ ] Factors that can significantly slow immune recovery include the following:[ ] illustrates the immune defects, contributing transplant-related factors, and types and timing of infections that occur after allogeneic transplant.[ ] Bacterial infections tend to occur in the first few weeks after transplant during the neutropenic phase, when mucosal barriers are damaged from the conditioning regimen. There is significant ongoing research into the role of prophylactic antibacterial medications during the neutropenic phase.[ ] Guidelines for prevention of infections after HSCT have been established by a joint effort of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Disease Society of America, and the American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.[ ] Approaches include preventive or prophylactic antivirals, antifungals, and antibiotics; escalation to heightened empiric therapy for signs of infection; and continued careful monitoring through the full duration of the immunocompromised period after HSCT. Prophylaxis against fungal infections is standard during the first several months after transplant and may be considered for patients with chronic GVHD who are at high risk of fungal infection. Antifungal prophylaxis must be tailored to the patient's underlying immune status. infections can occur in all patients after bone marrow transplants, and prophylaxis is mandatory.[ ]; [ ][ ] After HSCT, viral infections can be a major source of mortality, especially after T-cell–depleted or cord blood procedures.  Types of viral infections include the following: Careful viral monitoring is essential during high-risk allogeneic procedures. Late bacterial infections can occur in patients who have central lines or patients with significant chronic GVHD. These patients are susceptible to infection with encapsulated organisms, particularly . Despite reimmunization, these patients can sometimes develop significant infections, and continued prophylaxis is recommended until a serological response to immunizations has been documented. Occasionally, postallogeneic HSCT patients can become functionally asplenic, and antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended.  Patients should remain on infection prophylaxis (e.g., pneumonia  prophylaxis) until immune recovery.  Time to immune recovery varies but ranges from 3 months to 9 months after autologous HSCT, and 9 months to 24 months after allogeneic HSCT without GVHD.  Patients with active chronic GVHD may have persistent immunosuppression for years.  Many centers monitor T-cell subset recovery after bone marrow transplants as a guide to infection risk.[ ] International transplant and infectious disease groups have developed specific guidelines for the administration of vaccines after autologous and allogeneic transplant.[ , , ]  Comparative studies aimed at defining ideal timing of vaccination after transplant have not been performed, but the vaccine guidelines outlined in result in protective titers in most patients who receive vaccinations. These guidelines recommend that autologous transplant recipients receive immunizations beginning at 6 months after stem cell infusion and receive live vaccines 24 months after the transplant.  Patients undergoing allogeneic procedures can begin immunizations as soon as 6 months after transplant. However, many groups prefer to wait either until 12 months after the procedure for patients who continue to receive immunosuppressive drugs or until patients are no longer receiving immunosuppressants. Vaccination recommendations should be reconsidered at times of local endemic or epidemic disease outbreaks. In those settings, earlier vaccination with killed vaccines may be implemented, acknowledging limited host responses. Pathologically, SOS/VOD of the liver is the result of damage to the hepatic sinusoids, resulting in biliary obstruction.  This syndrome has been estimated to occur in 15% to 40% of pediatric myeloablative transplant patients.[ , ] Risk factors for SOS/VOD include the following:[ , ] SOS/VOD is defined clinically by the following: Life-threatening SOS/VOD generally occurs soon after transplant and is characterized by multiorgan system failure.[ ] Milder, reversible forms can occur, with full recovery expected.  Pediatric patients who have severe SOS/VOD without increased bilirubin have been reported;[ ] therefore, it is important to be vigilant  about monitoring patients who have other symptoms without increased bilirubin. Approaches to both prevention and treatment with agents such as heparin, protein C, and antithrombin III have been studied, with mixed results.[ ] One small, retrospective, single-center study showed a benefit from corticosteroid therapy, but further validation is needed.[ ] Another agent with demonstrated activity is defibrotide, a mixture of oligonucleotides with antithrombotic and fibrinolytic effects on microvascular endothelium.  Studies of defibrotide have shown the following: Defibrotide is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients who have hepatic SOS/VOD with renal or pulmonary dysfunction after HSCT. The British Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (BSBMT) published evidence-guided recommendations for the diagnosis and management of SOS/VOD.[ ] They recommend that biopsy be reserved for difficult cases and be performed using the transjugular approach. The BSBMT supports the use of defibrotide for the prevention of SOS/VOD (defibrotide prophylaxis is not currently part of the FDA indication) but maintains there is insufficient data to support the use of prostaglandin E1, pentoxifylline, or antithrombin. For treatment of SOS/VOD, they recommend aggressive fluid balance management, early involvement of critical care and gastroenterology specialists, and the use of defibrotide and possibly methylprednisolone. However, they concluded there is insufficient evidence to support the use of tissue plasminogen activator or N-acetylcysteine.[ , ] More detailed consensus recommendations for the diagnosis and management of SOS/VOD in children after HSCT have been published by the Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium, which worked with the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators.[ - ] Although TA-TMA clinically mirrors hemolytic uremic syndrome, its causes and clinical course differ from those of other hemolytic uremic syndrome–like diseases. Studies have linked this syndrome with dysregulation of complement pathways.[ ]   TA-TMA has most frequently been associated with the use of the calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and cyclosporine, and it has been noted to occur more frequently when either of these medications is used in combination with sirolimus.[ ] Diagnostic criteria for this syndrome have been standardized and include the following:[ ] Suggestive symptoms consistent with, but not necessary for, the diagnosis include a sudden worsening of renal function or neurologic symptoms. Evidence (impact of TA-TMA on HSCT outcomes): Treatment for TA-TMA includes the following: Prognosis for normalization of kidney function when disease is caused by calcineurin inhibitors alone is generally poor; however, most TA-TMA that is associated with the combination of a calcineurin inhibitor and sirolimus has been reversed after sirolimus is discontinued, and in some cases, after both medications are stopped.[ ] Some evidence suggests a role for complement modulation (c5, eculizumab therapy) in preserving renal function. Further assessment of the role of this medication in treating this complication is ongoing.[ - ] Although there are no randomized or prospective trials that used eculizumab to treat TA-TMA, there are published data from retrospective institutional and multicenter studies. Historically, the 1-year survival rate for untreated patients with TA-TMA was about 20%.[ ] A single-center study showed a 1-year OS rate of 66% with eculizumab treatment.[ ] A multicenter study reported a 6-month OS rate of 47% with eculizumab treatment.[ ] IPS is characterized by diffuse, noninfectious lung injury that occurs from 14 to 90 days after the infusion of donor cells.  Possible etiologies include direct toxic effects of conditioning regimens and occult infection leading to secretion of high levels of inflammatory cytokines into the alveoli.[ ] The incidence of this complication appears to be decreasing, possibly because of less intensive preparative regimens, better HLA matching, and better definition of occult infections through PCR  testing of blood and bronchioalveolar specimens. Mortality rates of 50% to 70% have been reported;[ ] however, these estimates are from the mid-1990s, and outcomes may have improved. Diagnostic criteria include the following signs and symptoms in the absence of documented infectious organisms:[ ] Early assessment by bronchioalveolar lavage to rule out infection is important. The traditional therapy for IPS has been high-dose methylprednisolone and pulmonary support. Etanercept is a soluble fusion protein that joins the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–alpha receptor to the Fc region of the immunoglobulin G1 antibody. It acts by blocking TNF-alpha signaling. The addition of etanercept to steroid therapies has shown promising short-term outcomes (extubation, improved short-term survival) in single-center studies.[ ] A large phase II trial of this approach in pediatric patients showed promising results, with OS rates of 89% at 1 month and 63% at 12 months.[ ] AIC after allogeneic HSCT can be restricted to one cell lineage (e.g., autoimmune hemolytic anemia), two cell lineages, or three cell lineages. Most data about AIC in pediatric patients after HSCT are reported from single-center experiences, with the number of cases ranging from 20 to 30, over a 10- to 20-year period.[ - ] The incidence of AIC is about 5% after allogeneic HSCT. Risk factors for developing AIC seem to be age younger than 10 years and having a nonmalignant disease as an HSCT indication.  At least one study has identified use of serotherapy, use of cord blood as the donor source, and severe GVHD as risk factors, but this finding has not been confirmed in other studies. One study demonstrated that patients who develop AIC have inferior outcomes compared with patients who did not develop AIC.[ ]  However, other studies did not demonstrate an inferior outcome.[ , ] The most common first-line therapy for AIC has been corticosteroids.[ - ]  This treatment is effective in only 15% of patients, and additional immunosuppression or B-cell targeting monoclonal antibodies have been used. Intravenous immunoglobulin is used frequently as adjunct treatment for AIC and/or immunoglobulin replacement. After HSCT, EBV infection incidence increases through childhood, from approximately 40% in children aged 4 years to more than 80% in teenagers.  Patients with a history of previous EBV infection are at risk of EBV reactivation when undergoing HSCT procedures that result in intense, prolonged lymphopenia (T-cell–depleted procedures, use of antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab, and, to a lesser degree, use of cord blood).[ - ] Features of EBV reactivation can vary, from an isolated increase in EBV titers in the bloodstream as measured by PCR to an aggressive monoclonal disease with marked lymphadenopathy presenting as lymphoma (lymphoproliferative disorder). Isolated bloodstream reactivation of EBV can improve in some cases without therapy as immune function improves; however, lymphoproliferative disorder requires more aggressive therapy. Treatment of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder has relied on decreasing immune suppression and treatment with chemotherapy agents such as cyclophosphamide.  CD20-positive EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder and EBV reactivation have been shown to respond to therapy with the CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy rituximab.[ - ]  In addition, some centers have shown efficacy in treating or preventing this complication with therapeutic or prophylactic EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells.[ , ] Improved understanding of the risk of EBV reactivation, early monitoring, and aggressive therapy have significantly decreased the risk of mortality from this challenging complication. GVHD is the result of immunologic activation of donor lymphocytes targeting major or minor HLA disparities present in the tissues of a recipient.[ ]  Acute GVHD usually occurs within the first 3 months posttransplant, although delayed acute GVHD has been noted in reduced-intensity conditioning and nonmyeloablative approaches where achieving a high level of full donor chimerism is sometimes delayed. Typically, acute GVHD presents with at least one of the following three manifestations: Acute GVHD is classified by staging the severity of skin, liver, and gastrointestinal involvement and further combining the individual staging of these three areas into an overall grade that is prognostically significant (see Tables and ).[ ] Patients with grade III or grade IV acute GVHD are at higher risk of mortality, generally resulting from organ system damage caused by infections or progressive acute GVHD that is sometimes resistant to therapy. Because of variation in outcomes of patients with different grades of acute GVHD, investigators have sought to define a more precise determination of acute GVHD risk based on serum biomarkers.  A study that included both adults and children used a score calculated on the basis of the levels of a combination of three biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 [TNFR1], suppression of tumorigenicity 2 [ST2], and regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha [REG3-alpha]) measured at the onset of acute GVHD. Investigators were able to define patients with low (8%), intermediate (27%), and high (46%, < .0001) risk of 6-month mortality.  The biomarker score was more sensitive and specific for predicting survival than clinical staging.[ ] Additional refining of the prediction algorithm showed that measurement of only two biomarkers (ST2 and REG3-alpha) reliably predicted outcome.  In addition, after 4 weeks of therapy, changes in the biomarker score were able to further refine prediction of survival outcomes.[ ] These findings have led to several studies targeting biomarker high-risk or low-risk subsets of patients with acute GVHD and are influencing clinicians regarding the timing and intensity of acute GVHD therapies. Morbidity and mortality from acute GVHD can be reduced through immune suppressive medications given prophylactically or T-cell depletion of grafts, either by actual removal of cells from a graft or with antilymphocyte antibodies (antithymocyte globulin or anti-CD52 [alemtuzumab]). Complete elimination of acute GVHD with intense T-cell depletion has generally resulted in increased relapse, more infectious morbidity, and increased EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder.  Because of this result, most HSCT GVHD prophylaxis attempts to balance risk by giving sufficient immune suppression to prevent severe acute GVHD but not completely remove GVHD risk. Approaches to GVHD prevention in non–T-cell-depleted grafts have included the following:[ , ]; [ ][ ] When significant acute GVHD occurs, first-line therapy is generally methylprednisolone.[ ]  Patients with acute GVHD who are resistant to this therapy have a poor prognosis, but a good percentage of cases respond to second-line agents (e.g., mycophenolate mofetil, infliximab, pentostatin, sirolimus, or extracorporeal photopheresis).[ ]  Ruxolitinib was approved in 2019 for the treatment of children aged 12 years and older with steroid-refractory acute GVHD, with an overall response rate of 55% and a complete response rate of 27% at day 28 after initiation of therapy.  Comparative trials of these agents have not been performed; therefore, a best option for steroid-refractory GVHD has not been identified.[ , ] Chronic GVHD is a syndrome that may involve a single organ system or several organ systems, with clinical features resembling an autoimmune disease.[ , ]  Chronic GVHD is usually first noted 2 to 12 months after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Traditionally, symptoms occurring more than 100 days after HSCT were considered chronic GVHD, and symptoms occurring sooner than 100 days after HSCT were considered acute GVHD.  Because some approaches to HSCT can lead to late-onset acute GVHD, and manifestations that are diagnostic for chronic GVHD can occur sooner than 100 days post-HSCT, the following three distinct types of chronic GVHD have been described: The diagnosis of chronic GVHD is based on clinical features (at least one diagnostic clinical sign, e.g., poikiloderma) or distinctive manifestations complemented by relevant tests (e.g., dry eye with positive results of a Schirmer test).[ ] The tissues that are commonly involved include the skin, eyes, mouth, hair, joints, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Other tissues such as lungs, nails, muscles, urogenital system, and nervous system may also be involved. Tables to list organ manifestations of chronic GVHD, including a description of findings that are sufficient to establish the diagnosis of chronic GVHD.  Biopsies of affected sites may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.[ ] Common skin manifestations include alterations in pigmentation, texture, elasticity, and thickness, with papules, plaques, or follicular changes. Patient-reported symptoms include dry skin, itching, limited mobility, rash, sores, or changes in coloring or texture. Generalized scleroderma may lead to severe joint contractures and debility.  Associated hair loss and nail changes are common.  Other important symptoms that should be assessed include dry eyes and oral changes such as atrophy, ulcers, and lichen planus.  In addition, joint stiffness along with restricted range of motion, weight loss, nausea, difficulty swallowing, and diarrhea should be noted. Chronic GVHD occurs in approximately 15% to 30% of children after sibling-donor HSCT [ ] and in 20% to 45% of children after unrelated-donor HSCT, with a higher risk associated with peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) and a lower risk associated with cord blood and selected approaches to haploidentical HSCT.[ - ] Risk factors for the development of chronic GVHD include the following:[ , , ] Several factors have been associated with increased risk of nonrelapse mortality in children who develop significant chronic GVHD.  Children who received HLA-mismatched grafts, received PBSCs, were older than 10 years, or had platelet counts lower than 100,000/µL at diagnosis of chronic GVHD have an increased risk of nonrelapse mortality. Nonrelapse mortality was 17% at 1 year, 22% at 3 years, and 24% at 5 years after diagnosis of chronic GVHD.  Many of these children required long-term immune suppression.  By 3 years after diagnosis of chronic GVHD, about a third of children had died of either relapse or nonrelapse mortality, a third were off immune suppression, and a third still required some form of immune suppressive therapy.[ ] Older literature describes chronic GVHD as either or .  A National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Workshop in 2006 broadened the description of chronic GVHD to three categories to better predict long-term outcomes.[ ]   The three NIH grading categories are as follows:[ ] Thus, high-risk patients include those with severe disease of any site or extensive involvement of multiple sites, especially those with the following: One study demonstrated a much higher chance of long-term GVHD-free survival and lower treatment-related mortality in children with mild and moderate chronic GVHD than in  children with severe chronic GVHD.  At 8 years, the probability of continued chronic GVHD in children with mild, moderate, and severe chronic GVHD was 4%, 11%, and 36%, respectively.[ ] In another large prospective trial with central review that used the NIH consensus criteria, about 28% of patients were misclassified as having chronic GVHD when they actually had late-acute GVHD.  Additionally, there were significant challenges when using the NIH consensus criteria for bronchiolitis obliterans in children.[ ] Steroids remain the cornerstone of chronic GVHD therapy; however, many approaches have been developed to minimize steroid dosing, including the use of calcineurin inhibitors.[ ]  Topical therapy to affected areas is preferred for patients with limited disease.[ ]  The following agents have been tested with some success: Other approaches, including extracorporeal photopheresis, have been evaluated and show some efficacy in some patients.[ ] Besides significantly  affecting organ function, quality of life, and functional status, infection is the major cause of chronic GVHD–related death.  Therefore, all patients with chronic GVHD receive prophylaxis against pneumonia, common encapsulated organisms, and varicella by using agents such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, penicillin, and acyclovir. Transplant-related complications account for 70% of the deaths in patients with chronic GVHD.[ ]  Guidelines concerning ancillary therapy and supportive care of patients with chronic GVHD have been published.[ , ] The highest incidence of mortality after HSCT occurs in the first 2 years and is mostly caused by relapse.  A study of late mortality (≥2 years posttransplant) in  children with malignancies who underwent HSCT showed that approximately 20% of the 479 patients who were alive at 2 years suffered a late death.  Late mortality in the allogeneic group was 15% (median follow-up, 10.0 years; range, 2.0–25.6 years), mainly caused by relapse (65%). A total of 26% of patients suffered a late death after autologous HSCT (median follow-up, 6.7 years; range, 2.0–22.2 years),[ ] and recurrence of the primary malignancy accounted for 88% of these deaths.  Nonrelapse mortality,   death caused by chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and secondary malignancies are less common in children. Another study reviewed the causes of late mortality after second allogeneic transplant.[ ] Of the children who were alive and relapse free 1 year after a second HSCT, 55% remained alive at 10 years. The most common cause of mortality  between 1 and 10 years after HSCT in this group was relapse (77% of deaths), generally occurring in the first 3 years after transplant. The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality for this cohort at 10 years was 10%. Chronic GVHD occurred in 43% of children in this study and was the leading cause of nonrelapse mortality. A study focused on late mortality after autologous HSCT in children showed that mortality rates remained elevated compared with those of the general population more than 10 years after the procedure, but they approached the rates of the general population at 15 years.  The study also showed a decrease in late mortality in the more current treatment eras (before 1990, 35.1%; 1990–1999, 25.6%; 2000–2010, 21.8%; = .05).[ ] Data from studies of child and adult survivors of HSCT have shown a significant impact of treatment-related exposures on survival and quality of life.[ ]  In one study of patients who were alive 2 years after undergoing HSCT, survivors had a 9.9-fold increased risk of premature death compared with age- and sex-matched controls in the U.S. general population.[ ] Another multicenter study showed that more than one-half of adult survivors who underwent HSCT during childhood would have a grade 3 or 4 chronic health issue. Survivors had an odds ratio (OR) of 15.1 compared with siblings.[ ] Although the main cause of death in patients who have undergone HSCT is from relapse of the primary disease, a sizeable number of these patients die from infections related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), second malignancies, or cardiac or pulmonary issues.[ , - ] In addition, other studies have revealed that up to 40% of HSCT survivors experience severe, disabling, and/or life-threatening events or die because of an adverse event associated with primary or previous cancer treatment.[ , ] Before studies aimed at decreasing the incidence and severity of these effects are initiated, it is important to understand what leads to the development of these complications: Individuals differ in their susceptibility to specific organ damage from chemotherapy or in their risk of GVHD on the basis of genetic differences in both the donor and recipient.[ - ] Although cardiac dysfunction has been studied extensively in non-HSCT settings, less is known about the incidence and predictors of congestive heart failure following HSCT in childhood. Potentially cardiotoxic exposures unique to HSCT include the following:[ ] HSCT survivors are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes, partly as a result of exposure to TBI and  prolonged immunosuppressive therapy after allogeneic HSCT or related to other health conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism or growth hormone deficiency).[ , ] In a study of 661 pediatric patients who survived at least 2 years after allogeneic HSCT, 52% of patients had obesity or were overweight at their most recent examination, 18% of patients had dyslipidemia (associated with pre-HSCT anthracycline or cranial or chest irradiation), and 7% of patients were diagnosed with diabetes.[ ] Rates of cardiovascular outcomes were examined among nearly 1,500 transplant survivors (surviving ≥2 years) who were treated in Seattle from 1985 to 2006. The survivors and a population-based comparison group were matched by age, year, and sex.[ ] Survivors experienced increased rates of cardiovascular death (adjusted incidence rate difference, 3.6 per 1,000 person-years [95% confidence interval, 1.7–5.5]). Survivors also had an increased cumulative incidence of the following: Survivors also had an increased cumulative incidence of related conditions that increased their risk of developing more serious cardiovascular disease (i.e., hypertension, renal disease, dyslipidemia, and diabetes).[ ] In addition, cardiac function and pre-HSCT exposures to chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been shown to significantly impact post-HSCT cardiac function. In evaluating post-HSCT patients for long-term issues, it is important to consider levels of pre-HSCT anthracycline and chest irradiation.[ ] Although more specific studies are needed to verify this approach, current evidence suggests that the risk of late-occurring cardiovascular complications after HSCT may largely result from pre-HSCT therapeutic exposures, with little additional risk from conditioning-related exposures or GVHD.[ , ] For more information, see the section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. A preponderance of studies report normal neurodevelopment after HSCT, with no evidence of decline.[ - ] Researchers from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital have reported on the largest longitudinal cohort to date, describing remarkable stability in global cognitive function and academic achievement during 5 years of posttransplant follow-up.[ - ] This research group reported poorer outcomes in patients who underwent unrelated-donor transplant when the patients received TBI and when they experienced GVHD. But these effects on outcomes were small compared with the much larger effects of socioeconomic status on cognitive function.[ ] Most published studies report similar outcomes.  Normal cognitive function and academic achievement were reported in a cohort of 47 patients monitored prospectively through 2 years post-HSCT.[ ] Stable cognitive function was also noted in a large cohort monitored from pretransplant to 2 years post-HSCT.[ ] A smaller study reported similar normal functioning and the absence of declines over time in HSCT survivors.[ ] HSCT survivors did not differ from their siblings in cognitive and academic function, with the exception that survivors performed better than siblings on measures of perceptual organization.[ ] On the basis of the findings to date, it appears that HSCT poses low-to-minimal risk of late cognitive and academic deficits in survivors. A number of studies, however, have reported some decline in cognitive function after HSCT.[ - ] These studies tended to include samples with a high percentage of very young children. One study reported a significant decline in IQ in their cohort at 1 year post-HSCT, deficits that were maintained at 3 years post-HSCT.[ , ] Similarly, studies from Sweden have reported deficits in visual-spatial domains and executive functioning in very young children who underwent transplant with TBI.[ , ] Another study from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital reported that while all children younger than 3 years had a decline in IQ at 1 year after transplant, patients who did not receive TBI during conditioning recovered later.  Patients who received TBI had a significantly lower IQ at 5 years ( = .05) than did those who did not receive TBI.[ ] For more information, see the section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Most gastrointestinal late effects are related to protracted acute GVHD and chronic GVHD (see ). For more information, see the section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. As GVHD is controlled and tolerance is developed, most symptoms resolve.  Major hepatobiliary concerns include the consequences of viral hepatitis acquired before or during the transplant, biliary stone disease, and focal liver lesions.[ ] Viral serology and polymerase chain reaction should be performed to differentiate these from GVHD presenting with hepatocellular injury.[ ] Iron overload occurs in almost all patients who undergo HSCT, especially if the procedure is for a condition associated with transfusion dependence before HSCT (e.g., thalassemia, bone marrow failure syndromes) or pre-HSCT treatments requiring transfusions after myelotoxic chemotherapy (e.g., acute leukemias).  Inflammatory conditions such as GVHD also increase gastrointestinal iron absorption.  Non-HSCT conditions leading to iron overload can lead to cardiac dysfunction, endocrine disorders (e.g., pituitary insufficiency, hypothyroidism), diabetes, neurocognitive effects, and second malignancies.[ ] The effects of iron overload on morbidity post-HSCT have not been well studied; however, reducing iron levels after HSCT for thalassemia has been shown to improve cardiac function.[ ] Although data supporting iron reduction therapies (such as phlebotomy or chelation after HSCT) have not identified specific levels at which iron reduction should be performed, higher levels of ferritin and/or evidence of significant iron overload by liver biopsy or T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [ ] should be addressed by iron reduction therapy.[ ] Studies show that rates of thyroid dysfunction  in children after myeloablative HSCT vary, with larger series reporting an average incidence of about 30%.[ - ]   A lower incidence in adults (on average, 15%) and a notable increase in incidence in children younger than 10 years who underwent HSCT suggest that a developing thyroid gland may be more susceptible to damage.[ , , , ] Pretransplant local thyroid radiation contributes to high rates of thyroid dysfunction in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.[ ]  Early studies showed very high rates of thyroid dysfunction after high single-dose fractions of TBI,[ ] but traditional fractionated TBI/cyclophosphamide compared with busulfan/cyclophosphamide showed similar rates of thyroid dysfunction, suggesting a role for high-dose chemotherapy in thyroid damage.[ - ]  Notably, one large study showed that patients treated with either TBI or busulfan had similar high rates of thyroid dysfunction, while patients treated with treosulfan or reduced-intensity,  chemotherapy-based regimens had low rates of thyroid disease.[ ] For more information, see the section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Higher rates of thyroid dysfunction occur with single-drug prophylaxis than with three-drug GVHD prophylaxis.[ ] Increased rates of thyroid dysfunction occur after unrelated-donor HSCT than after  related-donor HSCT (36% vs. 9%),[ ] suggesting a role for alloimmune damage in causing thyroid dysfunction.[ , ] Growth impairment is generally multifactorial.  Factors that play a role in failure to achieve expected adult height in young children who have undergone HSCT include the following: The incidence of growth impairment varies from 20% to 80%, depending on age, risk factors, and the definition of growth impairment used by reporting groups.[ , , - ]  Risk factors include the following:[ , , , ] Patients younger than 10 years at the time of HSCT are at the highest risk of growth impairment, but they also respond best to growth hormone replacement therapy. Early screening and referral of patients with signs of growth impairment to endocrinology specialists can result in significant restoration of height in younger children.[ ] For more information, see the section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. After HSCT, adult survivors have a 2.3-fold higher risk of premature cardiovascular-related death compared with the general population.[ , ] The exact etiology of cardiovascular risk and subsequent death is largely unknown, although the development of (a constellation of central obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension), especially insulin resistance, as a consequence of HSCT has been suggested.[ - ] In studies of conventionally treated leukemia survivors compared with those who underwent HSCT, transplant survivors are significantly more likely to manifest metabolic syndrome or multiple adverse cardiac risk factors, including central adiposity, hypertension, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia.[ , , ]  The concern over time is that survivors who develop metabolic syndrome after HSCT will be at higher risk of significant cardiovascular-related events and/or premature death from cardiovascular-related causes. For more information, see the section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. The association of obesity with diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk in the general population is well established, but obesity as determined by body mass index (BMI) is uncommon in long-term survivors after HSCT.[ ]  However, despite having a normal BMI, HSCT survivors develop significantly altered body composition that results in both an increase in total percent fat mass and a reduction in lean body mass.  This finding, termed , results in a loss of myocyte insulin receptors and an increase in adipocyte insulin receptors; the latter are less efficient in binding insulin and clearing glucose, ultimately contributing to insulin resistance.[ - ] Preliminary data from 119 children and young adult survivors and  81 healthy sibling controls found that HSCT survivors had significantly lower weight but no differences in BMI or waist circumference when compared with siblings.[ ] HSCT survivors had a significantly higher percent fat mass and lower lean body mass than did controls. HSCT survivors were significantly more insulin resistant than were controls, and they also had a higher incidence of other cardiovascular risk factors, such as elevated total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. These differences were found only in patients who had received TBI as part of their transplant conditioning regimen. A limited number of studies have addressed low bone mineral density after HSCT in children.[ - ]  A significant portion of children experienced reduction in total-body bone mineral density  or lumbar Z-scores showing osteopenia (18%–33%) or osteoporosis (6%–21%).  Although general risk factors have been described (female sex, inactivity, poor nutritional status, White  or Asian ethnicity, family history, TBI, craniospinal irradiation, corticosteroid therapy, GVHD, cyclosporine, and endocrine deficiencies [e.g., growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism]), most reported populations have been too small for multivariate analysis to test the relative importance of each factor.[ - ] Some studies in adults have shown improvement over time in low bone mineral density after HSCT;[ , , ]  however, this has yet to be shown in children. Treatment for children has generally included a multifactorial approach, with vitamin D and calcium supplementation, minimization of corticosteroid therapy, participation in weight-bearing exercise, and resolution of other endocrine problems.  The role of bisphosphonate therapy in children with this condition is unclear. For more information, see the section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Reported incidence of osteonecrosis  in children after HSCT has been 1% to 14%; however, these studies were retrospective and underestimated actual incidence because patients may have been asymptomatic early in the course of the disease.[ - ]  Two prospective studies showed an incidence of 30% and 44% with routine MRI screening of possible target joints.[ , ]  Osteonecrosis generally occurs within 3 years after HSCT, with a median onset of about 1 year. The most common locations include knees (30%–40%), hips (19%–24%), and shoulders (9%).  Most patients experience osteonecrosis in two or more joints.[ , , , ] In one prospective report, risk factors by multivariate analysis included age (markedly increased in children older than 10 years; OR,  7.4) and presence of osteonecrosis at the time of transplant. It is important to note that pre-HSCT factors such as corticosteroid exposure are very important in determining patient risk.  In this study, 14 of 44 children who developed osteonecrosis had the disease before HSCT.[ ] A Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) retrospective nested control study of 160 cases and 478 control children suggested older age (>5 years), female sex, and the presence of chronic GVHD as risk factors for developing osteonecrosis.[ ] Treatment has generally consisted of minimization of corticosteroid therapy and surgical joint replacement.  Most patients are not diagnosed until they present with symptoms.  In one study of 44 patients with osteonecrosis lesions in whom routine yearly MRI was performed, 4 resolved completely and 2 had resolution of one of multiply involved joints.[ ]  The observation that some lesions can heal over time suggests caution in the surgical management of asymptomatic lesions. For more information, see the section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Delayed, absent, or incomplete pubertal development commonly occurs after HSCT. Two studies showed pubertal delay or failure in 16% of female children who received cyclophosphamide alone, 72% of those who received busulfan/cyclophosphamide, and 57% of  those who underwent fractionated TBI. In males, incomplete pubertal development or failure was noted in 14% of those who received cyclophosphamide alone, 48% of those who received busulfan/cyclophosphamide, and 58% of those who underwent TBI.[ , ]  Boys who received more than 24 Gy of radiation to the testicles developed azoospermia and also experienced failure of testosterone production, requiring supplementation to develop secondary sexual characteristics.[ ] Pretransplant and transplant cyclophosphamide exposure is the best-studied agent affecting fertility.  Postpubertal women younger than 30 years can tolerate up to 20 g/m of cyclophosphamide and have preserved ovarian function; prepubertal females can tolerate as much as 25 g/m to 30 g/m .  Although the additional effect added by pretransplant exposures to cyclophosphamide and other agents has not been specifically quantitated in studies, these exposures plus transplant-related chemotherapy and radiation therapy lead to ovarian failure in 65% to 84% of females undergoing myeloablative HSCT.[ - ]  The use of cyclophosphamide, busulfan, and TBI as part of the preparative regimen are associated with worse ovarian function.  Younger age at the time of HSCT is associated with a higher chance of menarche and ovulation.[ , ] For more information, see the section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Studies of pregnancy are challenging because data seldom indicate whether individuals are trying to conceive.  Nonetheless, a large study of pregnancy in pediatric and adult survivors of myeloablative transplant demonstrated conception in 32 of 708 patients (4.5%).[ ]  Of those trying to conceive, patients exposed to cyclophosphamide alone (total dose 6.7 g/m with no pretransplant exposure) had the best chance of conception (56 of 103, 54%), while those receiving myeloablative busulfan/cyclophosphamide (0 of 73, 0%) or TBI (7 of 532, 1.3%) had much lower rates of conception. The ability of men to produce functional sperm decreases with exposure to higher doses and specific types of chemotherapy.  Most men will become azoospermic at a cyclophosphamide dose of 300 mg/kg.[ ]  After HSCT, 48% to 85% of men will experience gonadal failure.[ , , ]  One study showed that men who received cyclophosphamide  conceived only 24% of the time, compared with 6.5% of men who received busulfan/cyclophosphamide and 1.3% of those who underwent TBI.[ ] For more information, see the section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. On the basis of clear evidence of dose effect and the lowered gonadotoxicity of some reduced-toxicity chemotherapy regimens, the use of reduced-intensity, reduced-toxicity, or nonmyeloablative regimens will likely lead to a higher chance of preserved fertility after HSCT. Because use of these regimens is relatively new and mostly confined to older or sicker patients, most reports have consisted of single cases.  Registry reports are beginning to describe pregnancies after these procedures.[ ] In addition, a single-center study compared myeloablative busulfan/cyclophosphamide with reduced-intensity fludarabine/melphalan.[ ][ ] Spontaneous puberty occurred in 56% of girls and 89% of boys after busulfan/cyclophosphamide, whereas 90% of girls and all of the boys in the fludarabine/melphalan group entered puberty spontaneously ( = .012). Significantly more girls (61%) conditioned with busulfan/cyclophosphamide required hormone replacement than did girls in the fludarabine/melphalan group (10.5%; = .012). In boys, no difference was noted between the two conditioning groups in time to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) elevation (median, 4 years in the fludarabine/melphalan group vs. 6 years in the busulfan/cyclophosphamide group). While the two regimens have similar effects on testicular function, ovarian function seems to be better preserved in girls undergoing HSCT with reduced-intensity conditioning approaches. A second study compared serum concentrations of antimüllerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B in 121 children who survived more than 1 year following a single HSCT and received a treosulfan-based regimen (treosulfan; low-toxicity), a fludarabine/melphalan regimen (Flu/Mel; reduced-intensity), or a busulphan/cyclophosphamide regimen (Bu/Cy; myeloablative). Mean age at HSCT was 3.6 years;  mean age at follow-up was 11.8 years. Mean length of follow-up was 9.9 years. Mean AMH standard deviation scores (SDS) were significantly higher after treosulfan (-1.047) and Flu/Mel (-1.255) than after Bu/Cy (-1.543), suggesting less ovarian reserve impairment after treosulfan and Flu/Mel than after Bu/Cy. Mean serum AMH concentration was significantly better with treosulfan (>1.0 μg/l) than with Flu/Mel or Bu/Cy. In males, mean inhibin B SDS was significantly higher after treosulfan (-0.506) than after Flu/Mel (-2.53) or some Bu/Cy (-1.23).  The authors concluded that treosulfan-based regimens may confer a more favorable outlook for gonadal reserve in both sexes than Flu/Mel or Bu/Cy regimens.[ ] A third study compared gonadal function markers after myeloablative conditioning with Bu/Cy and cyclophosphamide/TBI regimens with a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen using fludarabine/melphalan/alemtuzumab.[ ] The following two forms of chronic pulmonary dysfunction are observed after HSCT:[ - ] The incidence of both forms of lung toxicity can range from 10% to 40%, depending on donor source, the time interval after HSCT, definition applied, and presence of chronic GVHD. In both conditions, collagen deposition and the development of fibrosis in either the interstitial space (restrictive lung disease) or the peribronchiolar space (obstructive lung disease) are believed to underlie the pathology.[ ] The most common form of obstructive lung disease after allogeneic HSCT is bronchiolitis obliterans.[ , , , ] This condition is an inflammatory process resulting in bronchiolar obliteration, fibrosis, and progressive obstructive lung disease.[ ] Historically, the term has been used to describe and begins 6 to 20 months after HSCT. Pulmonary function tests show obstructive lung disease with general preservation of forced vital capacity (FVC), reductions in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and associated decreases in the FEV1/FVC ratio with or without significant declines in the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Risk factors for bronchiolitis obliterans include the following:[ , ] The clinical course of bronchiolitis obliterans is variable, but patients frequently develop progressive and debilitating respiratory failure despite the initiation of enhanced immunosuppression. Standard treatment for obstructive lung disease combines enhanced immunosuppression with supportive care, including antimicrobial prophylaxis, bronchodilator therapy, and supplemental oxygen, when indicated.[ ] The potential role for tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the pathogenesis of obstructive lung disease suggests that neutralizing agents such as etanercept may have promise.[ ] Restrictive lung disease is defined by reductions in FVC, total lung capacity (TLC), and DLCO. In contrast to obstructive lung disease, the FEV1/FVC ratio is maintained near 100%. Restrictive lung disease is common after HSCT and has been reported in 25% to 45% of patients by day 100.[ ] Importantly, declines in TLC or FVC occurring at 100 days and 1 year after HSCT are associated with an increase in nonrelapse mortality. Early reports suggested that the incidence of restrictive lung disease increases with advancing recipient age, but subsequent studies have revealed significant restrictive lung disease in children receiving HSCT.[ ] The most recognizable form of restrictive lung disease is bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), more recently called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP). Clinical features include dry cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Radiographic findings show diffuse, peripheral, fluffy infiltrates consistent with airspace consolidation. Although reported in fewer than 10% of HSCT recipients, the development of BOOP/COP is strongly associated with previous acute and chronic GVHD.[ ] Patients with restrictive lung disease have limited responses to multiple agents such as corticosteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and azathioprine.[ ] The potential role for tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the pathogenesis of restrictive lung disease suggests that neutralizing agents such as etanercept may have promise.[ ] For more information, see the section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Chronic kidney disease is frequently diagnosed after transplant. There are many clinical forms of chronic kidney disease, but the most commonly described ones include thrombotic microangiopathy, nephrotic syndrome, calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, acute kidney injury, and GVHD-related chronic kidney disease.  Various risk factors associated with the development of chronic kidney disease have been described; however, recent studies suggest that acute and chronic GVHD may be a proximal cause of renal injury.[ ] In a systematic review of 9,317 adults and children from 28 cohorts who underwent HSCT, approximately 16.6% of patients (range, 3.6% to 89%) developed chronic kidney disease, defined as a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 24.5 mL/min/1.73 m within the first year after transplant.[ ] The cumulative incidence of chronic kidney disease developing approximately 5 years after transplant ranged from 4.4% to 44.3%, depending on the type of transplant and stage of chronic kidney disease.[ , ] Mortality rates among patients with chronic kidney disease in this setting were higher than those in transplant recipients who retained normal renal function, even when studies controlled for comorbidities.[ ] It is important to aggressively treat hypertension in patients post-HSCT, especially in those treated with prolonged courses of calcineurin inhibitors.  Whether post-HSCT patients with albuminuria and hypertension benefit from treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers requires further study, but careful control of hypertension with captopril, an ACE inhibitor, did show a benefit in a small study.[ ] HRQL is a multidimensional construct, incorporating a subjective appraisal of one’s functioning and well-being, with reference to the impact of health issues on overall quality of life.[ , ] Many studies have shown that HRQL varies according to the following:[ ] Pre-HSCT factors, such as family cohesion and a child’s adaptive functioning, have been shown to affect HRQL.[ ] Several groups have also identified the importance of pre-HSCT parenting stress on parental ratings of children’s HRQL post-HSCT.[ - ] A report of the trajectories of HRQL over the 12 months after HSCT noted that the poorest HRQL was seen at 3 months post-HSCT, with steady improvement thereafter. Recipients of unrelated-donor transplants had the steepest declines in HRQL from baseline to 3 months. Another study reported that compromised emotional functioning, high levels of worry, and reduced communication during the acute recovery period had a negative impact on HRQL at 1-year post-HSCT.[ ] Longitudinal studies identified an association of the following additional baseline risk factors with the trajectory of HRQL after HSCT: A report that investigated the impact of specific HSCT complications indicated that HRQL was worse among children with severe end-organ toxicity, systemic infection, or GVHD.[ ]  Cross-sectional studies reported that the HRQL among pediatric HSCT survivors of 5 years or longer was reasonably good, although psychological, cognitive, or physical problems appeared to negatively influence HRQL. Female sex, causal diagnosis for HSCT (e.g., acute myelogenous leukemia patients had worse HRQL), and intensity of pre-HSCT therapy were all identified as affecting HRQL post-HSCT.[ , ] Finally, another cross-sectional study of children 5 to 10 years post-HSCT cautioned that parental concerns about the child’s vulnerability may induce overprotective parenting.[ ] Clinician reports of long-term disability among childhood HSCT survivors suggest that the prevalence and severity of functional loss is low, as described in the following studies: Self-reported and proxy data among survivors of childhood HSCT indicated similar low rates of functional loss in the following studies: Other studies that have reported functional limitations include the following: Objective measurements of function in the pediatric HSCT patient and survivor population hint that loss of physical capacity may be a bigger problem than revealed in studies that rely on clinician or self-report data.  Studies measuring cardiopulmonary fitness have observed the following: The BMTSS found associations between poor physical performance outcomes and chronic GVHD, cardiac conditions, immune suppression, or treatment for a second malignant neoplasm.[ ]  In a study from the Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center, poor performance was associated with myeloid disease.[ ] Several organizations have published consensus guidelines for follow-up for late effects after HSCT.  The CIBMTR, along with the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplant (ASBMT), and in cooperation with five other international transplant groups, published consensus recommendations for screening and preventive practices for long-term survivors of HSCT.[ ] Although some pediatric-specific challenges are addressed in these guidelines, many important pediatric issues are not.  Some of these issues have been partially covered by general guidelines published by the (COG) and other children’s cancer groups ( , , and ). The COG has also published more specific recommendations for late effects surveillance after HSCT.[ ]  To address the lack of detailed, pediatric-specific, late-effects data and guidelines for long-term follow-up after HSCT, the Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium (PBMTC) published six detailed papers outlining existing data and summarizing recommendations from key groups (CIBMTR/ASBMT, COG, and the United Kingdom), along with expert recommendations for pediatric-specific issues.[ , , , - ] Although international efforts at further standardization and harmonization of pediatric-specific follow-up guidelines are under way, the PBMTC summary and guideline recommendations provide the most current outline for monitoring children for late effects after HSCT.[ ] The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as new information becomes available. This section describes the latest changes made to this summary as of the date above. Added to state that a second study was closed due to a lack of efficacy, bringing the validity of prophylactic defibrotide use into question (cited Grupp et al. as reference 27). Added to state that although there are no randomized or prospective trials that used eculizumab for transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA), there are published data from retrospective institutional and multicenter studies. Historically, the 1-year survival rate for untreated patients with TA-TMA was about 20%. A single-center study showed a 1-year overall survival (OS) rate of 66% with eculizumab treatment (cited Jodele et al. as reference 39).

ttle: Childhood Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors Treatment (PDQ®) - NCI
@: https://www.cancer.gov/types/extracranial-germ-cell/hp/germ-cell-treatment-pdq
txt: GCTs arise from primordial germ cells, which migrate during embryogenesis from the yolk sac through the mesentery to the gonads (see ).[ , ] Childhood extracranial GCTs   can generally be divided into gonadal and extragonadal. These tumors can also be broadly classified as teratomas, malignant GCTs, or mixed GCTs. Childhood GCTs are rare in children younger than 15
years, accounting for   approximately 3% of cancers in this age
group.[ - ] In the fetal/neonatal age group, most extracranial GCTs are benign teratomas occurring at midline locations, including the head and neck, sacrococcyx, and retroperitoneum.[ , ]  Despite the small percentage of malignant teratomas that occur in this age group,  perinatal tumors have a high morbidity rate caused by hydrops fetalis and premature delivery.[ - ] The incidence of malignant extracranial GCTs increases with the onset of puberty. These tumors   represent approximately 15% of cancers in male adolescents aged 15 to 19 years and 4% of cancers in female adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[ ] shows the age-incidence profile by sex for malignant extracranial/extragonadal  GCTs (left panel) and malignant gonadal GCTs (right panel) between  2014 and 2018 for 23 U.S. Cancer registries that represent 66% of all U.S. children, adolescents, and young adults (blue triangles, females; green triangles, males).[ ] For males, there is a peak in incidence in children younger than 2 years for both extragonadal and gonadal sites, which is followed by low rates between the ages of 2 and 12 years, and then higher rates throughout adolescence. For females, the peak in young children is present only for extragonadal tumors, with rates increasing after the age of puberty for both extragonadal and gonadal sites. However, the incidence of  each tumor is lower for females during adolescence than for males during adolescence. The incidence of extracranial GCTs according to age group, sex, and gonadal versus extragonadal primary site is shown in .[ ] Cryptorchidism, the presence of an abdominal undescended testis, has been associated with a 10.8-fold increased risk of developing a GCT.[ ] Gonadal dysgenesis, as well as the presence of Y-chromosome material in an abdominal gonad, also increases the risk of developing a gonadal GCT, especially gonadoblastoma. Gonadoblastoma is a rare gonadal tumor consisting of a mixture of germ cells and sex-cord stromal derivatives resembling immature granulosa and Sertoli cells.[ , ] There are few data about the potential genetic or environmental risk factors
associated with childhood extragonadal extracranial GCTs.  Patients with
the following syndromes are at an increased risk of extragonadal extracranial GCTs: Most mediastinal GCTs in adolescents and young adults occur in males, and 22% to 50% have cytogenetic changes consistent with Klinefelter syndrome.[ , ] The age of  tumor presentation is younger in patients with Klinefelter syndrome, and testing all younger males for Klinefelter syndrome should be considered.[ , ] Patients with GCTs were identified from the Children's Oncology Group (COG) Childhood Cancer Research Network.  Twenty-nine patients in the study had mediastinal primary tumors, and nine patients (31%) had Klinefelter syndrome. In the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's large 2013 WONDER database, 3% of patients with GCTs had Klinefelter syndrome  (70% were mediastinal). In comparison, 0.2% of males in the general population have Klinefelter syndrome.[ ] Childhood extracranial GCTs comprise a variety of histological
diagnoses and can be broadly classified as the following: The histological properties of extracranial GCTs are heterogeneous and vary by primary tumor site and the sex and age of the patient.[ , ] Histologically identical GCTs that arise in younger children have different biological characteristics from those that arise in adolescents and young adults.[ ] Mature teratomas can occur at gonadal or at extragonadal locations. They are the most common histological subtype of childhood GCT.[ , - ]  Mature teratomas usually contain well-differentiated tissues from the ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal germ cell layers. Any tissue type may be found within this tumor. Mature teratomas are benign, although some mature teratomas may secrete enzymes or hormones, including insulin, growth hormone, androgens, and prolactin.[ , ] Immature teratomas contain tissues from the ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal germ cell layers. Immature tissues, primarily neuroepithelial, are also present.  Immature teratomas are graded from 0 to 3 on the basis of the amount of immature neural tissue found in the tumor specimen.[ , ] Tumors of higher grade are more likely to have foci of yolk sac tumor.[ ] Immature teratomas can exhibit malignant behavior and metastasize. Immature teratomas occur primarily in young children at extragonadal sites and in the ovaries of girls near the age of puberty. However, there is no correlation between tumor grade and patient age.[ , ] Some immature teratomas may secrete enzymes or hormones such as vasopressin.[ ] Most childhood extragonadal GCTs arise in midline sites (i.e., head and neck, sacrococcygeal, mediastinal, and retroperitoneal). The midline location may represent aberrant embryonic migration of the primordial germ cells. GCTs contain malignant tissues of germ cell origin and, rarely, tissues of somatic origin.  Isolated malignant elements may constitute a small fraction of a predominantly mature or immature teratoma.[ , ] Malignant germ cell elements of children, adolescents, and young adults can be grouped broadly by location (see ). Childhood extracranial GCTs develop at many sites, including testicles, ovaries, mediastinum, retroperitoneum, sacrum, coccyx, and head and neck (see ).[ ] The clinical features at presentation are specific for each site. The following biologically distinct subtypes of GCTs are found in children and adolescents: Biological distinctions between GCTs in children and GCTs in adults may not be absolute, and biological factors have not been shown to predict risk.[ - ] Ovarian GCTs occur primarily in adolescent and young adult females. While most ovarian GCTs are benign mature teratomas (dermoid cysts), a heterogeneous group of malignant GCTs, including immature teratomas, dysgerminomas, yolk sac tumors, and mixed GCTs, do occur in females.    The malignant ovarian GCT commonly shows increased copies of the short arm of chromosome 12.[ ] Extragonadal extracranial GCTs occur outside of the brain and gonads. For information about the treatment of intracranial GCTs, see . Diagnostic evaluation of GCTs includes measurement of serum tumor markers and imaging studies. In suspected cases, tumor markers can suggest the diagnosis before surgery and/or biopsy. This information can be used by the multidisciplinary team to make appropriate treatment choices. Tumor markers are measured with each cycle of chemotherapy for all pediatric patients with malignant GCTs. After initial chemotherapy, tumor markers may show a transient  elevation.[ ] Common tumor markers include the following: The fetal liver produces AFP, and during the first year of life, infants have elevated serum  AFP levels, which are not associated with the presence of a GCT. Normal ranges have been described.[ , ] The serum half-life of AFP is 5 to 7 days. Yolk sac tumors produce AFP. Most children with malignant GCTs will have a component of yolk sac tumor and have elevations of AFP levels,[ , ] which are serially monitored during treatment to help assess response to therapy.[ , , ] Benign teratomas and immature teratomas may produce small elevations of AFP and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin  (beta-hCG). A COG study measured AFP levels in children who received chemotherapy for GCTs. AFP decline was defined as automatically satisfactory if AFP normalized after two cycles of chemotherapy and was calculated satisfactory if the AFP half-life decline was less than or equal to 7 days after the start of chemotherapy. Other decline in AFP was defined as unsatisfactory.[ ][ ] Beta-hCG is produced by all choriocarcinomas and by some germinomas (seminomas and dysgerminomas) and embryonal carcinomas, resulting in elevated serum levels of these substances. The  serum half-life of beta-hCG is 1 to 2 days. In a prospective multicentric study, the serum level of microRNA-371a-3p was shown to be a sensitive and specific  biomarker for adult testicular GCTs.[ ] The study included 616 patients with GCTs of varying histologies and 258 controls without malignant GCTs. Elevation of microRNA-371a-3p levels was noted in all malignant histologies, including seminomas. Normal controls and patients with benign teratomas did not have the biomarker elevation. MicroRNA-371a-3p levels were related to tumor volume, and the levels decreased in response to chemotherapy. More studies about microRNA-371a-3p are needed to assess its use in patients with pediatric GCTs. Imaging tests may include the following: Prognostic factors for extracranial GCTs depend on many patient and tumor characteristics and include the following (obtained  from historical national GCT trials):[ , - ] To better identify prognostic factors, data from five U.S. trials and two U.K. trials for malignant extracranial GCTs in children and adolescents were merged by the Malignant Germ Cell Tumor International Collaborative.  The goal was to ascertain the important prognostic factors in 519 young patients who received chemotherapy, incorporating age at diagnosis, stage, and site of primary tumor, along with pretreatment AFP level and histology.[ ][ ] In this age-focused investigation of these factors in young children and adolescents, outcomes included the following (see ):[ ] A subsequent study used a database of 11 GCT trials and identified 593 patients with metastatic testicular, mediastinal, or retroperitoneal GCTs. The distribution of patients by age groups included 90 children (aged 0 to <11 years), 109 adolescents (aged 11 to <18 years), and 394 young adults (aged 18 to ≤30 years).[ ]; [ ][ ] Although few pediatric data exist, adult studies have shown that an unsatisfactory decline of elevated tumor markers after the first cycle of chemotherapy is a poor prognostic finding.[ , ] The presence of gonadal dysgenesis in patients with ovarian nondysgerminomas is associated with worse outcomes. In a report from the COG study, seven patients with gonadal dysgenesis and ovarian nondysgerminomas had  an estimated 3-year EFS rate of 67%, compared with  89% for 100 patients with nondysgerminoma ovarian tumors  who did not have gonadal dysgenesis.[ ] These dysgenetic gonads contain Y-chromosome material, and intra-abdominal gonads with Y-chromosome material are at increased risk of tumor development.[ , ] In contrast to nondysgerminomas, gonadal dysgenesis was identified in 7 of 48 patients  with ovarian dysgerminomas in a report from the French Society of Pediatric Oncology. With a medium follow-up of 14 years, all patients survived.[ ] For more information about prognosis and prognostic factors for childhood extragonadal extracranial GCTs, see the sections on , , and . The following tests and procedures may be performed at the physician's discretion for monitoring children with extracranial GCTs: A COG trial of patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk GCTs reported the following results:[ ][ ] Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer.[ ] Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[ , , ] During the period from 2002 to 2010, cancer mortality continued to decrease by 2.4% per year for children and adolescents with gonadal tumors, as compared with the period from 1975 to 1998 (plateauing from 1998 to 2001).[ ]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because late effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects of childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see . As with other childhood solid tumors, stage of disease at diagnosis directly impacts the outcome of
patients with malignant germ cell tumors (GCTs).[ - ]  The most commonly used staging
systems in the United States are as follows:[ ] describes the testicular GCT staging for males younger than 11 years from the COG trial. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection has not been required in pediatric germ cell trials to stage disease in males younger than 15 years.  Data on adolescent males with testicular GCTs are limited.  Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is used for both staging and treatment in adult testicular GCT trials.[ ] In males older than 15 years, there are only stage I tumors and metastatic tumors. Metastatic tumors are assigned risk according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification.[ ] For more information about the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging criteria for testicular GCT in males aged 11 years and older, see . describes the ovarian GCT staging for females younger than 11 years from the COG trial. Another ovarian GCT staging system used frequently by gynecologic oncologists is the
FIGO staging system, which
is based on adequate surgical staging at the time of diagnosis.[ ] This
system has also been used by some pediatric centers,[ ] is most applicable to females older than 11 years, and is  described in . For more information about the FIGO staging system, see . The ovarian staging systems described above require adherence to specific surgical guidelines. However, in a pediatric intergroup trial, guidelines were followed in only 2 of 131 patients with ovarian tumors.[ ]  In a single-institution retrospective study, guidelines were followed in only 2 of 44 patients with ovarian tumors.[ ] describes the extragonadal extracranial GCT staging from the COG trial. Childhood extracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) are very heterogenous. On the basis of clinical factors and tumor histology, appropriate treatment for extracranial GCTs may involve one of the following: To maximize long-term survival while minimizing treatment-related long-term sequelae (e.g., secondary leukemias, infertility, hearing loss, and renal dysfunction), children with extracranial malignant GCTs need to be cared for at pediatric cancer centers with experience treating these rare tumors. provides an
overview of treatment options for children with extracranial GCTs.  Specific details of treatment by primary site and clinical condition are described in subsequent sections. The treatment of GCTs with other non-GCT somatic elements is complex, and few data exist to direct treatment.  In adolescents, central primitive neuroectodermal tumors and sarcomas have been found in teratomas.[ , ] The Italian Pediatric Germ Cell Tumor group identified 14 patients with malignant GCTs with a somatic malignancy, such as neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma, embedded in teratomas (<2% of extracranial GCTs).[ ] The optimal treatment strategy for GCTs with non-GCT elements  has not been determined. Separate treatments for both malignant GCTs and non-GCT elements may be required. Surgery is an essential component of treatment. Specific treatments will be discussed for each tumor type. For patients with completely resected immature teratomas of all grades and at any location, and for patients with localized, completely resected (stage I) seminomatous and nonseminomatous GCTs (testicular and ovarian), additional therapy may not be necessary. However, close monitoring of patients is important.[ , ] The watch-and-wait approach requires scheduled serial physical examination, tumor marker determination, and primary tumor imaging to ensure that a recurrent tumor is detected without delay. In the United States, the standard chemotherapy regimen for both adults and children with malignant nonseminomatous GCTs includes cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Adult patients receive weekly bleomycin throughout treatment (bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin [BEP]).[ - ] U.S. pediatric trials included patients aged 15 years and younger with testicular GCTs and patients aged 21 years and younger with ovarian and extragonadal GCTs. Patients received bleomycin only on day 1 of each cycle (cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin [PEb]).[ , ]   The combination of carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (JEb) underwent clinical investigation in the United Kingdom in children younger than 16 years. Treatment with this regimen produced event-free survival (EFS) rates by site and stage similar to those produced using treatment with PEb.[ , ]; [ ][ ] For information about adult BEP and pediatric PEb and JEb chemotherapy dosing schedules, see .[ , - , ] In both adult and pediatric trials, the number of adolescent subjects was small. The optimal therapy for adolescents (aged ≥11 years) is not clear.[ ] The use of JEb appears to be associated with fewer otologic toxic effects and renal toxic effects than does the use of PEb.[ ]   In a retrospective meta-analysis of data from the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) and the Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group germ cell studies conducted contemporaneously, the multivariate cure model showed no difference in 4-year EFS rates. The 4-year EFS rate was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83%–89%) for patients who received the cisplatin regimen (n = 620) and 86% (95% CI, 79%–90%) for patients who received the carboplatin regimen (n = 163) ( = .87).[ ][ ] However, PEb and JEb have not been compared in a randomized pediatric GCT trial. Several trials were conducted by the COG (previously the Children's Cancer Group and the Pediatric Oncology Group).[ , , ] These trials explored the use of PEb for the treatment of localized gonadal GCT [ ] and intensified regimens for patients with poor-risk features. The strategies included high-dose cisplatin (200 mg/m ) 
and cyclophosphamide or the protective agent amifostine.[ , ] None of these strategies had a significant effect on survival or decreased toxicity. The COG conducted a trial of compressed and reduced PEb chemotherapy (three cycles in 3 days) for patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk malignant GCTs. This study was designed as a noninferior trial with a value of .1. The 4-year EFS rate of 89%  was significantly lower than  the rate for the historical control  model (92%; = .08).[ ] However, the number of patients in each stratum was small, and further investigation in patients with lower-stage disease may be warranted. Testicular and mediastinal seminomas in males and ovarian dysgerminomas in females are sensitive to radiation, but radiation therapy is rarely recommended because of the known late effects. Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[ ]  Children and
adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a
multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the
cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills of the following health care professionals and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation that will achieve optimal survival and quality of life: The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of
pediatric patients with cancer.[ ]  At these pediatric cancer centers, clinical trials are
available for most of the cancer types that occur in children and
adolescents, and the opportunity to participate is offered to
most patients and families.  Clinical trials for children and adolescents with
cancer are generally designed to compare potentially better therapy with
current standard therapy.  Most of the progress
made in identifying curative therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved
through clinical trials.  Information about ongoing clinical trials is
available from the . Mature and immature teratomas arise primarily in the sacrococcygeal region of neonates and young children and in the ovaries of pubescent girls. Less commonly, these tumors are found in the testicular region of boys younger than 4 years, the mediastinum of adolescents, and other sites.[ - ] The primary treatment for teratomas is surgery with complete resection. Surgical options for sacrococcygeal teratomas are complex. Benign head and neck teratomas and immature teratomas can cause morbidity and mortality through obstruction. In preterm infants and neonates, head and neck teratomas and immature teratomas can cause significant airway compromise. In a single-institutional report, airway obstruction was overcome by using the ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure.[ ] Complete resection of a teratoma can be achieved. The sacrococcygeal region is the primary tumor site for most benign and malignant germ cell tumors (GCTs) diagnosed in neonates, infants, and children younger than 4 years.  These tumors occur more often in girls than in boys; ratios of 3:1 to 4:1 have been reported.[ ] Sacrococcygeal tumors present in the following two clinical patterns related to the child’s age, tumor location, and likelihood of tumor malignancy:[ ] The older the child at presentation, the more likely a malignant component is present in addition to the teratoma. An early survey found that the rate of tumor malignancy was 48% for girls and 67% for boys older than 2 months at the time of sacrococcygeal tumor diagnosis, compared with a malignant tumor incidence of 7% for girls and 10% for boys younger than 2 months at the time of diagnosis.[ ]  The pelvic primary tumor site has been reported to be an adverse prognostic factor. This could be due to a delayed diagnosis because it was overlooked at birth or incomplete resection at the time of original surgery.[ - ] Standard treatment options for mature teratomas in a sacrococcygeal site include the following: Surgery is an essential component of treatment. Complete resection of the coccyx is vital to minimize the likelihood of tumor recurrence.[ ] Standard treatment options for mature teratomas in a nonsacrococcygeal site include the following: Children with mature teratomas, including mature teratomas of the mediastinum, can be treated with surgery and observation and have an excellent prognosis.[ , ] In a review of 153 children with nontesticular mature teratomas, the 6-year relapse-free survival rate was 96% for patients with completely resected disease and 55% for patients with incompletely resected disease.[ ] Another series included 57 girls with mature teratomas of the ovary. Two patients experienced tumor recurrences (8 and 12 months after ovarian-sparing surgery), and seven patients developed metachronous tumors (as late as 79 months after initial diagnosis).[ ][ ] A multidisciplinary team should treat and monitor neonates with head and neck GCTs. Although most head and neck GCTs are benign, they  can be life-threatening and present significant challenges to surgeons, especially in newborns.[ ] Some tumors develop malignant elements, which may change the treatment strategy.[ , ] Mature teratomas in the prepubertal testis are relatively common benign lesions and may be amenable to testis-sparing surgery.[ ] Treatment options for immature teratomas include the following: Immature teratomas in children are primarily managed with surgery and observation. Evidence (surgery and observation for stage I disease): The use of chemotherapy is controversial in the treatment of immature teratomas. There are no clinical trials supporting the use of chemotherapy in children. In adult women with ovarian tumors, surgery followed by chemotherapy has been the standard treatment approach since 1976.[ ] As in children, there are no clinical trials supporting the use of chemotherapy in adults. Evidence (role of chemotherapy for immature teratomas): Additional studies on the treatment of ovarian immature teratomas with chemotherapy are needed. For more information about the treatment of ovarian immature teratomas in postpubertal females, see . Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)–supported clinical trials can be found on the . For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the . The following is an example of a national and/or institutional clinical trial that is currently being conducted: After successful resection, neonates diagnosed with benign mature and immature teratomas are closely observed with follow-up exams and serial serum AFP determinations. These tests are done for several years to ensure that AFP measurements normalize to expected physiological levels and to facilitate early detection of tumor relapse.[ , ]  Several oncology groups have reported significant rates of recurrence among these benign tumors, ranging from 10% to 21%. Most relapses occur within 3 years of resection.[ , , , ] While there is no standard follow-up schedule, tumor markers are measured frequently for 3 years in all children. With early detection, recurrent malignant GCTs can be treated successfully with surgery and chemotherapy (OS rate, 92%).[ ]  Long-term survivors are monitored for complications of extensive surgery, which include constipation, fecal and urinary incontinence, and psychologically unacceptable cosmetic scars.[ ] Use our to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. about clinical trials is also available. The role of surgery at diagnosis for germ cell tumors (GCTs) depends on patient age and tumor site, and treatment must be individualized. All malignant testicular GCTs should be resected. Resection may be followed by subsequent excision of residual masses after chemotherapy. Testicular GCTs in children occur almost exclusively in boys
younger than 5 years.[ , ] The initial surgical approach to evaluate a testicular mass in a young boy is important  because a trans-scrotal biopsy can risk inguinal node metastasis.[ , ] Radical inguinal orchiectomy with initial high
ligation of the spermatic cord is the procedure of choice.[ ] Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging evaluation, with the additional information provided by elevated tumor markers, appears adequate for staging. Retroperitoneal
dissection of lymph nodes is not beneficial in the staging of testicular GCTs in young boys.[ , ] Therefore,  there may be no reason to risk the potential morbidity (e.g., impotence and retrograde ejaculation) associated with lymph node dissection.[ , ] A revised risk stratification was developed by the Malignant Germ Cell Tumor  International Consortium (see ).[ ] Standard treatment options for malignant GCTs in prepubertal males (aged <11 years)  include the following: The treatment options for malignant GCTs in prepubertal males differ by stage of disease. Surgery and close follow-up observation are indicated to document that tumor marker levels normalize after resection.[ , ] Evidence (surgery and observation for stage I disease in prepubertal males): Surgery and chemotherapy with four cycles of standard PEb is a common treatment regimen for prepubertal males with stages II through IV disease. Patients treated with this regimen have OS rates exceeding 90%, suggesting that a reduction in therapy could be considered.[ , ] Surgery and treatment with four to six cycles of carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (JEb) is an alternative treatment regimen.[ ] Evidence (surgery and chemotherapy for stages II–IV disease in prepubertal males): The
treatment options described for prepubertal males   may not be strictly applicable
to  postpubertal males.
In particular, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is a treatment option and  may play a crucial role [ ] in the initial treatment of patients or in subsequent treatment of patients with  residual disease after chemotherapy for metastatic testicular GCT.[ , ]  A meta-analysis showed that patients older than 11 years were at higher risk of recurrence.[ ] The number of males aged 11 to 15 years with GCT is small; it is possible that these patients should be treated according to adult standards.

Most ovarian neoplasms in children and adolescents are of germ cell origin.[ ]  Ovarian GCTs are very rare in young girls, but the incidence begins to increase in children aged approximately  8 or 9 years and continues to rise throughout adulthood.[ ] Childhood malignant ovarian GCTs can be divided into germinomatous (dysgerminomas) and nongerminomatous malignant GCTs (i.e., yolk sac carcinomas, mixed GCTs, choriocarcinoma, and embryonal carcinomas). For more information about childhood mature and immature teratomas arising in the ovary, see the section. For more information about the treatment of ovarian GCT in postpubertal females, see . Standard treatment options for dysgerminomas of the ovary include the following: The treatment options for dysgerminomas of the ovary differ by stage of disease. For stage I ovarian dysgerminomas, a cure can usually be achieved by unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, conserving the uterus and opposite ovary, and close follow-up observation.[ , - ] Evidence (surgery and observation for stage I dysgerminomas): While advanced-stage ovarian dysgerminomas, like testicular seminomas, are highly curable with surgery and radiation therapy, the effects on growth, fertility, and risk of treatment-induced second malignancy in these young patients [ , ] make chemotherapy a more attractive adjunct to surgery.[ , ]  Complete tumor resection is the goal for advanced dysgerminomas. Platinum-based chemotherapy can be given preoperatively to facilitate resection or postoperatively (after debulking surgery) to avoid mutilating surgical procedures.[ ] Evidence (surgery and chemotherapy for stage II–IV dysgerminomas): This approach results in a high rate of cure and the preservation of menstrual function and fertility in most patients with dysgerminomas.[ , ] A multidisciplinary approach is essential for treatment of ovarian GCTs.  Various surgical subspecialists and the pediatric oncologist must be involved in clinical decisions. The surgical approach for pediatric ovarian GCTs is often guided by the expectation that reproductive function can be preserved. The treatment of ovarian malignant GCTs that are not dysgerminomas or immature teratomas generally involves surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.[ , ] The role for surgery at diagnosis depends on patient age and tumor site, and treatment must be individualized. The use of laparoscopy in children with ovarian GCTs has not been well studied. The use of intraoperative frozen biopsy in pediatric and adolescent patients to determine the presence of malignancy to allow an ovarian-sparing procedure has been questioned. In a retrospective analysis from the COG study, 60 of 131 eligible patients with ovarian tumors had both intraoperative frozen section and final paraffin section diagnoses available.[ ] Intraoperative frozen section biopsy was incorrect 38% of the time (23 patients), and it confirmed the final diagnosis 76% of the time. In addition, central pathological review detected additional germ cell components in 23.7% of patients. Pediatric surgical guidelines to determine stage I disease have been published.[ ] Adult surgical guidelines to determine stage are more extensive. For more information about staging of ovarian GCTs in postpubertal females, see the section in Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors Treatment. Strict surgical staging guidelines need to be followed to determine true stage I disease. Historically, in both pediatric and adult studies, comprehensive staging guidelines have not been followed. If strict surgical staging guidelines are not followed, surgery followed by chemotherapy, rather than surgery followed by observation, is the standard treatment.[ , , ] A goal of surgical therapy for pediatric GCTs is to preserve reproductive function. If conservative surgery is the choice, a high rate of cure can be obtained with adjuvant chemotherapy, and adherence to strict surgical guidelines is not necessary.[ ] Standard treatment options for malignant nongerminomatous ovarian GCTs in include the following: Standard treatment options for malignant nongerminomatous ovarian GCTs in include the following: Standard treatment options for malignant nongerminomatous ovarian GCTs that cannot be resected initially include the following: When strict surgical staging guidelines are followed, surgery followed by observation may be an appropriate treatment choice for prepubertal females with stage I disease. Evidence (surgery and observation for prepubertal females with stage I disease): A revised risk stratification was developed by the Malignant Germ Cell Tumor  International Consortium (see ).[ ] Chemotherapy regimens with cisplatin (PEb) or  carboplatin (JEb) have been used successfully in children.[ , , , ] BEP is a common regimen in young women with ovarian GCTs.[ , ] BEP differs from PEb with the addition of weekly bleomycin.  This approach results in a high rate of cure and the preservation of menstrual function and fertility in most patients with nondysgerminomas.[ , ] For more information about the dosing schedules for BEP, PEb, and JEb, see . In with purported (when strict surgical staging guidelines are not followed) surgery followed by chemotherapy (four cycles of PEb) is an appropriate treatment choice and results in EFS and OS rates of 95%.[ , ] In with purported , chemotherapy after resection remains the standard treatment. In postpubertal females, the strategy of observation after surgery has not been established and is under investigation in the trial. In , surgery and chemotherapy are considered standard treatments. Surgery and chemotherapy with four to six cycles of standard PEb is used to treat younger (prepubertal) girls,[ , ] and BEP is used to treat postpubertal girls.[ , ] Patients with normalization of tumor markers undergo imaging after four cycles of PEb, and any residual tumor is resected. Patients with residual viable tumor after surgery are considered refractory. Alternatively, surgery and chemotherapy with four to six cycles of JEb is a treatment option (as demonstrated in one study in which all patients were younger than 15 years).[ ] Primary resection of ovarian GCT is usually attempted. However, in rare instances, primary resection of the ovary is not possible without undue risk of damage to adjacent structures. In these cases, an appropriate strategy is biopsy for diagnosis, followed by chemotherapy and then subsequent surgery for patients who have residual masses after undergoing chemotherapy. Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)–supported clinical trials can be found on the . For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the . The following are examples of national and/or institutional clinical trials that are currently being conducted: Use our to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. about clinical trials is also available. In initial reports, children with extragonadal 
malignant germ cell tumors (GCTs), particularly those with advanced-stage (stage III or stage IV) disease, had the
highest risk of treatment failure for any GCT presentation.[ , ] Subsequently, an analysis of data from 25 years of pediatric GCT studies in the United States and United Kingdom reported that children younger than 11 years with extragonadal stage III and stage IV GCTs had an event-free survival (EFS) rate of 85%, and adolescents with stage III and stage IV extragonadal disease had poorer outcomes (expected EFS rate, <70%).[ ] The role of surgery at diagnosis for extragonadal tumors depends on patient age and tumor site, and treatment must be individualized. Depending on the clinical setting, the appropriate surgical approach may be primary resection,  biopsy before chemotherapy, or no surgery (e.g.,  for a mediastinal primary tumor in a patient with a compromised airway and elevated tumor markers). An appropriate strategy may be biopsy at diagnosis followed by chemotherapy and subsequent surgery in selected patients who have residual masses after chemotherapy. Standard treatment options for malignant extragonadal extracranial GCTs in prepubertal children include the following: The treatment of malignant extragonadal extracranial GCTs also depends on the site of disease. For more information, see the section. Surgery and chemotherapy with four cycles of standard cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (PEb) is one treatment option. Patients with stage I and stage II disease treated with this regimen had an overall survival (OS) rate of 90%, suggesting that a reduction in therapy may be considered.[ , ] Patients with stage III and stage IV disease had OS rates of higher than 80%.[ ] An alternative treatment option is surgery and chemotherapy with carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (JEb).[ ] Stage III and stage IV patients treated with  JEb had an OS rate similar to that with the PEb regimen.[ ] Two pediatric intergroup trials for patients with high-risk disease investigated the use of high-dose cisplatin (200 mg/m ) in a randomized study and a subsequent study that added amifostine to high-dose cisplatin.[ ] No benefit in OS was observed, and 75% of patients required hearing aids. A Children's Oncology Group (COG) trial of patients with high-risk disease investigated the addition of cyclophosphamide to standard-dose PEb. The addition of cyclophosphamide was feasible and well tolerated at all dose levels, but there was no evidence that adding cyclophosphamide improved efficacy.[ ] While outcomes  have improved remarkably since the advent of platinum-based
chemotherapy and the use of a multidisciplinary treatment approach, complete resection before chemotherapy may be possible in some patients without major morbidity.[ , ] However, for  patients  with
locally advanced sacrococcygeal tumors, mediastinal tumors,  or large pelvic tumors, tumor biopsy followed by preoperative chemotherapy may facilitate subsequent complete tumor resection and improve ultimate patient outcome. No decrease in OS has been noted for patients with malignant extragonadal GCTs who have had delayed resection after receiving chemotherapy.[ , - ] The treatment of malignant extragonadal extracranial GCTs depends in part on the site of disease. Sacrococcygeal GCTs are common extragonadal tumors that occur in very young children, predominantly young females.[ ]  The tumors are usually diagnosed at birth, when large external lesions predominate (usually mature or immature teratomas), or later in the first years of life, when presacral lesions with higher malignancy rates predominate.[ ] Malignant sacrococcygeal tumors are usually very advanced at diagnosis. Two-thirds of patients have locoregional disease, and metastases are present in 50% of patients.[ , , ] Because of their advanced stage at presentation, the management of sacrococcygeal tumors requires a multimodal approach with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by delayed tumor resection. Platinum-based therapies, with either cisplatin or carboplatin, are the cornerstone of treatment. The PEb regimen or the JEb regimen produces EFS rates of 85%.[ , ]  Surgery may be facilitated by preoperative chemotherapy. In any patient with a sacrococcygeal GCT, resection of the coccyx is mandatory.[ , ] Completeness of surgical resection is an important prognostic factor, as shown in the following circumstances:[ , , ] Mediastinal GCTs account for 15% to 20% of malignant extragonadal
extracranial GCTs in children.[ ] The histology of mediastinal
GCT is dependent on age, with teratomas predominating among
infants and yolk sac tumors predominating among children aged 1
to 4 years.[ ] Prepubertal children with mediastinal malignant teratomas are treated with tumor
resection, which is curative in almost all patients.[ ] Children with
stage I to stage III nonmetastatic mediastinal GCTs who receive 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy have 5-year EFS and OS rates of 90%. However, patients with stage IV mediastinal tumors have EFS rates closer to 80%.[ , , ]; [ ][ ] Malignant GCTs located in the retroperitoneum or abdomen usually present in children younger than 5 years. Most of these tumors are advanced stage and locally unresectable at diagnosis.[ ] A limited biopsy followed by platinum-based chemotherapy to shrink tumor bulk can lead to complete tumor resection in most patients.  Despite the advanced-stage disease in most patients, the 6-year  EFS rate using PEb was 83% in the Pediatric Oncology Group/Children's Cancer Group intergroup study.[ ] Although rare, benign and malignant GCTs can occur in the head and neck region, especially in infants. The airway is often threatened. Surgery for nonmalignant tumors and surgery plus chemotherapy for malignant tumors can be curative.[ ][ ] In a study of prognostic factors in pediatric extragonadal malignant GCTs, age older than 12 years was the most important prognostic factor. In a multivariate analysis, children aged 12 years and older with thoracic tumors had six times the risk of death compared with children younger than 12 years with primary nonthoracic tumors.[ ] In a subsequent meta-analysis, adolescents with stage III and stage IV extragonadal disease had poor outcomes (expected EFS rate, <70%).[ ] Extragonadal disease of any stage is considered a poor risk factor in adolescents and young adults.[ ] Standard treatment options for malignant extragonadal extracranial GCTs in postpubertal children include the following: As with sacrococcygeal tumors, primary chemotherapy is usually necessary to facilitate surgical resection of mediastinal GCTs, and the completeness of resection is a very important prognostic indicator.[ , ]  Survival rates for the older adolescent and young adult
population with mediastinal tumors are  generally  lower than 60%.[ , , - ]; [ ][ ] Patients with a malignant mediastinal primary tumor and extracranial metastases are at the highest risk of developing brain metastases and are monitored closely for signs and symptoms of central nervous system involvement.[ ][ ] For more information about the treatment of adult patients, see .

Only a small number of children and adolescents with extracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) have a recurrence.[ , ] Reports regarding the treatment and outcome of these children are based on small studies.[ ] Treatment options for recurrent pediatric GCTs are modeled after treatment options in adult clinical trials.

Standard treatment options for recurrent childhood malignant GCTs include the following: For information about salvage therapy after observation for patients with stage I disease, see the following sections: Reports of salvage treatment strategies used in adult recurrent GCTs  include larger numbers of patients, but the differences between children and adults regarding the location of the primary  GCT site, pattern of relapse, and the biology of childhood  GCTs may limit the applicability of adult salvage approaches to children. In adults with recurrent GCTs, several chemotherapy combinations (most include the addition of paclitaxel and ifosfamide to a platinum compound) have achieved relatively good disease-free status.[ - ]  A combination of paclitaxel and gemcitabine has demonstrated activity in adults with testicular GCTs who relapsed after high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).[ ] Among children with benign sacrococcygeal tumors who recur, a malignant component may be present at the primary tumor site. For these children, complete surgical resection of the recurrent tumor and  coccyx (if not done originally) is the basis of salvage treatment. Preoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (PEb)  may assist the surgical resection. In patients who had a malignant sacrococcygeal tumor that recurred after PEb treatment, surgery and additional chemotherapy may be warranted.[ ] In a phase II Children’s Oncology Group (COG) trial ( ), 20 patients younger than 21 years who relapsed after PEb therapy received two cycles of paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and carboplatin (TIC). Responses were then assessed by a combination of Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria and marker decline. Eight patients had partial responses, ten patients had stable disease, and two patients had progressive disease. This chemotherapy regimen produced a combined response rate of 44%.[ ] The role of HD chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell rescue for recurrent pediatric GCTs is not established, despite anecdotal reports. In one European series, 10 of 23 children with relapsed extragonadal GCTs achieved long-term disease-free survival (median follow-up, 66 months) after receiving HD chemotherapy with stem cell support.[ ]  Additional study in children and adolescents is needed. For more information about transplant, see and . HD chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue has been explored as a treatment for adults with recurrent testicular GCTs. HD chemotherapy plus hematopoietic stem cell rescue has been reported to cure adult patients with relapsed testicular GCTs, even as third-line therapy and in cisplatin-refractory patients.[ , - ] A small study also demonstrated efficacy in adolescents and women with ovarian GCTs.[ ][ ]   While some studies support this approach,[ , , , , ] others do not.[ , ] Salvage attempts using HD chemotherapy regimens may be of little benefit if the patient is not clinically disease free at the time of HSCT.[ , ] In a very small pediatric study, patients with nongerminomatous brain metastases responded to radiation therapy. In the German Maligne Keimzelltümoren (MAKEI) studies, radiation therapy and surgery for patients with brain metastases provided palliation and occasional long-term survival.[ , ][ ] A meta-analysis showed that radiation therapy did not improve outcome compared with surgery and radiation. However, the number of patients treated with radiation therapy was too small to accurately assess outcome.[ ] Information about NCI-supported clinical trials can be found on the .

ttle: Hair Products and Cancer Risk - NCI
@: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/hair-dyes-fact-sheet
txt: Why is there concern that hair dyes may cause cancer? Do hairdressers and barbers have an increased risk of cancer? Do people who have their hair dyed have increased risks of cancer? Do people who use hair straighteners or relaxers have increased risks of cancer? Why is there concern that hair dyes may cause cancer? Hair dyes use chemicals to change the color of the hair. There are three main types of hair dye: permanent, semi-permanent, and temporary. Permanent hair dyes, which make up about 80% of currently marketed hair dye products, use colorless dye intermediates and dye couplers. In the presence of , the intermediates and couplers react with one another to form pigment molecules. Darker colors are formed by using higher concentrations of intermediates. The other types of hair dyes, known as semi-permanent and temporary hair dyes, do not involve such chemical reactions. Instead, they include colored compounds that stain hair directly. Some of the chemicals in hair dye products have been reported to be carcinogenic (cancer-causing) ( , ). These include aromatic amines, which were used as dye intermediates in early permanent hair dye formulations. In the mid- to late 1970s, manufacturers changed the components in permanent hair dye products to eliminate some of the carcinogenic chemicals used as dye intermediates ( , , ). It is not known whether any of the chemicals still used in hair dyes are carcinogenic ( ). People who use hair dyes frequently as part of their job, such as professional hairdressers, likely have higher exposures to potentially harmful chemicals in these products than people who have their hair dyed in a salon or who dye it at home (that is, “personal users” of hair dye). Thus, studies have been conducted to understand both exposure to hair dyes in the occupational setting and exposure from personal use. It has been estimated that between 50% and 80% of women in the United States, Japan, and the European Union have used hair dyes ( ). Given the widespread use of hair dye products, if these products had even a small effect on cancer risk that could translate into a considerable public health impact. Do hairdressers and barbers have an increased risk of cancer? In 2010, a report from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that some of the chemicals professional hairdressers are exposed to are “probably carcinogenic to humans” ( ). This conclusion is based on many studies that have found an increased risk of in hairdressers and barbers who were occupationally exposed to hair dye ( , ). A 2010 of 42 studies found that the longer someone had worked as a hairdresser, the more likely they were to have developed bladder cancer. Those who had been hairdressers for at least 10 years were nearly twice as likely to develop bladder cancer as those who had never worked as a hairdresser ( ). One study looked at risks among Swedish hairdressers over different time periods. That study found no increased risk in recent decades, suggesting that professional use of modern hair dyes, which no longer contain aromatic amines, may not be associated with bladder cancer risk ( ). Do people who have their hair dyed have increased risks of cancer? that follow groups of people over time ( ) or that study people with and without specific cancers ( ) have examined possible associations between personal use of hair dyes and risks of several cancers. Based on a review of existing evidence, the IARC Working Group considers personal use of hair dyes overall as “not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans” ( ). A 2014 analysis of data pooled from 17 studies found no evidence of an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with personal hair dye use ( ). However, for personal use of permanent hair dyes specifically, the evidence of an association with bladder cancer is mixed. Some studies ( – ) found no association, whereas others found an association in specific subgroups of users ( – ). A number of studies have investigated the relationship between personal use of hair dyes and the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with conflicting results. A pooled (combined) analysis of four case–control studies found that women who began using hair dye before 1980 (before formulations were changed to remove compounds) were 1.3 times as likely to develop NHL as women who had never used hair dye, whereas no increase in risk was seen for women who began using hair dye after 1980 ( ). A large 2020 reported no association between personal use of hair dye and the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( ). Many studies have examined possible associations between hair dye use and breast cancer, with mixed and inconsistent results. However, more recent studies that have looked at larger populations of women with longer follow-up periods and more detailed characterization of hair dyes and other breast cancer have found that certain kinds of exposures may be associated with risk. For example, a large US cohort study that included mostly White women reported an increased risk of breast cancer overall, and of breast cancers, with increasing exposure to hair dye ( ). Another study of US women who used dark or permanent hair dyes found that risks of breast cancer were higher in those who reported any use of hair dye than in those who reported no use ( ). When the authors analyzed the data by racial group, they found that among non-Hispanic White women, hair dye users were 1.07 times as likely to develop breast cancer as non users, and among Black women users were 1.45 times as likely to develop breast cancer as nonusers ( ). Some studies have found that individuals who apply permanent hair dye themselves at home have a higher breast cancer risk than those who have it applied by a professional ( , ). Although some individual studies have shown associations between hair dye use and the risk of leukemia, a of 20 studies showed a small association that was not ( ). In addition, a large cohort study found no association between ever use of hair dye and the risk of leukemia but very slightly increased risks of (particularly in women with naturally light hair) and ( ). Do people who use hair straighteners or relaxers have increased risks of cancer? Treatments used to straighten or relax hair contain a mixture of chemicals. Some formulations contain the  as an active ingredient. Several studies have found associations between the use of hair straighteners or relaxers and the subsequent development of breast cancer. Recently, a large found that women who had used any straightening products in the previous 12 months had 1.8 times the risk of developing as those who had never used such a product ( ). Because hair straighteners and relaxers contain varying compositions of chemicals, future studies will try to narrow down which chemicals have specific health impacts. Bolt HM, Golka K.

The Center for Cancer Genomics at NCI initiated BLGSP in collaboration with the . The molecular characterization data from Burkitt lymphoma patients identified through BLGSP will be available to the research community worldwide in a publicly available, yet patient privacy-protected database. Burkitt lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs most often in children and young adults. It is associated with a chromosomal translocation of the MYC gene to one of the three immunoglobulin loci. Burkitt lymphoma is divided into three main clinical variants: endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-associated. These variants are generally distinguishable by previous exposure to viral infection, tumor location, and geographic location of the patients, although there are exceptions. Current chemotherapy regimens are effective in approximately 40%–90% of patients. Treatment success depends on age, stage of the disease, treatment regimen, and site of the treatment facility. The variability of tumor response demonstrates the need for new treatments to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. BLGSP for pediatric cases has been completed. . BLGSP for adult cases is an ongoing project currently in phase 4 (publication). More information about BLGSP can be found on the . HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project (HTMCP) The Center for Cancer Genomics, along with the , initiated the HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project (HTMCP) to gain insight into the genetic events driving HIV-associated cancers and to determine why certain cancers, but not others, have higher incidences in HIV-positive patients. The molecular characterization data from patients identified through HTMCP will be available to the research community worldwide in a publicly available, yet patient privacy-protected database. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a complex and devastating disease caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy has considerably slowed disease progression from HIV to full-blown AIDS, thereby increasing the number of people living with HIV. Despite this success in survivorship, certain types of cancers are becoming more prevalent in the expanding pool of HIV-infected individuals. While coinfecting viruses and, possibly, immunodeficiency may play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated cancers, our understanding of its etiology is inadequate. Understanding the molecular causes of these tumors may translate into improved therapies for a growing population of patients doubly afflicted with HIV and cancer.

txt: Transition from the mentored phase (K99) to the independent phase (R00) is not automatic. To activate the R00 phase, K99 PD(s)/PI(s) must have been offered and accepted a tenure-track, full-time assistant professor position (or equivalent) at an eligible domestic institution with the appropriate infrastructure to support the proposed research program and a history of external research funding. Further details on R00 activation for those who have active NCI K99 awards can be found in the . Postdoctoral candidates who have terminal clinical or research doctorates (or equivalent doctoral degrees) and who have no more than 4 years of postdoctoral research training at the time of initial application receipt date, or subsequent resubmission(A1) are eligible to apply. This means that, regardless of whether the application is New or a Resubmission (A1) application, the applicant must have fewer than 4 years of postgraduate research experience at the application due date. For example, if an applicant is within the 4 years of eligibility at the time of the initial application due date but surpassed the 4 years of eligibility at the time of resubmission, they are no longer eligible to apply for the award, and may not resubmit the application.  Exceptions to the 4-year limit may be approved, e.g., where significant changes in fields of study have occurred, such as moving from physical science to life science research, or from engineering to behavioral research. Such exceptions will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will require concurrence of NCI program staff.  NCI program concurrence must be obtained prior to submission, and a statement describing the circumstances must be included in the application. The answer to this question is complicated, and applicants are encouraged to contact an NCI Program Officer for additional guidance. In general, the clock starts with the first relevant Ph.D. degree. Depending on the research training experience, some Ph.D.’s may count as biomedically relevant (e.g., Biochemistry, Biophysics). However, if the first Ph.D. is in a completely unrelated field (e.g., English), the clock starts with the second, relevant Ph.D. Yes, it does. All Postdoctoral research experience counts, including time spent conducting research (or publishing research results) where you obtained your doctoral degree prior to starting an official postdoctoral position. The applicant institution is responsible for determining and documenting the candidate’s visa status for the duration of the award. For awards with more than one phase or a change in institution, it is the responsibility of the institution where the research will be performed (i.e., R00 phase, new institution) to document visa status. A change of sponsoring institution is permitted only when all the terms and benefits attributable to the original award can be assured. Consultation with the applicable NIH program and grants management staff is strongly encouraged when a change of institution is being considered. Yes, K99/R00 award recipients can check “Yes” in the “ ” box when applying for their first NIH R01 support. This is consistent with existing policy of considering recipients of all mentored career development awards (e.g., K01, K08, K22, K23, K25, K99) as “New Investigators” when applying for their first NIH R01 support. Eligible K99/R00 applicants should submit a request for a 1-year extension of the K99/R00 eligibility window for childbirth to the relevant . The request must include the child’s date of birth. Please do not send personal documents such as birth certificates. Are men, those who have adopted children, and same-sex partners of individuals giving birth eligible for the automatic one-year extension of the K99/R00 application eligibility due to childbirth? The one-year extension will automatically apply to women giving birth. Men, those adopting children, as well as same-sex partners of individuals giving birth can send a request for an extension to the relevant . For the K99 extension process, the automatic 12-month extension for childbirth is in total. However, if there are other extenuating circumstances (i.e., illness, military service, natural disaster) that necessitate a longer extension, those should be submitted to the relevant .

ttle: Genes Co-mutated with KRAS - NCI

txt:  ,
    by    Bob Stephens and Jim Hartley Figure 1. Common mutations in pancreatic adenocarcinomas. The NIH Center for Cancer Genomics hosts a to seven large data sets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, and the Exceptional Responders Initiative. Since RAS genes are frequent drivers of human cancers, there are significant subsets of these "Big Data" that are related to the status of RAS genes and pathways in tumors from cancer patients. We in the NCI RAS Initiative have begun to delve into these relationships to derive new clues about the biology of cancers containing mutant RAS genes. It is known that some KRAS mutations are more common particular cancer types.  For example, G12D mutations are common in pancreatic cancers, whereas G12C mutations are the most common in lung cancers (Stephen, et al., Cancer Cell 25, 272, 2014).  Since mutations in the KRAS gene are thought to be early or initiating events in human cancers, we asked if different KRAS mutants might select for particular amino acid changes in other mutated genes ("co-mutated").  In the same samples we also screened for frequent specific amino acid changes in genes in the same samples when KRAS was not mutated ("contra-mutated"). Here we present the results of analyses of exome sequences of human lung, pancreas, colon, and rectal adenocarcinoma samples deposited in the TCGA. (Note that TCGA data treat colon and rectal cancers as separate diseases.) We found that common missense mutations in KRAS do not select for specific co-mutations in other genes. 1. Each column represents a single patient sample. 2. Each row represents a single gene that passes the significance filters described in Methods. 3. Colored rectangles represent genes that contained missense mutations in that patient sample. 4. White rectangles represent genes that were wild-type in that patient sample. 5. The color of each rectangle denotes the particular amino acid change in that gene. The colors are arbitrary, thus similar colors do not have any meaning. For example, in rectal adenocarcinomas the green rectangles in the BRAF row represent mutations of valine to glutamic acid (at position 600), while the green rectangles in the TP53 row represent a different starting and mutated amino acid. 6. When a particular amino acid change in a gene was present often enough to pass a significance filter (for example BRAF V600E), it was given its own row.   Black rectangles in such rows represent the other mutations of that gene. 7. Gene names are alphabetical within each of three groups. a. Blue gene names represent genes that were at least four times more likely to be mutated when KRAS is mutated. b. Red gene names represent genes that were at least four times more likely to be mutated when KRAS is wild-type. c. Black gene names represent genes that were mutated in at least 20% of the patient samples but whose status does not correlate with KRAS mutation status. 8. The "Counts" for each gene represent a) the number of times that gene was mutated in samples that contained mutant KRAS; and b) the number of times that gene was mutated in samples that contained wild-type KRAS. 9. See Methods for more precise definitions. TCGA data were analyzed for genes that were co-mutated when KRAS genes were mutated or wild-type, and for genes that were highly mutated regardless of KRAS mutation status. Results for pancreatic, lung, colon, and rectal cancer are displayed as a grid of rectangles colored to represent specific amino acid changes in each tumor sample.  Figure 2. Common mutations in lung adenocarcinomas. Figure 3. Common mutations in colon adenocarcinomas. Figure 4. Common mutations in rectal adenocarcinomas. For the four KRAS mutants, G12D, V, C, and R, that predominated in these human tumor samples, the algorithm described here detected no specific co-mutated amino acids in any other gene.  We conclude that for this level of analysis on this data set it appears that there are many paths to cancer phenotypes after KRAS becomes mutated. It also seems likely that individual sample diversity is high enough to preclude deriving subtle differences given the numbers of samples harboring each mutant KRAS allele. Evidence is accumulating that different oncogenic mutants of KRAS have different biologies.  These variations have been described in vitro (Hunter, et al., Mol Cancer Res. 2015 Jun 2. pii: molcanres.0203.2015), in vivo (Westcott, et al., Nature 517, 489, 2015), and in human patients (Ihle, et al., J Natl Cancer Inst 104, 228, 2012). With the availability of abundant sequence data from hundreds of human cancers, we hypothesized that the different bahaviors of mutant KRAS proteins might select for specific co-mutations in other genes during progression from early KRAS mutations to full-blown cancer. While we found interesting patterns of co- and contra-mutation, we did not find evidence supporting our main hypothesis in colon, rectal, pancreatic, and lung cancer sequences collected by The Cancer Genome Atlas. However, it is still possible that these allele-specific differences could be manifested in other data platforms captured within TCGA such as methylation, expression, copy number variations and miRNA expression alterations. We hope that you can suggest other interpretations of our data, or other RAS-centric ways of interrogating the big data sources as they become accessible. Data were downloaded from the site and formatted so they could be analyzed using Sequence Query Language (SQL). Note that all TCGA samples for each tumor type were included in our analyses. We wrote an R script that does the following: Test 1: Some of the TCGA samples contain surprisingly high numbers (thousands) of mutated genes. We reasoned that most of the mutations in such samples were likely to be passengers, rather than drivers of cancer phenotypes. Therefore the mean number of mutant genes in samples from each tumor type was determined, and samples with numbers of mutant genes greater than two standard deviations above the mean were excluded from further tests. Test 2: Highly mutated genes (in >15% of the samples but <85% of the samples) from the input gene list in tumor samples were candidates for use as index genes.  Here we chose KRAS as the index gene for co-mutation analysis.  In this iteration, the script selected only missense mutations in exons. Test 3: The entire TCGA gene list was queried and co-mutated or contra-mutated genes were found by requiring candidate genes to pass two tests.  Test 3a: Genes must be mutated in at least 10% of the samples where either KRAS is mutant (such as ATM and TP53 in lung adenocarcinoma), or where KRAS is wild-type (such as EGFR and TP53 in lung adenocarcinoma).  Test 3b: Call genes  co-mutated with KRAS when they are mutant more than 4 times as often (by frequency) when KRAS is mutant [(fGENEmut:KRASmut) / (fGENEmut:KRASwt) >4]. Call genes contra-mutated with KRAS when they are mutant 4 times as often when KRAS is wild-type [(fGENEmut:KRASmut) / (fGENEmut:KRASwt) <0.25].  Using these criteria, ATM is co-mutated with KRAS in the TCGA lung adenocarcinomas, and EGFR mutations are contra-mutated with KRAS in lung adenocarcinomas. Test 4: Genes that were highly mutated (>20%) regardless of index gene (here, KRAS) status were also found.  For example, TP53 is mutated in 74 of 154 (48%) colon cancers, but not biased toward either co-mutation with KRAS (42%) or contra-mutation with mutant KRAS genes (52%). Test 5: Single missense mutations that satisfy either Test 3 or Test 4 are displayed in separate rows. The G12V mutation of KRAS in lung adenocarcinoma is shown as a separate line because that particular amino acid change satisfies Test 3 (>10% of the samples with mutant KRAS contain the KRAS G12V mutation and this is >4x the number when KRAS is wild-type (0)). In colon adenocarcinoma samples not only is BRAF contra-mutated with mutant KRAS, so is the particular V600E mutation of BRAF.  Interestingly, while the PIK3CA genes as a group in colon samples do not pass Test 3 or Test 4 (26/154 are mutant, thus not highly mutated (Test 4), and not > 4-fold enriched in samples that are mutant for KRAS (15/54 vs 7/95 = 3.78 fold), the specific E545K mutation passes Test 3 as co-mutated with KRAS (mutant 7/57 when KRAS is mutant, mutant 0/97 when KRAS is wild-type).  We do not know if there is a biological basis for this observation. Results from the above tests are plotted as a grid of rectangles, in which each rectangle represents one gene in one patient tumor sample.  For example the TCGA lung adenocarcinomas comprise 228 samples, which are displayed as vertical columns, and the R script described above generated 34 mutated genes for these samples (co-mutated, contra-mutated, or highly mutated), which are shown as rows across the samples. When a gene is mutated in a particular sample, that rectangle is colored for that particular missense mutation.  For example, ten different missense mutants of KRAS were found in the TCGA colon cancer samples (N = 129).  Of these, 21 times the 12th amino acid of KRAS, glycine, was changed to aspartic acid (G12D), 14 times the same glycine was changed to valine (G12V), and in 17 other samples KRAS was mutated at other positions or to different amino acids. White rectangles in the diagrams show that gene in that tumor sample was wild-type. Black rectangles appear only in rows in which a specific amino acid change passed the above tests, and represent mutations in that gene other than the specified mutation.  For example, in lung adenocarcinomas the G12C mutation of KRAS passed the above tests, and such samples appear as green rectangles in the KRASG12C row.  Patient samples with other KRAS mutations, such as G12V, G13D, etc. are represented as black rectangles in that row.

ttle: The Mutational Spectra of Cancer Genes in TCGA Data - NCI

    by    Bob Stephens KRAS Q61 mutations found in different cancer types. Cancer is at root a genetic disease, driven in almost all cases by mutations or rearrangements of otherwise normal genes. (The exceptions, such as cervical cancer, are caused by viruses.) is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to characterize the genetic changes that drive or cooperate in human cancers.  We in the NCI RAS Initiative use TCGA data to guide research priorities and understand how we might attack mutated RAS genes, which are major causes of human cancers. Here we present graphical representations of TCGA data on eight major cancer genes: , , , , , and the three genes themselves, , , and . The TCGA has characterized over 10,000 samples of human tumors from over 30 tumor types, using technologies that have evolved rapidly since the program's start. The data we present here are derived from exome or whole genome sequencing, but extensive data have also been derived from RNAseq (for transcription and miRNAs) and methylation profiling (for epigenitic correlations). TCGA data have been foundational for hundreds of publications, and are likely to be valuable for many discoveries still to come. For example, the data reveal that the proportions of different mutant RAS alleles vary among different tumor types. Thus G12C mutations are enriched in lung adenocarcinoma samples relative to pancreatic or colorectal tumor samples also mutated in . Similarly, the colorectal samples show an enrichment in G13 mutations and also A146 mutations. We now know these differences are at least partially the result of the different mutational environments represented in these different tissues. For example, cigarette smoking largely contributes to the G12C mutations in the lung, along with a specific mutation in that same tissue . Many of these tumor type specificities have been described by Alexandrov, et al. On a more global scale, involvement of different RAS gene family members is observed in different cancers. For example, appears to be the dominant mutated RAS gene in both thyroid cancer and melanoma, while mutations are dominant in colorectal, lung, pancreas and uterine tumors. The mutant alleles are predominantly at the Q61 position while those in are predominantly at the G12 position. Our goal here is to provide researchers with representations of the mutations found in RAS and other important cancer genes, and connect those data with the types of cancers in which they are found. "Is there a cancer in which the G13 position of is mutated more often than G12?" "In what cancers are Q61 mutations prevalent?" "What mutations are commonly found in glioblastoma?" The graphs we present here are sources of information about such questions. We tried to make the bar graphs for the mutations in the eight genes self-explanatory. Our analysis takes an input gene and retrieves all of the mutations recorded for that gene per sample for each tumor type within TCGA. For the purposes of this analysis, we included protein-changing mutations such as frame-shifts and non-synonymous substitutions. However, we excluded recorded mutations within introns and UTRs including those that impacted known splice sites within the gene. This was done for the purposes of simplifying the visualization and in no way diminishes the potential importance of these mutation classes. We included each tumor type if the gene of interest was mutated in 5 or more samples. Of the mutations retained after this filter step, mutations were counted both at the level of the specific allele, (e.g. G12V) and also at a position level (e.g. G12), permitting both allele-specific and position-specific enrichment to be assessed. Importantly, our counts reflect the aggregate of recorded mutations within a tumor type, and because some samples have more than one mutation the count reflects the number of patients with that mutation, but the sum across all counts does not reflect the number of patients affected overall. The plots are annotated with the total number of samples and the total number of mutations in an attempt to clarify this possible discrepancy. We illustrate our analyses by reference to the TCGA data for . The first pages of the analysis show plots of the specific for each tumor type where more than 5 samples showed mutations. All the mutations in the TCGA database for that gene in that tumor are initially graphed, and if the number of mutations is >25, we remove the excess and plot the remainder ("Top 25"). An example of this can be seen on page 9 of the KRAS pdf. The and mutations are the most common in colon adenocarcinoma. Next, we move out a level and repeat the analysis but disregard the specific amino acid changes and graph only the of the mutations.  In this way hot spots that correlate with biology are more obvious. On page 23 of KRAS, the position is almost the only mutation site found in pancreatic cancer. After finishing with each tumor type, we analyze the mutations across all the cancer types.

Organoids and other next-generation cancer models are a key technology in precision oncology research. CCG staff will be presenting at AACR 2023 on HCMI, NCI’s program generating hundreds of advanced cancer models for researchers. By uncovering new cell states and how cell states may change, researchers are gaining much needed insights into how small cell lung cancer develops and progresses. Dr. Charles Rudin and Dr. Dana Pe’er from NCI’s Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) discuss how they are using single-cell technologies to learn more about this deadly form of lung cancer. Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) are emerging as oncogenic elements in cancer genomes. Dr. Chia-Lin Wei, Dr. Roel Verhaak, and Dr. Howard Chang are studying the interactions ecDNAs have with chromatin and amongst each other, revealing novel mechanisms of activating oncogenes and suggesting a bigger role for ecDNAs in cancer than previously appreciated. Identifying new targets and therapies for cancers will require thinking beyond the proverbial oncogene. Researchers from NCI’s Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTD2) Network discuss new ways to model cancer and its potential vulnerabilities. Identifying the “targets” for targeted therapy is a major challenge in precision medicine research. Dr. Jason Sheltzer discusses how he inadvertently uncovered mischaracterized cancer targets and what his findings may mean for cancer drug development. The molecular mechanisms by which HPV infection leads to cancer, especially in low- and middle-income countries experiencing high incidence and mortality rates, have yet to be clearly delineated. A recent genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic study of cervical tumors from Ugandan patients looks at specific types of HPV and the genomic alterations they cause. A short time ago the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) was just a dream. CCG Director Lou Staudt describes what the GDC team has built so far: an interactive data system with genomic data processing pipelines for all types of researchers to use. To better understand the off-target programs of cancer therapies, CTD² researchers created PANACEA, a gene expression database in response to 400 FDA-approved or late stage clinical cancer drugs, and hosted a community challenge to identify drug off-targets. New features of HCMI's Searchable Catalog allows users to easily locate models of interest and their associated data at the Genomic Data Commons. HCMI is generating next-generation cancer models with quality-controlled clinical, biospecimen and molecular characterization data for the research community. Recent updates to the CTD² Dashboard include changes to the presentation, annotation of experimental methods, search function, and addition of new links to external data resources and web applications. The CTD² Dashboard aims to make functional data and results from the CTD² Network easily accessible.      Archive

ttle: Cancer Genetics Overview (PDQ®) - NCI
@: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/overview-pdq?cid=eb_govdel
txt: [ ] [ ] The etiology of cancer is multifactorial, with genetic, environmental, medical, and lifestyle factors interacting to produce a given malignancy.  Knowledge of cancer genetics is rapidly improving our understanding of cancer biology, helping to identify at-risk individuals, furthering the ability to characterize malignancies, establishing treatment tailored to the molecular fingerprint of the disease, and leading to the development of new therapeutic modalities.  As a consequence, this expanding knowledge base has implications for all aspects of cancer management, including prevention, screening, and treatment. Genetic information provides a means of identifying people who have an increased risk of cancer.  Sources of genetic information include biologic samples of , information derived from a person’s family history of disease, findings from physical examinations, and medical records. DNA-based information can be gathered, stored, and analyzed at any time during an individual’s life span, from before conception to after death.  Family history may identify people with a modest to moderately increased risk of cancer or may serve as the first step in the identification of an inherited cancer predisposition that confers a very high lifetime risk of cancer.  For an increasing number of diseases, DNA-based testing can be used to identify a specific as the cause of inherited risk and to determine whether family members have inherited the disease-related variant. The proportion of individuals carrying a pathogenic variant who will manifest the
disease is referred to as .  In general, common that are associated with cancer susceptibility have a lower penetrance than rare genetic variants. This is depicted in . For adult-onset diseases, penetrance is
usually described by the individual age and sex.  For example, the
penetrance for breast cancer in female carriers of pathogenic variants is often quoted by age 50 years and by age 70 years. Of the numerous methods for estimating penetrance, none are without potential biases, and determining an individual carrier's risk of cancer involves some level of imprecision. Genetic variants, or changes in the usual DNA sequence of a particular gene,  can have harmful, beneficial, neutral, or uncertain effects on health and may be inherited as , , or X-linked traits.  Pathogenic variants that cause serious disability early in life are usually rare because of their adverse effect on life expectancy and reproduction.  However, if the pathogenic variant is autosomal recessive—that is, if the health effect of the variant is caused only when two copies (one from each parent) of the altered gene are inherited— carriers of the pathogenic variant (healthy people carrying one copy of the altered gene) may be relatively common in the general population. in this context refers, by convention, to a prevalence of 1% or more.  Pathogenic variants that cause health effects in middle and older age, including several pathogenic variants known to cause a predisposition to cancer, may also be relatively common.  Many cancer-predisposing traits are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, that is, the cancer susceptibility occurs when only one copy of the altered gene is inherited. For autosomal dominant conditions, the term is often used in a less formal manner to denote people who have inherited the conferred by the pathogenic variant.  (Refer to individual focused on the genetics of specific cancers for detailed information on known cancer-susceptibility syndromes.) Increasingly, the public is turning to the Internet for information related both to and to cancer and to genetic and testing.  Direct-to-consumer marketing of genetic testing for hereditary breast and colon cancer is also taking place in some communities.  This wider availability of information related to inherited cancer risk may raise concerns among persons previously unaware of the implications inherent in their family histories and may lead some of these individuals to consult their primary care physicians for management advice and recommendations.  In many instances, the evaluation and advice will be relatively straightforward for physicians with a basic knowledge of familial cancer. In a subset of patients, the evaluation may be more complex, calling for referral to genetics professionals for further evaluation and counseling. Correctly recognizing and identifying individuals and families at increased risk of developing cancer is one of countless important roles for primary care and other health care providers.  Once identified, these individuals can then be appropriately referred for , risk assessment, consideration of genetic testing, and development of a management plan.  When medical and family histories reveal cardinal clues to the presence of an underlying familial or genetic cancer susceptibility disorder (see list below),[ ] further evaluation may be warranted. (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information about the components of a genetics cancer risk assessment.) Features of hereditary cancer include the following: Concluding that an individual is at increased risk of developing cancer may have important, potentially life-saving management implications and may lead to specific interventions aimed at reducing risk (e.g., tamoxifen for breast cancer, colonoscopy for colon cancer, or risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy for ovarian cancer).  Information about familial cancer risk may also inform a person’s ability to plan for the future (lifestyle and health care decisions, family planning, or other decisions). Genetic information may also provide a direct health benefit by demonstrating the lack of an inherited cancer susceptibility.  For example, if a family is known to carry a cancer- in a particular gene, a family member may experience reduced worry and lower health care costs if his or her genetic test indicates that he or she does not carry the family’s disease-related variant. Conversely, information about familial cancer risk may have psychological effects or social costs (e.g., worry, guilt, or increased health care costs). Family dynamics also may be affected.  For instance, the involvement of one or more family members may be required for genetic testing to be , and parents may feel guilty about passing inherited risk on to their children. Knowledge about a cancer-predisposing variant can be informative not only for the individual tested but also for other family members.  Family members who previously had not considered the implications of their family history for their own health may be led to do so, and some will undergo genetic testing, resulting in more definitive information on whether they are at increased genetic risk. Some relatives may learn their carrier status without being directly tested, for example, when a biological parent of a child who is a known  carrier of a pathogenic variant is identified as an obligate carrier.  Founder effects may result in the recognition that specific ethnic groups have a higher prevalence of certain pathogenic variants, knowledge that can be either clinically useful (permitting more rational genetic testing strategies) or potentially stigmatizing. Testing may reveal the presence of nonpaternity in a family.  There is the theoretical possibility that genetic information may be misused, and concerns about the potential for insurance and/or 
employment discrimination may arise.  
Genetic information may also affect medical and lifestyle decisions. Refer to 
individual PDQ summaries for available evidence addressing all ancillary issues. is a process of communication between genetics professionals and patients with the goal of providing individuals and families with information on the relevant aspects of their genetic health, available testing and management options, and support as they move toward understanding and incorporating this information into their daily lives. Genetic counseling generally involves the following six steps: Genetic evaluation involves an interaction with a medical geneticist or other genetics professional and may include a physical examination and diagnostic testing, in addition to genetic counseling.  The principles of voluntary and informed decision making, nondirective and noncoercive counseling, and protection of client confidentiality and privacy are central to the philosophy of genetic counseling.[ - ]   (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information on the nature and history of genetic counseling.) From the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, genetic counseling expanded to include discussion of genetic testing for cancer risk, as more associated with inherited cancer risk were discovered.  Cancer genetic counseling often involves a multidisciplinary team of health professionals that may include a genetic counselor, an advanced practice genetics nurse, or a medical geneticist; a mental health professional; and various medical experts such as an oncologist, surgeon, or internist.  The process of counseling may require a number of visits to address medical, genetic testing, and psychosocial issues.  Even when cancer risk counseling is initiated by an individual, inherited cancer risk has implications for the entire family.  Because genetic risk affects an unknown number of biological relatives, contact with these relatives is often essential to collect accurate family and medical histories.  Cancer genetic counseling may involve several family members, some of whom will have had cancer and others who have not. The impact of and predisposition genetic testing is improved health outcomes.  Risk assessment and/or genetic testing identifies at-risk individuals before cancer develops. This allows health care providers to tailor an individual approach for the patient and optimizes long-term health outcomes. Thus, the health care provider can  intervene earlier  to reduce cancer risk or diagnose cancer at an earlier stage, when the chances for effective treatment are greatest.  The information may be used to modify the management approach to an initial cancer, clarify the risks of other cancers, or predict the response of an existing cancer to specific forms of treatment, all of which may alter treatment recommendations and long-term follow-up. Individual PDQ summaries focused on the genetics of specific cancers contain detailed information about many known cancer susceptibility syndromes. Although this is not a complete list, the following cancer susceptibility syndromes are discussed in the PDQ cancer genetics summaries (listed in parentheses after the syndromes): The methods in this section provide a brief background about the genetic analysis and discovery approaches that have been used during the past 10 to 15 years to identify disease . These methods led to the discovery of important cancer genes like , ,  and other breast cancer risk genes.  Since then, genetic analysis techniques have transitioned to methods, as described in the section of this summary. Since it was recognized that cancer clusters in families, investigators have collected data on families with multiple cancer cases. The investigators aimed to localize cancer susceptibility genes via linkage studies. Linkage studies are typically performed on high-risk , in whom multiple cases of a particular disease have occurred, in an effort to identify disease susceptibility genes. statistically compares the between and individuals. Linkage analysis also seeks evidence that known genetic markers are inherited along with the disease trait. If such evidence is found ( ), it provides statistical data that the chromosomal region near the known genetic marker also harbors a disease susceptibility gene. Once a genomic region of interest has been identified through linkage analysis, additional studies are required to prove that there truly is a susceptibility gene at this position. Linkage analysis is affected by the following: An additional issue in linkage studies is the background rate of in the context of family studies.  For example, because a man’s lifetime risk of prostate cancer is one in eight,[ ] it is possible that families under study have both and sporadic prostate cancer cases.  Thus, a male may still develop prostate cancer, even if he does not inherit the prostate cancer susceptibility gene that is present in his family. Hence, studies have addressed  inconsistencies between linkage data by requiring strict inclusion criteria that define clinically significant disease.[ - ] This approach attempts to define a homogeneous set of cases/families to increase the likelihood of identifying a linkage signal. are identifying common, low- susceptibility for many complex diseases,[ ] including cancer. This approach can be contrasted with linkage analysis, which searches for genetic-risk cosegregating within families that have a high prevalence of disease. While linkage analyses are designed to uncover rare, highly penetrant variants that segregate in predictable heritance patterns (e.g., , , , and mitochondrial), GWAS are best suited to identify multiple, common, low-penetrance genetic . GWAS are conducted under the assumption that the genetic underpinnings of complex phenotypes, such as prostate cancer, are governed by many alleles, each conferring modest risk. Most genetic polymorphisms in GWAS are common, with minor allele frequencies greater than 1% to 5% within a given population (e.g., men of European ancestry). GWAS capture a large portion of common variation across the genome.[ , ] The strong correlation between many alleles located close to one another on a given (called ) allows one to “scan” the genome without having to test all 10 million known . With GWAS, researchers can test approximately 1 million to 5 million SNPs per study and ascertain almost all common inherited variants in the genome. In a GWAS, allele frequency for each SNP is compared between cases and controls. Promising signals—in which allele frequencies deviate significantly in case compared to control populations—are validated in replication cohorts. To have adequate statistical power to identify variants associated with a phenotype, large numbers of cases and controls, typically thousands of each, are studied. Because up to 1 million SNPs are evaluated in a GWAS, findings are expected to occur frequently when using standard statistical thresholds. Therefore, stringent statistical rules are used to declare a positive finding, usually using a threshold of < 1 × 10 .[ - ] To date, hundreds of cancer-risk variants have been identified by well-powered GWAS and validated in independent cohorts.[ ] These studies have revealed consistent associations between specific inherited variants and cancer risk. However, the findings should be qualified with a few important considerations: The implications of these points are discussed in greater detail in the PDQ summaries on ; ; and . Additional details can be found elsewhere.[ ] Broad-scale genome sequencing approaches, including , (WES), and (WGS), are rapidly being developed and incorporated into a spectrum of clinical oncologic settings, including cancer therapeutics and  cancer risk assessment.  Several institutions and companies offer , and some are developing precision medicine programs that sequence tumor genomes to identify driver genetic alterations that are targetable for therapeutic benefit to patients.[ - ]  Many of these tumor-based approaches use sequences as a reference to discriminate between changes only within the tumor and those that are potentially inherited.  In the and cancer setting, the use of multigene testing to evaluate inherited cancer risk is becoming more common and may become routine in the near future, with institutions and companies offering multigene testing to detect alterations in a host of cancer risk–associated . These advances in gene sequencing technologies also identify in genes related to the primary indication for ordering genetic sequence testing, along with findings not related to the disorder being tested.  The latter genetic findings, termed incidental or secondary findings, are currently a source of clinical, ethical, legal, and counseling debate.  The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues have published literature that address some of these issues and provide guidance and recommendations for their use.[ - ]
 However, controversy continues about when and what results to provide to patients and their health care providers. This section was created to provide information about genomic sequencing technologies in the context of clinical sequencing and highlights additional areas of clinical uncertainty for which further research and approaches are needed. DNA sequencing technologies have undergone rapid evolution, particularly since 2005 when , or (NGS), was introduced.[ ] Automated is considered the first generation of sequencing technology.[ ]  Sanger cancer gene sequencing uses (PCR) amplification of genetic regions of interest followed by sequencing of PCR products using fluorescently labeled terminators, capillary electrophoresis separation of products, and laser signal detection of nucleotide sequence.[ , ]  While this is an accurate sequencing  technology, the main limitations of Sanger sequencing  include low , a limited ability to sequence more than a few genes at a time, and the inability to detect structural rearrangements.[ ] NGS refers to high throughput DNA sequencing technologies that are capable of processing multiple DNA sequences in parallel.[ ]  Although platforms differ in template generation and sequence interrogation, the overall approach to NGS technologies involves shearing and immobilizing DNA template molecules onto a solid surface, which allows separation of molecules for simultaneous sequencing reactions (millions to billions) to be performed in a parallel fashion.[ , ] Thus, the major advantages of NGS technologies include the ability to sequence thousands of genes at one time, a lower cost, and the ability to detect multiple types of genomic alterations, such as , , , and rearrangements.[ ]   Limitations include the possibility that specific gene regions may be missed, turnaround time can be lengthy (although it is decreasing), and informatics support to handle massive amounts of genetic data has lagged behind the sequencing capability.  A well-recognized bottleneck to utilizing NGS data is the lack of advanced computational infrastructure to preserve, process, and analyze the vast amount of genetic data.  The magnitude of the variants obtained from NGS is exponential; bioinformatics approaches need to evaluate for predicted functional consequence in disease biology.  There is also a need for user-friendly bioinformatics pipelines to analyze and integrate genetic data to influence the scientific and medical community.[ , ] The following terms are defined to better understand the clinical application of NGS testing and implications of results reported. NGS has multiple potential clinical applications. In oncology, the two dominant applications are: 1) the assessment of somatic alterations in tumors to inform prognosis and/or targeted therapeutics; and 2) the assessment of the germline to identify cancer risk . There are multiple approaches to tumor testing for somatic alterations. With targeted multigene testing, a number of different genes can be assessed simultaneously. These targeted multigene tests can differ substantially in the genes that are included, and they can be tailored to individual tumor types. Targeted multigene testing limits the data to be analyzed and includes only known genes, which makes the interpretation more straightforward than in whole exome or whole genome techniques. In addition, greater is possible with targeted multigene testing than with WES or WGS. Depth of coverage refers to the number of times a nucleotide has been sequenced; a greater depth of coverage has fewer sequencing errors.  Deep coverage also aids in differentiating sequencing errors from . WES and WGS are far more extensive techniques and aim to uncover variants in known genes and in genes not suspected a priori.   The discovery of a variant that is unexpected for a particular  tumor type can lead to the use of a directed therapeutic, which could improve patient outcome. WES generates sequence data of the coding regions of the genome (representing approximately 1% of the human genome), rather than the entire genome (WGS).  Consequently, WES is less expensive than WGS. Noncoding variants can be identified using WGS but cannot be identified using WES. The use of WGS is limited by cost and the vast bioinformatics needed for interpretation. Although the costs of sequencing have dropped precipitously, the analysis remains formidable.[ ] Although the goal of WES and WGS is to improve patient care by detecting actionable genetic variants (mutations that can be targeted therapeutically), a number of issues warrant consideration.  This testing may detect pathogenic variants, variants of uncertain significance (VUS), or no detectable abnormalities. In addition, pathogenic variants can be found in genes that are thought to be clearly related to tumorigenesis but can also be detected in genes with unclear relevance (particularly with WES and WGS approaches). VUS have unclear implications as they may, or may not, disrupt the function of the protein. The definition of actionable can vary, but often this term is used when an aberration, if found, would lead to recommendations against certain treatments (such as variants in ) for which a clinical trial is available, or for which there is a known targeted drug. Although there are case reports of success with this approach, it is unlikely to be straightforward.  Studies are ongoing. Some commercial and single-institution assays test only the tumor. Clearly pathogenic variants found in important genes in the tumor can be somatic but could also be from the germline. In situations in which somatic analysis is paired with a germline analysis, it can be determined whether an identified alteration is inherited. A study that estimated the prevalence of germline variants from patients undergoing tumor sequencing with matched, normal DNA sequencing reported that cancer susceptibility genes were identified in 198 of 1,566 individuals (12.6%). Only 81 of these 198 individuals (40.9%) had pathogenic variants in cancer susceptibility genes concordant with their tumor type. When expanding to include known noncancer-related Mendelian disease genes, 246 of 1,566 individuals (15.7%) had pathogenic or presumed pathogenic germline variants identified.[ ] Sequencing tumors may lead to the identification of hereditary (germline) pathogenic variants.[ ] in well-characterized cancer susceptibility genes are highly suggestive of a germline pathogenic variant. Hypermutated tumor may suggest an underlying constitutional defect in DNA repair.  Clinical characteristics that fit with a particular , such as family history, young age at diagnosis, or specific tumor type, may also raise the suspicion of a germline variant correlating with a tumor variant.  A high variant allele fraction may also indicate a germline variant.  All of these factors signify a potential need for patients to undergo genetic counseling and to consider confirmatory germline genetic testing. The absence of a variant in a gene assessed as part of somatic testing does not rule out the presence of an inherited susceptibility.  All patients whose personal and family histories are suggestive of hereditary cancer should consider germline testing regardless of their somatic results. Ongoing clinical trials, such as the , are examining the value of somatic sequencing to find actionable targets.  Germline sequencing is occurring as a component of this study. The goal of germline testing is to identify pathogenic variants associated with an  inherited risk of cancer and to guide cancer risk–management decisions. Also, germline testing can aid in some management decisions at the time of diagnosis (e.g., decisions about colectomy in Lynch syndrome–related colon cancer and contralateral mastectomy in carriers of / pathogenic variants). In addition, there are emerging data that germline status may help determine systemic therapy (e.g., the use of cisplatin or poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase [PARP] inhibitors in / -related cancer). To date, most germline genetic testing has been performed in a targeted manner, looking for variants in the gene(s) associated with a clinical picture (e.g., and in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer; or the mismatch repair [MMR] genes in Lynch syndrome). However, targeted multigene tests now available commercially or within an institution contain different sets of genes. Some are targeted to all cancers, others to specific cancers (e.g.,  breast, colon, or prostate cancers). The genes on the multigene tests include high-penetrance genes related to the specific tumor (such as / on a breast cancer panel); high penetrance genes related to a different type of cancer but with a more moderate risk for the tumor of reference (such as or on a breast cancer panel); and moderate penetrance genes for which clinical utility is uncertain (such as on a breast cancer panel). Because multiple genes are included on these panels, it is anticipated that many, and perhaps most, individuals undergoing testing using these panels will be found to have at least one VUS. As it is not possible to do standard pretest counseling models for a panel of 20 genes, new counseling models are needed. Ethical issues of whether patients can opt out of specific results (such as or in breast cancer) and how this would be done in clinical practice are unresolved. Refer to the section in the PDQ summary on for more information about the use of targeted multigene tests. WES for inherited cancer susceptibility is also commercially available. Secondary findings are likely, and management of such findings is evolving. The ACCE model uses four main components to evaluate new genetic tests: analytic validity; clinical validity; clinical utility; and ethical, legal, and social issues.[ ] The ACCE model's framework has been adopted worldwide for the evaluation of genetic tests. Several layers of complexity exist in managing NGS in the clinical setting.  At the purely technical level, improvements in the sequencing technique have allowed for sequencing across the entire genome, not merely the exome.  As the costs decrease, exomic and genomic sequencing of tumor and normal tissue can be expected to become more routine. With routine use of WGS, major challenges in interpretation emerge.  Foremost is the matter of determining which sequence variations in known cancer predisposition genes are pathologic, which are harmless, and which variations require further evaluation as to  their significance.  This is not a new challenge. Various groups are developing processes for the interpretation and curation of a growing database of variants and their significance. For example, the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumors has developed such a process for the MMR genes in concert with the Human Variome Project and International Mismatch Repair Consortium. These processes may serve as a framework for the emerging challenge of interpreting the significance of sequence variations in genes of uncertain or unknown function in regulation of neoplastic progression or other diseases.  Larger cancer predisposition multigene tests have been developed by commercial laboratories, with their own process for interpretation.  To the extent that increasingly larger multigene tests include genes of unknown significance, governance of the interpretation process requires that academic institutions offering their own multigene tests or using external proprietary panels develop a deliberative process for managing the quality assurance for test performance (including Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments [CLIA], where appropriate) and interpretation. ACMG has issued the following updated guidelines for achieving accountability in interpreting and reporting secondary findings:[ , ] Concerns remain that the routine reporting of germline variants in the context of tumor sequencing would require laboratories to conduct results review with germline and tumor genome expertise, which would be expected to increase costs, laboratory efforts, and turnaround time for results reporting.  The nature of discussions between oncologists and patients would be altered to include the multiple facets involved with germline testing and potential results.  Pre- and post-test discussions would also potentially require involvement of genetic counselors and geneticists, who are a limited resource in oncology practices. Recent expert comment stated that more data are needed about the benefits of return of secondary germline findings to cancer patients undergoing tumor sequencing, citing a need for recommendations by experts in the oncology and genetics communities.[ ] It is still very early in the development processes for oversight at the institutional level.  As an example, at one high-volume cancer center, the following process has been used: Informed consent for the sequencing of highly penetrant disease genes has been conducted since the mid-1990s in the contexts of known or suspected inherited diseases within selected families. However, the best methods and  approaches for educating and counseling individuals about the potential benefits, limitations, and harms of genetic testing to facilitate informed decisions have not been fully elucidated or adequately tested. New informed consent challenges arise as NGS technologies are applied in clinical and research settings. Challenges to facilitating informed consent include the following: The increased availability and decreased cost of NGS technology are expanding the use of genome-wide testing of tumors, with the goal of identifying somatic mutations as potential targets for cancer treatment.  While identifying germline pathogenic variants may be considered secondary to the main purpose of testing tumors, the possibility of identifying actionable secondary findings of pathogenic variants in cancer predisposition genes supports the need for genetic counseling in this context.  Approaches for genetic counseling and informed consent in the context of tumor sequencing have been proposed.[ , ] Advances in genetic sequencing technologies have dramatically reduced the cost of sequencing an individual's full genome or exome. WGS and WES are increasingly being employed in the clinical setting in testing for both somatic mutations and germline variants. In addition, multigene tests are now available commercially or within an institution. Considerable debate surrounds the clinical, ethical, legal, and counseling aspects associated with NGS and gene panels. Future research is warranted to address these issues. PDQ cancer genetics summaries focus on the genetics of specific cancers, , and the ethical, social, and psychological implications of cancer genetics knowledge.  Sections on the genetics of specific cancers include syndrome-specific information on the risk implications of a family history of cancer, the prevalence and characteristics of cancer- , known modifiers of genetic risk, opportunities for genetic testing, outcomes of and testing, and interventions available for people with increased cancer risk resulting from an inherited predisposition. The source of medical literature cited in PDQ cancer genetics summaries is peer-reviewed scientific publications, the quality and reliability of which is evaluated in terms of levels of evidence.  Where relevant, the level of evidence is cited, or particular strengths of a study or limitations of the evidence are described. Refer to the summary for more information on the levels of evidence utilized in the PDQ cancer genetics summaries. Health care providers who deliver genetic services, including , can be located through local, regional, and national professional genetics organizations such as the .  Providers of cancer genetic services are not limited to one specialty and include medical geneticists, genetic counselors, advanced practice genetics nurses, oncologists (medical, radiation, or surgical), other surgeons, internists, pediatricians, family practitioners, and mental health professionals.  A cancer genetics health care provider will assist in constructing and evaluating a , eliciting and evaluating personal and family medical histories, and calculating and providing information about cancer risk and/or probability of a being associated with cancer in the family.  In addition, if a genetic test is available, these providers can assist in pretest counseling, laboratory selection, , test interpretation, posttest counseling, and follow-up.

ttle: Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers (PDQ®) - NCI
@: https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq?cid=eb_govdel
txt: This executive summary reviews the topics covered in this PDQ summary on the genetics of breast and gynecologic cancers. Factors suggestive of a include 1) an increased incidence of these cancers among individuals with a family history of these cancers;  2) multiple family members affected with these and other cancers;  and 3) a pattern of cancers compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance. Both males and females can inherit and transmit an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition gene. Additional factors coupled with family history can influence an individual's risk of developing cancer—such as , and , early in life, , and . Risk assessment models have been developed to clarify an individual's 1) ; 2) ; and 3) . Breast and ovarian cancer are present in several autosomal dominant cancer syndromes, although they are most strongly associated with highly penetrant germline pathogenic variants in . Other genes, such as , (associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome), (associated with hamartoma tumor syndromes, including Cowden syndrome), (associated with diffuse gastric and lobular breast cancer syndrome), and (associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome), confer a risk to either or both of these cancers with relatively high penetrance. Inherited endometrial cancer is most commonly associated with , a condition caused by inherited pathogenic variants in the highly penetrant mismatch repair genes , , , , and . Colorectal cancer (and, to a lesser extent, ovarian cancer and stomach cancer) is also associated with Lynch syndrome. , , , , and are moderate penetrance genes that are associated with increased breast and/or gynecologic cancer risk. are showing promise in identifying common, low-penetrance susceptibility alleles for many complex diseases, including breast and gynecologic cancers, but the clinical utility of these findings remains uncertain. , including breast magnetic resonance imaging and mammography, are commonly performed in carriers of pathogenic variants and in individuals at increased risk of breast cancer. Initiation of screening is generally recommended at earlier ages and at more frequent intervals in individuals with an increased risk due to genetics and family history than in the general population. There is evidence to demonstrate that these strategies have utility in early detection of cancer.  In contrast, there is currently no evidence to demonstrate that using cancer antigen–125  testing and transvaginal ultrasound leads to early detection of cancer. Risk-reducing surgeries, including (RRM) and (RRSO), have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer and improve overall survival in carriers of and pathogenic variants. and have been examined in this population. For example, use has been shown to reduce the risk of among carriers of and pathogenic variants after treatment for breast cancer, but there are limited data in the primary cancer prevention setting to suggest that it reduces the risk of breast cancer among healthy female carriers of pathogenic variants. The use of also has been associated with a protective effect on the risk of developing ovarian cancer, including in carriers of and pathogenic variants, with no association of increased risk of breast cancer when using formulations developed after 1975. influence decisions about genetic testing for inherited cancer risk and risk-management strategies. varies widely across studies. Psychological factors that have been associated with testing uptake include cancer-specific distress and perceived risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Studies have shown after genetic testing for both carriers and noncarriers, particularly in the longer term. also varies across studies and may be influenced by factors such as cancer history, age, family history, recommendations of the health care provider, and pretreatment genetic education and counseling. about an inherited risk of breast and gynecologic cancer is complex; gender, age, and the degree of relatedness are some elements that affect disclosure of this information. Research is ongoing to better understand and address psychosocial and behavioral issues in high-risk families. Among women in the  United States, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer after
nonmelanoma skin cancer, and it is the second leading cause of cancer deaths after
lung cancer.  In 2023, an estimated 300,590 new cases  of breast cancer (including 2,800 cases in men) will be diagnosed, and
43,700 deaths (including 530 deaths in men) will occur.[ ] The incidence of breast cancer, particularly for estrogen receptor (ER)–positive  cancers occurring after age 50 years, is declining and has declined at a faster rate since 2003. This may be temporally related to a decrease in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after early reports from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI).[ ] An estimated 19,710 new cases of ovarian cancer are expected in the United States in 2023, with an estimated 13,270 deaths. Ovarian cancer is the fifth most deadly cancer in women.[ ] An estimated 66,200 new cases of endometrial cancer are expected in the United States in 2023, with an estimated 13,030 deaths.[ ] (Refer to the PDQ summaries on ; ;  and for more information about breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer rates, diagnosis, and management.) A possible genetic contribution to both breast and ovarian cancer risk is indicated by the
increased incidence of these cancers among women with a family history (refer to the , , and sections below for more information), and by the observation of some families in which multiple family
members are with breast and/or ovarian cancer, in a pattern compatible with an inheritance of cancer susceptibility. Formal studies of families ( ) have subsequently proven the
existence of autosomal dominant predispositions to breast and ovarian cancer and have led to the
identification of several highly  as the cause
of inherited cancer risk in many families.  (Refer to the PDQ
summary for more information about linkage
analysis.) in these genes are rare in the general population and are estimated to account for no more
than 5% to 10% of breast and ovarian cancer cases overall.  It is likely that other
genetic factors contribute to the etiology of some of these cancers. This section discusses  factors that can modify an individual's  risk of developing breast cancer.  These risk factors can affect women  in the general population, women who have a family histories of breast cancer,  and women who carry pathogenic variants in breast cancer risk genes. For more information on breast cancer risk factors in the general population, see , and for more information on risks associated with pathogenic variants, see the section in and : Cancer Risks and Management. The following breast cancer risk factors are discussed in this section: These  factors can increase or decrease  breast cancer risk in all women. However,  they may affect breast cancer risk differently in women with increased breast cancer susceptibility  (i.e., women who have high-risk family histories and/or pathogenic variants in hereditary breast cancer genes).    Factors that increase breast cancer risk in the general population may lower breast cancer risk, increase breast cancer risk more than expected, or have no effect on breast cancer risk in women with high breast cancer susceptibility.  In some cases, these risk factors may affect high-risk women in the same way that they affect average-risk women.  Furthermore, modifying risk factors has a greater effect on the absolute breast cancer risk in women with high breast cancer susceptibility than in women with low breast cancer susceptibility.[ ] It is imperative that providers discuss breast cancer risk factors with high-susceptibility patients, since risk patterns deviate from those seen in women in the general population. Providers may also want to convey  whether these risk factors increase, decrease, or do not affect breast cancer risk in women with high breast cancer susceptibility, based on available evidence. This information may change how providers approach breast cancer risk management in women with high breast cancer susceptibility. Like other cancer types, breast cancer's  cumulative risk increases with age. As individuals age, they encounter more environmental exposures and accumulate genomic changes. Hence,  most breast cancers
occur after age 50 years.[ ] Women with pathogenic variants in breast cancer risk genes often develop breast cancer at younger ages than women with breast cancers. A family history of breast cancer is a well-established, consistent risk factor for breast cancer. Approximately 5% to 10% of women with breast cancer also had a
mother or sister with breast cancer in cross-sectional studies. About 10% to 20% of women had a (FDR) or a (SDR) with breast cancer.[ - ]  A pooled analysis of 38 studies showed that women had increased breast cancer risk when they had at least one FDR with breast cancer   (relative risk [RR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0–2.2).[ ] A large population-based study that used the Swedish Family Cancer Database found that women had a significantly increased risk of breast cancer when they had a mother or a sister with breast cancer.[ , , - ] The following factors can increase a woman's breast cancer risk: Furthermore, women with family histories of multiple breast cancers had higher hazard ratios (HRs) (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.6–2.9) than women who had a single breast cancer in their families (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.8–1.9). When women had multiple breast cancers in their families (with one breast cancer occurring before age 40 years), the HR was 3.8 (95% CI, 3.1–4.8).  However,  breast cancer risk also significantly increased when a relative was diagnosed with breast cancer at 60 years or older, suggesting that having a relative with breast cancer at any age can  increase risk.[ ] Another study in women with unilateral versus contralateral breast cancer (CBC) evaluated CBC risk among family members.[ ] Results indicated that  women with at least one affected FDR had an 8.1% chance of developing CBC after 10 years. Participants' risks also increased when relatives were diagnosed with breast cancer before age 40 years (10-year absolute risk [AR], 13.5%; 95% CI, 8.8%–20.8%) or if relatives had CBC (10-year AR, 14.1%; 95% CI, 9.5%–20.7%). These risks were similar to those seen among carriers (10-year AR, 18.4%; 95% CI, 16.0%–21.3%). These risk estimates remained unchanged when the analysis was restricted to women who tested negative for a pathogenic variant in / , , , or . Albright et al. addressed how affected (TDRs) can contribute to an individual's breast cancer risk.[ ] These researchers used the Utah Population Database and the Utah Cancer Registry to estimate RRs for participants to develop breast cancer. They collected family histories with  FDRs, SDRs, and TDRs and included both paternal and maternal relatives. They  confirmed that individuals with affected FDRs had the highest breast cancer risk, particularly if the FDR was diagnosed with breast cancer early in life. When participants had five or more affected TDRs (and no FDRs/SDRs with breast cancer), they had an RR of 1.32 (95% CI, 1.11–1.57). One of the largest studies of twins ever conducted examined 80,309 monozygotic twins and 123,382 dizygotic twins. This study had a estimate of 31% for breast cancer  (95% CI, 11%–51%).[ ]  If a monozygotic twin had breast cancer, her twin sister had a 28.1% chance of developing breast cancer (95% CI, 23.9%–32.8%), and if a dizygotic twin had breast cancer, her twin sister had a 19.9% chance of developing breast cancer (95% CI, 17%–23.2%).  These estimates suggest that monozygotic twins have  a 10% higher risk of developing breast cancer than dizygotic twins.  However, the high rate of discordance seen, even between monozygotic twins, suggests that environmental factors can also modify breast cancer risk. Reproductive history can also affect a woman's risk for ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. For more information, see the and sections. Breast cancer risk is one of the factors to consider when prescribing contraceptives, which assist with pregnancy control,  abnormal bleeding, and other gynecological symptoms. Oral contraceptives (OCs) may slightly increase breast cancer risk in
long-term users, but this appears to be a short-term effect.[ ] Some studies show that OC use does not further increase breast cancer risk in women with high breast cancer susceptibility. For example, a meta-analysis
with data from 54 studies  showed that women with family histories of breast cancer did not have increased  breast cancer risk from OC use.[ ] Although the data are not entirely consistent, a meta-analysis of pathogenic variant carriers concluded that breast cancer risk did not significantly increase when participants used OCs.[ ] More specifically, the International Carrier Cohort Study (IBCCS), the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer (kConFab) Follow-Up Study, and the Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR) did not report associations between OC use and increased breast cancer risk in women with pathogenic variants.[ ] In fact, OCs are sometimes recommended for ovarian cancer prevention in and pathogenic variant carriers. For more information, see the and sections. However, in the prospective analyses of the IBCCS, kConFab, and BCFR studies mentioned above, women with pathogenic variants had increased breast cancer risk when they took  OCs  (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.03–2.97).  Additionally, a systematic review of the published data concluded that it is unclear if OC use increases breast cancer risk in carriers due to inconsistencies across studies.[ ] Some studies also suggest that the year an OC was made and a woman's age when beginning OC use may matter. For example,  OCs made before 1975 are associated with increased  breast cancer risk in carriers (summary relative risk [SRR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.06–2.04).[ ] A case-control study of 2,492 matched pairs of women with a pathogenic variant also found that OC use significantly  increased breast cancer risk when women began using OCs prior to age 20 years (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20–1.75).[ ] Other contraceptive methods have not been studied in women with pathogenic variants in breast cancer risk genes. However, studies have investigated associations between intrauterine devices and breast cancer risk in the general population.  A meta-analysis and systematic review of seven studies examined the effect of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) on breast cancer risk. The meta-analysis included studies that controlled for family history of breast cancer, but associations were not separately evaluated or stratified by family history of breast cancer. In LNG-IUS users, breast cancer risk increased in all women (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06–1.28), in women younger than 50 years (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02–1.22), and in women 50 years and older (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.34–1.72).[ ] Both observational studies and randomized clinical trials have examined the association between postmenopausal HRT and breast cancer. Short-term use of HRT for treatment of postmenopausal symptoms appears to
confer little or no breast cancer risk.[ , ] A meta-analysis with data from 51
observational studies found a 1.35 RR for breast cancer  (95% CI, 1.21–1.49)
in women who used HRT for 5 or more years after menopause.[ ]  The , a randomized, controlled trial  of about 160,000 postmenopausal women, investigated the risks and benefits of HRT. The estrogen-plus-progestin arm of the study, in which more than 16,000 women were randomly assigned  to receive combined estrogen and progestin or placebo, was halted early because health risks exceeded  health benefits.[ , ]  Significant increases in both total  breast cancer cases (245 in the estrogen-plus-progestin group vs. 185 in the placebo group) and invasive breast cancer cases (199 in the estrogen-plus-progestin group vs. 150 in the placebo group) prompted early closure of the study (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.02–1.5; < .001).  Risks for coronary heart disease, stroke,  and pulmonary embolism also increased in the estrogen-plus-progestin group. The WHI study did not stratify data by participants' family histories of breast cancer, and subjects were not systematically tested for pathogenic variants.[ ] Similar findings were seen in the estrogen-progestin arm of the prospective,  observational Million Women’s Study in the United Kingdom.[ ]   However, breast cancer risk was not elevated in women randomly assigned  to the estrogen-only group when compared with those in the placebo group in the WHI study (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59–1.01). Hysterectomy was required for women to qualify for the  estrogen-only arm of this study; 40% of these patients also had a bilateral oophorectomy,  which can potentially decrease breast cancer risk.[ ] Among women with family histories of breast cancer, the associations between HRT and breast cancer risk have not been consistent. Some studies suggested risk was particularly elevated among women with  family histories of breast cancer, while others  did not report an interaction between these factors.[ - , ] 
A large meta-analysis found that women who used HRT had increased breast cancer risk. However, risk  did not differ significantly between subjects with or without family histories of cancer.[ ] The effect of HRT on breast cancer risk among carriers of and pathogenic variants has been studied in the context of  bilateral risk-reducing oophorectomy. Short-term HRT use does not  seem to alter an oophorectomy's protective effect on breast cancer risk.[ ]  For example, a prospective, longitudinal cohort study recruited carriers from 80 centers in 17 countries. This study found that HRT use after oophorectomy was not associated with increased breast cancer risk in carriers.[ ] The HR was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.62–1.52) for individuals who  used HRT when compared with individuals who had never used HRT. However, the effects of estrogen-only  HRT and estrogen-plus-progesterone HRT differed. After a 10-year follow-up period, the cumulative breast cancer incidence was 12% in women who used estrogen-only HRT and 22% in women who used estrogen-plus-progesterone HRT. These associations were stronger for women who underwent oophorectomy before age 45 years. The study concluded that using estrogen-only HRT after oophorectomy did not increase risk of -associated breast cancers. However, the potential harmful effects of progesterone-containing HRT warrant further study.[ ]  For more information, see the section in and : Cancer Risks and Management. HRT use may also increase a woman's chance of developing endometrial cancer. For more information, see the section. Radiation exposure can increase an individual's breast cancer risk. This is demonstrated by the survivors of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and by women who have received
therapeutic radiation treatments to the chest and upper body.  However, it is unclear how much radiation exposure affects breast cancer risk in women with high breast cancer  susceptibility. Early data suggested that carriers of and pathogenic variants may have increased sensitivity to
radiation, which may contribute to cancer susceptibility.[ - ] Studies have shown that individuals with germline and variants also have increased sensitivity to radiation.[ , ] It is possible that radiation exposure from diagnostic procedures, including mammography, poses
a greater risk to  women with high breast cancer susceptibility than to women who are at average risk of developing breast cancer. 
Therapeutic radiation could also increase cancer risk in women with high breast cancer susceptibility.  However, a cohort study of and pathogenic variant carriers treated with breast-conserving therapy did not show evidence of increased radiation sensitivity in participants. Sequelae were not observed in
the breasts, lungs, or bone marrow of carriers.[ ] Conversely,
tumors in women with  pathogenic variants in breast cancer risk genes may be more responsive to radiation treatment than tumors in women at average breast cancer risk.  Studies examining the impact of radiation exposure in carriers of and pathogenic variants have had conflicting results.[ - ] A large European study showed a dose-response relationship, in which breast cancer risk increased with total radiation exposure. However,   this occurred most often when patients had  nonmammographic radiation exposure before age 20 years.[ ]  A significant association was not observed between prior mammography exposure and breast cancer risk in a prospective study of 1,844 carriers and 502 carriers without breast cancer diagnoses upon study entry. The average follow-up period in this study was 5.3 years.[ ] A retrospective cohort study estimated the effect of adjuvant radiation therapy (for primary breast cancer) on  CBC risk in and carriers (N, 691; median follow-up period, 8.6 y).[ ] An association was not found between radiation therapy  and CBC risk  (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.45–1.45). This was also true in patients who were younger than 40 years when they were diagnosed with their primary breast cancers (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.60–3.09). A study examined the impact of radiation therapy on CBC risk in , , and 1100delC carriers. CBC risk was not modified by radiation therapy,  even though these women  had a higher baseline risk of CBC than women in the general population ( pathogenic variant carriers without radiation therapy: RR, 3.52; 95% CI, 1.76–7.01; pathogenic variant carriers with radiation therapy: RR, 4.46; 95% CI, 2.96–6.71).[ ]  Thus, it is important to differentiate individuals with increased  CBC  risk due to pathogenic variants from individuals with increased CBC risk due to radiation therapy. For more information, see the section in and : Cancer Risks and Management. The risk of breast cancer increases by approximately 10% for each 10 g of daily alcohol intake (approximately one drink or less) in the general population.[ , ]  Prior studies of pathogenic variant carriers have  not found an association between alcohol consumption and increased breast cancer risk.[ - ] The association between  cigarette smoking and breast cancer risk in women with pathogenic variants is  inconclusive.[ , ] Recent studies have evaluated the association between alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, and breast cancer risk in individuals  with pathogenic variants or family histories of breast cancer. One study evaluated if tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption are associated with increased breast cancer risk in and carriers  using pooled data from an international cohort.[ ]  This study did not find an association between alcohol consumption and increased breast cancer risk in and carriers. Parous carriers who smoked for more than 5 years before their first full-term pregnancy had a significantly increased  breast cancer risk when compared with parous carriers who did not smoke. A prospective study evaluating a cohort of women with  family histories of breast cancer found that alcohol consumption was associated with an increased number of ER-positive breast cancers in women at the lowest quantile of absolute breast cancer risk (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.07–1.99).[ ]  Cigarette smoking was also associated with increased breast cancer risk in those at the highest quantile of absolute breast cancer risk. Increased physical activity has been associated with reduced breast cancer risk in most epidemiological studies.  This risk  reduction has also been seen in studies of female or pathogenic variant carriers.  For example, one study reported a 38%  reduction in premenopausal breast cancer risk from moderate physical activity (OR for the top quartile of physical activity compared with the lowest level, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40–0.96).[ ]  This reduction in breast cancer risk has been seen in women with varying levels of breast cancer susceptibility, including  women who  have family histories of breast cancer  but do not have known or pathogenic variants.[ ] Refer to the PDQ summary on for information about risk factors for ovarian cancer in the general population. Ovarian cancer incidence rises in a linear fashion from age 30 years to age 50 years and continues to increase, though at a slower rate, thereafter.   Before age 30 years, the risk of developing epithelial ovarian cancer is remote, even in hereditary cancer families.[ ] Although reproductive, demographic, and lifestyle
factors affect risk of ovarian cancer, the single greatest ovarian cancer risk
factor is a family history of the disease.  A large meta-analysis of 15 published studies estimated an  OR of 3.1 for the risk of ovarian cancer associated with at least one FDR with ovarian cancer.[ ] Nulliparity is consistently associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, including among carriers of / pathogenic variants, yet a meta-analysis identified a risk reduction only in women with four or more live births.[ ]  Risk may also be increased among women who have used fertility drugs, especially those who remain nulligravid.[ , ] Several studies have reported a risk reduction in ovarian cancer after OC use in carriers of / pathogenic variants;[ - ] a risk reduction has also been shown after tubal ligation in carriers, with a statistically significant decreased risk of 22% to 80% after the procedure.[ , ]
  Breastfeeding for more than 12 months may also be associated with a reduction in ovarian cancer among carriers of / pathogenic variants.[ ] On the other hand, evidence is growing that the use of menopausal HRT is associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, particularly in long-time users and users of sequential estrogen-progesterone schedules.[ - ] Bilateral tubal ligation and hysterectomy are associated with reduced ovarian cancer risk,[ , , ] including in carriers of / pathogenic variants.[ ] Ovarian cancer risk is reduced more than 90% in women with documented or pathogenic variants who chose risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO).  In this same population, risk-reducing oophorectomy also resulted in a nearly 50% reduction in the risk of subsequent breast cancer.[ , ] While some studies have shown more benefit for breast cancer reduction in patients with versus pathogenic variants, others have shown no benefit for carriers.  Additionally, many of the studies remain underpowered to demonstrate benefit.[ ]  (Refer to the section in and : Cancer Risks and Management for more information about these studies.) Use of OCs for 4 or more years is associated with an approximately 50% reduction in ovarian cancer risk in the general population.[ , ] A majority of, but not all, studies also support OCs being protective among carriers of / pathogenic variants.[ , - ] A meta-analysis of 18 studies including 13,627 carriers of pathogenic variants reported a significantly reduced risk of ovarian cancer (SRR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33–0.75) associated with OC use.[ ] (Refer to the section in and : Cancer Risks and Management.) Refer to the PDQ summary on for information about risk factors for endometrial cancer in the general population. Age is an important risk factor for endometrial cancer.  Most women with endometrial cancer are diagnosed after menopause.   Only 15% of women are diagnosed with endometrial cancer before age 50 years, and fewer than 5% are diagnosed before age 40 years.[ ]
 Women with Lynch syndrome tend to develop endometrial cancer at an earlier age, with the median age at diagnosis of 48 years.[ ] Although the hyperestrogenic state is the most common predisposing factor for endometrial cancer, family history also plays a significant role in a woman’s risk for disease. Approximately 3%  to 5% of uterine cancer cases are attributable to a hereditary cause,[ ] with the main hereditary endometrial cancer syndrome being Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic condition with a population prevalence of 1 in 300 to 1 in 1,000 individuals.[ , ] (Refer to the section in Genetics of Colorectal Cancer for more information.) Non-Lynch syndrome genes may also contribute to endometrial cancer risk. In an unselected endometrial cancer cohort undergoing , approximately 3% of patients tested positive for a in non-Lynch syndrome genes, including , , , , , , , , , and .[ ] Notably, patients with pathogenic variants in non-Lynch syndrome genes were more likely to have serous tumor histology than were patients without pathogenic variants. Furthermore, although the overall risk of endometrial cancer after RRSO was not increased among carriers of pathogenic variants, these patients seemed to have an increased risk of serous and serous-like endometrial cancer.[ ]

These findings were supported by a Dutch multicenter cohort study in women with germline and pathogenic variants. This study concluded that participants' AR for endometrial cancer was approximately 3%. Because some serous and p53-aberrant endometrial cancers may harbor germline or somatic / mutations, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor  therapy may also be a therapeutic option.[ ] Reproductive factors such as multiparity, late menarche, and early menopause decrease the risk of endometrial cancer because of the lower cumulative exposure to estrogen and the higher relative exposure to progesterone.[ , ] Hormonal factors that increase the risk of type I endometrial cancer are better understood. All endometrial cancers share a predominance of estrogen relative to progesterone. Prolonged exposure to estrogen or unopposed estrogen increases the risk of endometrial cancer.  Endogenous exposure to estrogen can result from obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, and nulliparity, while exogenous estrogen can result from taking unopposed estrogen or tamoxifen. Unopposed estrogen increases the risk of developing endometrial cancer by twofold to twentyfold,  proportional to the duration of use.[ , ]  Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, acts as an estrogen agonist on the endometrium while acting as an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue, and  increases the risk of endometrial cancer.[ ]  In contrast, OCs, the LNG-IUS, and combination estrogen-progesterone HRT all reduce the risk of endometrial cancer through the antiproliferative effect of progesterone acting on the endometrium.[ - ] Autosomal dominant inheritance of breast and gynecologic cancers is characterized by transmission of
cancer from generation to generation, through either the mother’s or the father’s
side of the family, with the following characteristics: Breast and ovarian cancer are components of several autosomal dominant cancer syndromes. The syndromes most strongly associated with both cancers are the syndromes associated with or pathogenic variants.  Breast cancer is also a common feature of due to pathogenic variants and of due to pathogenic variants.[ ] Other genetic syndromes that may include breast cancer as an associated feature include heterozygous carriers of the gene  and . Ovarian cancer has also been associated with , basal cell nevus (Gorlin) syndrome, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.[ ] Lynch syndrome is mainly associated with colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer, although several studies have demonstrated that patients with Lynch syndrome are also at risk of developing transitional cell carcinoma of the ureters and renal pelvis; cancers of the stomach, small intestine, liver and biliary tract, brain, breast, prostate, and adrenal cortex; and sebaceous skin tumors (Muir-Torre syndrome).[ - ] pathogenic variants in the genes responsible for these autosomal dominant cancer syndromes produce different clinical of characteristic malignancies and, in some instances, associated nonmalignant abnormalities. The family characteristics that suggest hereditary cancer predisposition include the following: and depict some of the classic inheritance features of a and pathogenic variant, respectively. depicts a classic family with Lynch syndrome. For more information about pedigree nomenclature, see the section in Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling. There are no features distinguishing breast and ovarian cancers occurring in carriers of or pathogenic variants from those occurring in . Breast cancers occurring in carriers of pathogenic variants are more likely to be ER-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)–negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor two (HER2/neu)–negative (i.e., [TNBC]), and have a basal phenotype. -associated ovarian cancers are more likely to be high-grade and of serous histopathology.  (Refer to the and sections in and : Cancer Risks and Management for more information.) Some pathologic features distinguish carriers of Lynch syndrome–associated pathogenic variants from noncarriers. The hallmark feature of endometrial cancers occurring in Lynch syndrome is mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies, including the presence of (MSI), and the absence of specific MMR proteins. In addition to these molecular changes, there are also histologic changes including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, peritumoral lymphocytes, undifferentiated tumor histology, lower uterine segment origin, and synchronous tumors. The accuracy and completeness of family histories must be considered when they are used to assess risk.  A reported family history may be erroneous, or a person may be unaware of relatives affected with cancer.  In
addition, small family sizes and premature deaths may limit the information
obtained from a family history.  Breast or ovarian cancer on the
paternal side of the family usually involves more distant relatives than does breast or ovarian cancer on the
maternal side, so information  may be more difficult to obtain.
When self-reported information is compared with independently verified cases, the of a history of breast cancer is relatively high, at 83% to 97%, but lower for ovarian cancer, at 60%.[ , ] Additional  limitations of relying on family histories include adoption; families with a small number of women; limited access to family history information; and incidental removal of the uterus, ovaries, and/or fallopian tubes for noncancer indications.  Family histories will evolve; therefore, it is important to update family histories from both parents over time. (Refer to the section in  Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling for more information.) Models to predict an individual’s lifetime risk of developing breast and/or gynecologic cancer are available.[ - ]  In addition, models exist to predict an individual’s likelihood of having a pathogenic variant in , , or one of the MMR genes associated with Lynch syndrome. (Refer to the section of this summary for more information about some of these models.) Not all models can be appropriately applied to all patients.   Each model is  appropriate only when the patient’s characteristics and family history are similar to those of the study population on which the model was based.  Different models may provide widely varying risk estimates for the same clinical scenario, and the validation of these estimates has not been performed for many models.[ , , ] In general, breast cancer models are designed for two types of populations: 1) women without a pathogenic variant or strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer; and 2) women at higher risk because of a personal or family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer.[ ] Models designed for women of the first type (e.g., the Gail model, which is the basis for the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment 
Tool [BCRAT] [ ], and the Colditz and Rosner model [ ]) require only limited information about family history (e.g., number of FDRs with breast cancer). Models designed for women at higher risk require more detailed information about personal and family cancer history of breast and ovarian cancers, including ages at onset of cancer and/or carrier status of specific breast cancer-susceptibility . The genetic factors used by the latter models differ, with some assuming one risk (e.g., the Claus model [ ]), others assuming two loci (e.g., the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study [IBIS] model [ ] and the BRCAPRO model [ ]), and still others assuming an additional polygenic component in addition to multiple loci (e.g., the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm [BOADICEA] model [ - ]). The models also differ in whether they include information about nongenetic risk factors.   Three models (Gail/BCRAT, Pfeiffer,[ ] and IBIS) include nongenetic risk factors but differ in the risk factors they include (e.g., the Pfeiffer model includes alcohol consumption, whereas the Gail/BCRAT does not).  These models have limited ability to discriminate between individuals who are affected and those who are unaffected with cancer; a model with high discrimination would be close to 1, and a model with little discrimination would be close to 0.5; the discrimination of the models currently ranges between 0.56 and 0.63).[ ]
The existing models generally are more accurate  in prospective studies that have assessed how well they predict future cancers.[ , - ]  An analysis comparing the 10-year performance of the BOADICEA, BRCAPRO, BCRAT, and IBIS models demonstrated superiority of the models with more detailed pedigree inclusion—specifically, BOADICEA and IBIS.[ ] In the United States, BRCAPRO, the Claus model,[ , ] and the Gail/BCRAT [ ] are widely used in clinical . Risk estimates derived from the models differ for an individual patient. Several other models that include more detailed family history information are also in use and are discussed below. The Gail model is the basis for the , a computer program available from the National Cancer Institute by calling the Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237). This version of the Gail model estimates only the risk of invasive breast cancer.  The Gail/BCRAT model has been found to be reasonably accurate at predicting breast cancer risk in large groups of White women who undergo annual screening mammography; however, reliability varies depending on the cohort studied.[ - ]   Risk can be overestimated in the following populations: The Gail/BCRAT model is valid for women aged 35 years and older. The model was primarily developed for White women.[ ] Extensions of the Gail model for African American women have been subsequently developed to calibrate risk estimates using data from more than 1,600 African American women with invasive breast cancer and more than 1,600 controls.[ ] Additionally, extensions of the Gail model have incorporated high-risk (SNVs) and pathogenic variants; however, no software exists to calculate risk in these extended models.[ , ] Other risk assessment models incorporating breast density have been developed but are not ready for clinical use.[ , ] Generally, the Gail/BCRAT model should not be the sole model used for families with one or more of the following characteristics: Commonly used models that incorporate family history include the IBIS, BOADICEA, and BRCAPRO models. The IBIS/Tyrer-Cuzick model incorporates both genetic and nongenetic factors.[ ] A three-generation pedigree is used to estimate the likelihood that an individual carries either a pathogenic variant or a hypothetical low-penetrance gene. In addition, the model incorporates personal risk factors such as parity, body mass index (BMI); height; and age at menarche, first live birth, menopause, and HRT use. Both genetic and nongenetic factors are combined to develop a risk estimate. The BOADICEA model examines family history to estimate breast cancer risk and also incorporates both and non- genetic risk factors.[ ] The most important difference between BOADICEA and the other models using information on is that BOADICEA assumes an additional polygenic component in addition to multiple loci,[ - ] which is more in line with what is known about the underlying genetics of breast cancer. The BOADICEA model has also been expanded to include additional pathogenic variants, including , , and .[ ] However, the discrimination and calibration for these models differ significantly when compared in independent samples;[ ] the IBIS and BOADICEA models are more comparable when estimating risk over a shorter fixed time horizon (e.g., 10 years),[ ] than when estimating remaining lifetime risk.  As all risk assessment models for cancers are typically validated over a shorter time horizon (e.g., 5 or 10 years), fixed time horizon estimates rather than remaining lifetime risk may be more accurate and useful measures to convey in a clinical setting. In addition, readily available models that provide information about an individual woman’s risk in relation to  the population-level risk depending on her risk factors may be useful in a clinical setting (e.g., ).  Although this tool was developed using information about average-risk women and does not calculate AR estimates, it still may be useful when counseling women about cancer prevention.   Risk assessment models are being developed and validated in large cohorts to integrate genetic and nongenetic data, breast density, and other biomarkers. Although most breast cancer risk models have been shown to be well calibrated overall, model performance can be different for subgroups of women.  In particular, independent, prospective validation of risk models for women who tested negative for or pathogenic variants supported that the most commonly used clinical risk models underpredicted risk for this group of women.[ ]  The performance also differed on the basis of whether the test results of relatives were known. The models also underpredicted risk by 26.3% to 56.7% in women who tested negative but whose relatives had not been tested. Two risk prediction models have been developed for ovarian cancer.[ , ]
   The Rosner model [ ]
 included age at menopause, age at menarche, oral contraception use, and tubal ligation; the concordance statistic was 0.60 (0.57–0.62).   The Pfeiffer model [ ]
 included oral contraceptive use, menopausal HRT use, and family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer, with a similar discriminatory power of 0.59 (0.56–0.62).  Although both models were well calibrated, their modest discriminatory power limited their screening potential. The Pfeiffer model has been used to predict endometrial cancer risk in the general population.[ ] For endometrial cancer, the RR model included BMI, menopausal HRT use, menopausal status, age at menopause, smoking status, and OC use. The discriminatory power of the model was 0.68 (0.66–0.70); it overestimated observed endometrial cancers in most subgroups but underestimated disease in women with the highest BMI category, in premenopausal women, and in women taking menopausal HRT for 10 years or more. In contrast, MMRpredict, PREMM5 (PREdiction Model for gene Mutations), and MMRpro are three quantitative predictive models used to identify individuals who may potentially have Lynch syndrome.[ - ] MMRpredict incorporates only colorectal cancer patients but does include MSI and immunohistochemistry (IHC) tumor testing results. PREMM5 is an update of PREMM (1,2,6) and includes each of the five genes associated with Lynch syndrome, including and . It accounts for other Lynch syndrome–associated tumors but does not include tumor testing results.[ ] MMRpro incorporates tumor testing and germline testing results, but is more time intensive because it includes affected and unaffected individuals in the risk-quantification process.  All three predictive models are comparable to the traditional Amsterdam and Bethesda criteria in identifying individuals with colorectal cancer who carry MMR gene pathogenic variants.[ ]
However, because these models were developed and validated in colorectal cancer patients, the discriminative abilities of these models to identify Lynch syndrome are lower among individuals with endometrial cancer than among those with colon cancer.[ ]
In fact, the sensitivity and of MSI and IHC in identifying carriers of pathogenic variants are considerably higher than the prediction models and support the use of molecular tumor testing to screen for Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer. summarizes salient aspects of breast and gynecologic cancer risk assessment models that are commonly used in the clinical setting.  These models differ by the extent of family history included, whether nongenetic risk factors are included, and whether carrier status and polygenic risk are included (inputs to the models). The models also differ in the type of risk estimates that are generated (outputs of the models).  These factors may be relevant in choosing the model that best applies to a particular individual. Many models have been developed to predict the probability of identifying germline pathogenic variants in individuals or families. These models include those using logistic regression,[ , - ] genetic models using Bayesian analysis (BRCAPRO and BOADICEA),[ , ] and empiric observations.[ - ] In addition to BOADICEA, BRCAPRO is commonly used for genetic counseling in the clinical setting.  BRCAPRO and BOADICEA predict the probability of being a carrier and produce estimates of breast cancer risk (refer to ).  The discrimination and accuracy (factors used to evaluate the  performance of prediction models) of these models are much higher for their ability to report on carrier status than for their ability to predict fixed or remaining lifetime risk. BOADICEA is a polygenetic model that uses complex to examine both breast cancer risk and the probability of having a or pathogenic variant.[ ] Even among experienced providers, the use of prediction models has been shown to increase the power to discriminate which patients are most likely to be carriers of pathogenic variants.[ , ]  Most models do not include other cancers seen in the and spectrum, such as pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer. Interventions that decrease the likelihood that an individual will develop cancer (such as oophorectomy and mastectomy) may influence the ability to predict and pathogenic variant status.[ ] One study has shown that the prediction models for genetic risk are sensitive to the amount of family history data available and do not perform as well with limited family information.[ ] BOADICEA is being expanded to incorporate additional risk variants ( [GWAS] and SNVs)  to better predict pathogenic variant status and to improve  the accuracy of  breast cancer and ovarian cancer risk estimates.[ ] The performance of the models can vary in specific ethnic groups. The BRCAPRO model appeared to best fit a series of French Canadian families.[ ] There have been variable results in the performance of the BRCAPRO model among Hispanic individuals,[ , ] and both the BRCAPRO model and Myriad tables underestimated the proportion of carriers of pathogenic variants in an Asian American population.[ ] BOADICEA was developed and validated in British women.  Thus, the major models used for both overall risk ( ) and genetic risk ( ) have not been developed or validated in large populations of racially and ethnically diverse women.  Of the commonly used clinical models for assessing genetic risk, only the Tyrer-Cuzick model contains nongenetic risk factors. The power of several of the models has been compared in different studies.[ - ] Four breast cancer genetic-risk models, BOADICEA, BRCAPRO, IBIS, and eCLAUS, were evaluated for their diagnostic accuracy in predicting pathogenic variants in a cohort of 7,352 German families.[ ]  The family member with the highest likelihood of carrying a pathogenic variant from each family was screened for pathogenic variants.  Carrier probabilities from each model were calculated and compared with the actual variants detected.  BRCAPRO and BOADICEA had significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than IBIS or eCLAUS.  Accuracy for the BOADICEA model was further improved when statuses of the tumor markers ER, PR, and HER2/neu were included in the model. The inclusion of these biomarkers has been shown to improve the performance of BRCAPRO.[ , ] Genetic testing for and pathogenic variants has been available to the public since 1996.  As more individuals have undergone testing, risk assessment models have improved.  This, in turn, gives providers better data to estimate an individual patient’s risk of carrying a pathogenic variant, but risk assessment continues to be an art.  There are factors that might limit the ability to provide an accurate risk assessment (i.e., small family size, paucity of women, or ethnicity) including the specific circumstances of the individual patient (such as history of disease or risk-reducing surgeries). Several professional organizations and expert panels—including the American Society of Clinical Oncology,[ ] the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN),[ ] the American Society of Human Genetics,[ ]  the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics,[ ] the National Society of Genetic Counselors,[ ] the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force,[ ] and the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists [ ] —have developed clinical criteria and practice guidelines that can be helpful to health care providers in identifying individuals who may have a or pathogenic variant. In 2019, the American Society of Breast Surgeons published a recommendation to make genetic testing for “ / , and , with other genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history” available to all breast cancer patients.[ ]  This recommendation was based on a study that suggested similar pathogenic variant rates identified through an extended multigene panel in patients with breast cancer who did or did not meet the NCCN guidelines for genetic testing.[ ]   This study had  important methodologic challenges that need to be considered, including exclusion of participants previously tested, uncertain accuracy of the reported risk criteria for study participants, inclusion of genes with uncertain management guidelines, and difference in the specific genes in which pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified across the two groups.  For example, there was a statistically significant difference between participants who met and who did not meet NCCN criteria in the detection of / variants. Other studies have also found that the NCCN criteria have good sensitivity when predicting / variants; however, less is known about many other genes.  For example, one study showed that the NCCN criteria were able to detect 88.9% of the / pathogenic variant carriers [ ] and others have found that, if more than one NCCN criterion is met, then the does pass the 10% threshold (e.g., 12% for more than two NCCN criteria).[ ] As the cost of genetic testing continues to decrease, there is a need for unbiased evidence to guide indications for testing, including the cost-benefit impact on screening, prevention, and treatment. Efforts to generate less biased evidence include a single institution study of 3,907 unselected women with breast cancer tested for nine breast cancer genes, including / , , , , , , , and .[ ]  The study assessed the relative performance of NCCN genetic testing criteria as compared with the American Society of Breast Surgeons' recommendation to test all women aged 65 years or younger with breast cancer. The sensitivity of the criteria was defined as the proportion of individuals who met testing criteria and tested positive for a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant of the total population of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant carriers in the study, while the specificity was defined as the proportion of individuals who did not meet testing criteria and tested negative for a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant of the total population of noncarriers in the study. High sensitivity and specificity are both important considerations; however, higher sensitivity leads to lower specificity, so it is important to balance these two factors.
Detection of / pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants based on NCCN criteria had a sensitivity of 87% with a specificity of 53.5%; when expanded to the nine genes included in the study, sensitivity was 70% and specificity was 53.2%. When including all women diagnosed with breast cancer at age 65 or younger, the sensitivity to detect / pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants increased to 98%, while the specificity dropped to 22%.  Among those who did not meet NCCN criteria, 0.7% had pathogenic or likely pathogenic / variants. Another study to assess frequency of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants among breast cancer patients included a nested case-control study conducted through the WHI cohort among women with (cases) and without (controls) invasive breast cancer. Participants were tested for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in ten breast cancer–associated genes, including / .[ ] The prevalence of pathogenic or likely pathogenic / variants among those diagnosed with invasive breast cancer before age 65 years was 2.21%, compared with 1.09% among those diagnosed at age 65 years or older. In comparison, the frequency of pathogenic or likely pathogenic / variants was 0.22% in the control group. Current genetic testing criteria detect pathogenic variants. Although higher sensitivity is always desired, it is at the expense of specificity. Lower specificity leads to higher costs to achieve one positive genetic test. At the time of a new cancer diagnosis, genetic testing for inherited cancer predisposition may guide patient care  including decisions about surgery, chemotherapy and other biologics, and radiation treatment.[ , ] Among high-risk patients, the option of genetic testing   is an important part of the shared decision-making process regarding cancer treatments at the time of diagnosis. Tools are available to facilitate decision making about genetic testing in this context.[ ] Benefits of offering genetic testing at the time of breast cancer diagnosis include, but are not limited to, the following: Benefits of offering genetic testing at the time of ovarian cancer diagnosis include, but are not limited to, the following: Benefits of offering genetic testing at the time of endometrial cancer diagnosis include, but are not limited to, the following: Since the availability of and the Supreme Court of the United States ruling that human genes cannot be patented, several clinical laboratories now offer genetic testing through multigene panels at a cost comparable to that of single-gene testing. Even testing for and is a limited panel test of two genes. Approximately 25% of all ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancers are caused by a heritable genetic condition. Of these, about one-quarter (6% of all ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancers) are caused by genes other than and , including many genes associated with the Fanconi anemia pathway or otherwise involved with homologous recombination.[ ]

 In a population of ovarian cancer patients who test negative for and pathogenic variants, multigene panel testing can reveal actionable pathogenic variants.[ - ] In general, multigene panel testing increases the yield of non- pathogenic variants across a variety of populations.[ , - ] In an unselected population of breast cancer patients, the prevalence of and pathogenic variants was 6.1%,  while the prevalence of pathogenic variants in  other breast/ovarian cancer–predisposing genes was 4.6%.[ ] In an unselected population of endometrial cancer patients, the prevalence of Lynch syndrome pathogenic variants ( , , , , and ) was 5.8%; the prevalence of pathogenic variants in other actionable genes was 3.4%.[ ] Similarly, in a study of 35,409 women with breast cancer tested with the Myriad 25-gene panel, a pathogenic variant was found in 9.3% of women.[ ] Among that 9.3%, 48.5% of the women carried a pathogenic variant in or . The majority of other breast cancer genes with pathogenic variants identified included (11.7%), (9.7%), and (9.3%). The prevalence of pathogenic variants in the other breast cancer genes on the panel ranged from 0.05% to 0.31%. Pathogenic variants in Lynch syndrome genes accounted for 7.0% of variants identified; 3.7% were found in other genes included in the panel. The rate of pathogenic variants was higher in women with  TNBC diagnosed before age 40 years. A similar trend of identifying pathogenic variants in non- susceptibility genes in male breast cancer patients has also been described.[ ] In two studies of women who had previously tested negative for / , reflex testing with a multigene panel identified pathogenic variants in additional genes among 8% to 11% of cases.[ , ] In a study of 77,085 patients with breast cancer and 6,001 patients with ovarian cancer, 24.1% and 30.9% had genetic testing, respectively.  Of those tested, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in 7.8% of patients with breast cancer and 14.5% of patients with ovarian cancer. Prevalent non- pathogenic variants identified in patients with breast cancer included (1.6%), (1.0%), (0.7%), and (0.4%). In patients with ovarian cancer, non- pathogenic variants included (1.4%), (0.9%), (0.8%), and (0.6%).[ ] The potential utility of genetic testing in patients with ovarian tumors of all histologies was suggested in a study using a 32-gene panel that found 13.2% of 4,439 tumors harbored a pathogenic variant. Rates were highest among those with serous ovarian carcinoma (14.7%), although likely pathogenic variants were also seen in those with other histologies (borderline, germ cell, and sex cord stromal tumors), the significance of which is unclear to clinical management or etiology of disease.[ ] Multi-gene panel testing was conducted as part of two large efforts led by the worldwide Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) [ ]  and the United States–based CARRIERS consortium.[ ] The BCAC study tested 113,927 women  for 34 inherited cancer genes, while the CARRIERS study  tested 64,791 women for 28 hereditary cancer genes. In both studies, significant associations were reported between  eight genes and breast cancer development ( , , , , , , , and ). Associations were only reported between and breast cancer development in the BCAC study. Similarly, associations were only reported between and breast cancer development  in the CARRIERS study. Both and (which are established breast cancer risk genes that are linked to early-onset disease) were not significantly associated with breast cancer development in these studies. This is presumably because and pathogenic variants are very rare. NCCN recommends that women  diagnosed with TNBC  undergo / , , , , , and testing to guide treatment decisions at any age.[ ]  A large study utilizing multigene (panel) testing comprising two separate cohorts reported that, in addition to / genes, six other breast cancer susceptibility genes were also related to a higher risk of TNBC.  Specifically, pathogenic variants in , , and , in addition to and , were each associated with more than a fivefold increase in breast cancer.[ ]  Pathogenic variants in three other genes — , , and — were each associated with an increased TNBC risk of more than twofold.  Pathogenic variants in these eight genes were reported in 12% of the TNBC cases (8.3% / , 3.7% non- / ).   The study was conducted in a clinical testing cohort of 140,449 individuals (8,753 TNBC cases) who received genetic testing using a 21-gene panel (sample A).  In addition, a second sample (sample B) examined gene frequency rates in a pooled consortium of 2,143 individuals using a 17-gene panel.  The overall frequency of pathogenic variants in the 21 genes examined in sample A was 14.4% (8.4% / , 6.0% non- / ).  The two samples had very consistent findings with respect to the risk estimates despite differences in age, race, ethnicity, and family history of cancer with sample A being younger, more racially and ethnically diverse, and more likely to have a family history of cancer.   The pathogenic variant frequency detection in these 21 genes was also similar for White individuals (14% overall, 7.8% / , 6.2% non- / ) and African American individuals (14.6% overall,  9.0% / , 5.6% non- / ). Multi-gene panel testing studies were conducted in women from the United States who had African ancestry, and results showed that certain genes were associated with increased breast cancer risk in this population. These genes were similar to the breast cancer risk genes found in individuals from the United States with European ancestry. A case-control study of 10,047 women with African ancestry found a pathogenic variant frequency of 10.3% in those with ER-negative breast cancer, 5.2% in those with ER-positive breast cancer, and 2.3% in  those without breast cancer. (OR, 47), (OR, 7.25) and (OR, 8.54) were associated with the highest breast cancer risks.[ ] High ER-negative breast cancer risk was reported in individuals with pathogenic variants in (OR, 7.82), while moderate ER-positive breast cancer risk was reported in individuals with pathogenic variants in , , , and . Similarly, a case-control study of 3,286 women with African ancestry found significant associations between breast cancer risk and pathogenic variants in the following genes: , , , , , , , , and .[ ] There are caveats of multigene testing. Genes identified as part of multigene panel testing can be associated with varied breast cancer risk or confer no known risk.[ ] There is also the possibility of finding a (VUS). Even within a given gene, there may be differential risks on the basis of specific pathogenic variants.[ ] A large population-based retrospective study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data from Georgia and Los Angeles, California, found that multigene testing led to a twofold increase in the detection of pathogenic variants compared with -only testing in women with breast cancer.[ ]  VUS rates, however, were tenfold higher in the multigene panels, especially in African American women (44.5%) and Asian women (50.9%).  Many centers now offer a multigene panel test instead of just and testing if there is a concerning family history of syndromes other than hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, or more importantly, to gain as much genetic information as possible with one test, particularly if there may be insurance limitations. (Refer to the section in Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling for more information about multigene testing, including genetic education and counseling considerations and research examining the use of multigene testing.) The proportion of individuals carrying a who will manifest a certain disease is referred to as . In general, common that are associated with cancer susceptibility have a lower penetrance than rare genetic variants. This is depicted in . For adult-onset diseases, penetrance is usually described by the individual age, sex, and organ site. For example, the penetrance for breast cancer in female carriers of pathogenic variants is often quoted by age 50 years and by age 70 years. Of the numerous methods for estimating penetrance, none are without potential biases, and determining an individual carrier's risk of cancer involves some level of imprecision. Throughout this summary, we discuss studies that report on relative and absolute risks (ARs).  These are two important but different concepts.  Relative risk (RR) refers to an estimate of risk relative to another group (e.g., risk of an outcome like breast cancer for women who are exposed to a risk factor to the risk of breast cancer for women who are unexposed to the same risk factor). RR measures that are greater than 1 mean that the risk for those captured in the numerator (i.e., the exposed) is higher than the risk for those captured in the denominator (i.e., the unexposed).  RR measures that are less than 1 mean that the risk for those captured in the numerator (i.e., the exposed) is lower than the risk for those captured in the denominator (i.e., the unexposed).  Measures with similar relative interpretations include the odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio, and risk ratio. AR measures consider the number of people who have a particular outcome, the number of people in a population who could have the outcome, and person-time (the period of time during which an individual was at risk of having the outcome). AR measures also reflect the absolute burden of an outcome in a population.  Absolute measures include risks and rates and can be expressed over a specific time frame (e.g., 1 year, 5 years) or overall lifetime. Cumulative risk is a measure of risk that occurs over a defined time period.  For example, overall lifetime risk is a type of cumulative risk that is usually calculated on the basis of a given life expectancy (e.g., 80 or 90 years). Cumulative risk can also be presented over other time frames (e.g., up to age 50 years). Large RR measures do not mean that there will be large effects in the actual number of individuals at a population level because the disease outcome may be quite rare.  For example, the RR for smoking is much higher for lung cancer than for heart disease, but the absolute difference between smokers and nonsmokers is greater for heart disease, the more-common outcome, than for lung cancer, the more-rare outcome. Therefore, in evaluating the effect of exposures and biological markers on disease prevention across the continuum, it is important to recognize the differences between relative and absolute effects in weighing the overall impact of a given risk factor. For example, the magnitude is in the range of 30% (e.g., ORs or RRs of 1.3) for many breast cancer risk factors, which means that women with a risk factor (e.g., alcohol consumption, late age at first birth, oral contraceptive use, postmenopausal body size) have a 30% relative increase in breast cancer in comparison with what they would have if they did not have that risk factor.  But the absolute increase in risk is based on the underlying AR of disease. and show the impact of a RR factor in the range of 1.3 on AR. As shown, women with a family history of breast cancer have a much higher benefit from risk factor reduction on an absolute scale.[ ] With the increasing use of , a framework for cancer risk management among individuals with pathogenic variants detected in novel has been described [ ] that incorporates data on age-specific, lifetime, and absolute cancer risks. The framework suggests initiating screening  in these individuals at the age when their 5-year cancer risk approaches that at which screening is routinely initiated for women in the general population (approximately 1% for breast cancer in the United States). As a result, the age at which to begin screening will vary depending on the gene. (Refer to the section of this summary for more information on multigene panel tests.) Several are found to be associated with the development of breast and/or gynecologic cancers. These genes are categorized as high- , moderate-penetrance, and low-penetrance in this summary. The high- and moderate-penetrance genes are summarized in . Low-penetrance genes and primarily include that have been associated with cancer . (Refer to the , , and sections of this summary for more information.) For more information about and pathogenic variants and -associated cancer risks, see . Lynch syndrome is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance of susceptibility to predominantly right-sided colon cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, and other extracolonic cancers (including cancer of the renal pelvis, ureter, small bowel, and pancreas), multiple primary cancers, and a young age of onset of cancer.[ ]  The condition is caused by germline variants in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, which are involved in repair of DNA mismatch variants.[ ]  The and genes are the most common susceptibility genes for Lynch syndrome, accounting for 80% to 90% of observed pathogenic variants,[ , ] followed by and .[ - ] (Refer to the section in  Genetics of Colorectal Cancer for more information about this syndrome.) After colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer is the second hallmark cancer of a family with Lynch syndrome. Even in the original Family G, described by Dr. Aldred Scott Warthin, numerous family members were noted to have extracolonic cancers including endometrial cancer. Although the first version of the Amsterdam criteria did not include endometrial cancer,[ ] in 1999, the Amsterdam criteria were revised to include endometrial cancer as extracolonic tumors associated with Lynch syndrome to identify families at risk.[ ] In addition, the Bethesda guidelines in 1997 (revised in 2004) did include endometrial and ovarian cancers as Lynch syndrome–related cancers to prompt tumor testing for Lynch syndrome.[ , ] The lifetime risk of ovarian carcinoma in females with Lynch syndrome is estimated to be as high as 12%, and the reported relative risk (RR) of ovarian cancer has ranged from 3.6 to 13, based on families ascertained from high-risk clinics with known or suspected Lynch syndrome.[ - ] There may be differences in ovarian cancer risk depending on the Lynch syndrome–associated pathogenic variant. In -associated Lynch syndrome, one study of 284 families was unable to identify an increased risk of ovarian cancer.[ ] Another prospective registry of 3,119 Lynch syndrome–pathogenic variant carriers described the cumulative risk of ovarian cancer to range from 10% to 17% in , , and carriers. In contrast, 0 of 67 women with a pathogenic variant in developed ovarian cancer in 303 follow-up years.[ ] Overall, there are too few cases of pathogenic variant carriers to make definitive recommendations for ovarian cancer management. Characteristics of Lynch syndrome–associated ovarian cancers may include overrepresentation of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics  stages I and II at diagnosis (reported as 81.5%), underrepresentation of serous subtypes (reported as 22.9%), and a better 10-year survival (reported as 80.6%) than reported both in population-based series and in carriers of pathogenic variants.[ , ] The issue of breast cancer risk in Lynch syndrome has been controversial. Retrospective studies have been inconsistent, but several have demonstrated microsatellite instability in a proportion of breast cancers from individuals with Lynch syndrome;[ - ] one of these studies evaluated breast cancer risk in individuals with Lynch syndrome and found that it is not elevated.[ ] However, the largest prospective study to date of 446 unaffected carriers of pathogenic variants from the Colon Cancer Family Registry [ ] who were followed for up to 10 years reported an elevated SIR of 3.95 for breast cancer (95% CI, 1.59–8.13; = .001).[ ] The same group subsequently analyzed data on 764 carriers of MMR gene pathogenic variants with a prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer.  Results showed that  the 10-year risk of breast cancer following colorectal cancer was 2% (95% CI, 1%–4%) and that the SIR was 1.76 (95% CI, 1.07–2.59).[ ] A series from the United Kingdom composed of clinically referred Lynch syndrome kindreds, with efforts to correct for ascertainment, showed a twofold increased risk of breast cancer in 157 carriers but not in carriers of  other MMR variants.[ ] Results from a meta-analysis of breast cancer risk in Lynch syndrome among 15 studies with molecular tumor testing results revealed that 62 of 122 breast cancers (51%; 95% CI, 42%–60%) in MMR pathogenic variant carriers were MMR-deficient. In addition, breast cancer risk estimates among a total of 21 studies showed an increased risk of twofold to 18-fold in eight studies that compared MMR variant carriers with noncarriers, while 13 studies did not observe statistical evidence for an association of breast cancer risk with Lynch syndrome.[ ] A number of subsequent studies have suggested the presence of higher breast cancer risks than previously published,[ - ] although this has not been consistently observed.[ ] Through a study of 325 Canadian families with Lynch syndrome, primarily encompassing and carriers, the lifetime cumulative risk for breast cancer among carriers was reported to be 22%.[ ]  Similarly, breast cancer risks were elevated in a study of 423 women with Lynch syndrome, with substantially higher risks among those with and pathogenic variants, compared with and pathogenic variants.[ ] In fact, breast cancer risk to age 60 years was 37.7% for , 31.1% for , 16.1% for , and 15.5% for .  These findings are consistent with another study of 528 patients with Lynch syndrome–associated pathogenic variants (including , , , , and ) in which and variants were much more frequent among patients with only breast cancer, compared with those with only colorectal cancer ( = 2.3 x 10 ).[ ]
Additional data to support an association of with breast cancer were provided through a study of over 10,000 cancer patients across the United States who had genetic testing.[ ]  Findings indicated that was associated with breast cancer with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.59 (95% CI, 1.35–5.44). Taken together, these studies highlight how the risk profile among patients with Lynch syndrome is continuing to evolve as more individuals are tested through multigene panel testing, with representation of larger numbers of individuals with and pathogenic variants compared with prior studies.
In the absence of definitive risk estimates, individuals with Lynch syndrome are screened for breast cancer on the basis of family history.[ ] Refer to the section of the section of this summary for information about clinical management of Lynch syndrome. Breast cancer is also a component of the rare LFS, in
which germline variants of the gene on chromosome 17p have been
documented.  Located on chromosome 17p, encodes a 53kd nuclear phosphoprotein that binds
DNA sequences and functions as a negative regulator of cell growth and
proliferation in the setting of DNA damage.  It  is also an
active component of programmed cell death.[ ]  Inactivation of the gene
or disruption of the protein product is thought to allow the persistence of
damaged DNA and the possible development of malignant cells.[ , ] Widely used clinical diagnostic criteria for LFS were originally developed by Chompret et al. in 2001 (called the ) [ ] and revised in 2009 based on additional emerging data.[ ] LFS  is characterized by premenopausal breast cancer
in combination with childhood sarcoma, brain tumors, leukemia, and
adrenocortical carcinoma.[ , , ] Germline variants in are thought to account for fewer than 1% of breast cancer cases.[ ] -associated breast cancer is often human epidermal growth factor receptor two (HER2/neu)–positive, in addition to being estrogen receptor (ER)–positive,  progesterone receptor (PR)–positive, or both.[ - ] Evidence
also exists that patients treated for a -related tumor with chemotherapy or
radiation therapy may be at risk of a treatment-related second malignancy. The term LFS was used for the first time in 1982,[ ] and the following criteria, which subsequently  became the classical definition of the syndrome, were proposed by Li and Fraumeni in 1988 [ ]: Subsequently in 2001, Chompret et al. [ ] systematically developed clinical criteria for recommending genetic testing, with the narrow LFS tumor spectrum defined as sarcoma, brain tumors, breast cancer, and adrenocortical carcinoma.  The criteria were as follows: These criteria were revised in 2009 [ ] based on additional emerging data [ , ] as follows: *The 2009 Chompret criteria defined the LFS tumor spectrum as including the following cancers: soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, brain tumor, premenopausal breast cancer, adrenocortical carcinoma, leukemia, and lung bronchoalveolar cancer. In 2015, Bougeard et al. [ ] revised the criteria based on data from 415 carriers of pathogenic variants, to include the presence of childhood anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancer before age 31 years  as an indication for testing, similar to what is recommended for choroid plexus carcinoma and adrenocortical carcinoma.  The criteria were revised as follows: **The 2015 Chompret criteria defined the LFS tumor spectrum as including the following cancers:  premenopausal breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, central nervous system (CNS) tumor, and adrenocortical carcinoma. Germline pathogenic variants were identified in 17% (n = 91) of 525 samples submitted to City of Hope laboratories for clinical testing.[ ] All families with a pathogenic variant had at least one family member with a sarcoma, breast cancer, brain cancer, or adrenocortical cancer (core cancers). In addition, all eight individuals with a choroid plexus tumor had a pathogenic variant, as did 14 of the 21 individuals with childhood adrenocortical cancer. In women aged 30 to 49 years who had breast cancer but no family history of other core cancers, no variants were found. Subsequently, a large clinical series of patients from France who were tested primarily based on the 2009 version of the Chompret criteria [ ]

 included 415 carriers of pathogenic variants from 214 families.[ ]  In this study, 43% of carriers had multiple malignancies, and the mean age at first tumor onset was 24.9 years.  The childhood tumor spectrum was characterized by osteosarcomas,  adrenocortical carcinomas, CNS tumors, and soft tissue sarcomas (present in 23%–30% collectively), whereas the adult tumor spectrum primarily encompassed breast cancer (79% of females) and soft tissue sarcomas (27% of carriers).  The pathogenic variant detection rate was 6% among females younger than 31 years with breast cancer  and no additional features suggestive of LFS.  Evaluation of genotype-phenotype correlations indicated a gradient of clinical severity, with a significantly lower mean age at onset among those with dominant-negative missense variants (21.3 years), compared with those with all types of loss-of-function variants (28.5 years) or genomic rearrangements (35.8 years).  With the exception of adrenocortical carcinoma, affected children mostly harbored dominant-negative missense pathogenic variants.   Among 127 female carriers of pathogenic variants with breast cancer, 31% developed contralateral breast cancer (CBC).  Receptor status information was available for 40 tumors, which indicated 55% were HER2-positive, and 37% were triple-positive (i.e., ER-positive, PR-positive, and HER2-positive).   There was an exceptionally high rate of multiple malignancies (43%) among carriers of pathogenic variants, of which 83% were metachronous.  Treatment records were available for 64 carriers who received radiation therapy for treatment of their first tumor; of these, 19 (30%) developed 26 secondary tumors within a radiation field, with a latency of 2 to 26 years (mean, 10.7 y). Similarly, results of 286 pathogenic variant–positive individuals in the National Cancer Institute’s LFS Study indicated a cumulative cancer incidence of almost 100% by age 70 years for both males and females.[ ] They reported substantial variations by sex, age, and cancer type.  Specifically, cumulative cancer incidence reached 50% by age 31 years in females and age 46 years in males, although male risks were higher in childhood and late adulthood.  Cumulative cancer incidence by sex for the top four cancers is included in .  Of those with one cancer, 49% developed at least one additional cancer after a median of 10 years.  Age-specific risks for developing first and second cancers were comparable. With the increasing use of , it is important to recognize that pathogenic variants in are unexpectedly being identified in individuals without a family history characteristic of LFS.[ ] The clinical significance of finding an isolated pathogenic variant in an individual or family who does not meet the Chompret criteria is uncertain. Consequently, it remains important to interpret cancer risks and determine optimal management strategies for individuals who are unexpectedly found to have a germline pathogenic variant, while considering their personal and family histories. One cohort study evaluated 116 individuals with a germline pathogenic variant yearly at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center using multimodality screening with and without gadolinium. Baseline screening identified a cancer in eight patients (6.9%) with a false-positive rate of 34.5% for MRI (n = 40).[ ] Breast cancer screening  with annual breast MRI with and without contrast is recommended.[ ] Additional screening for other cancers has been studied and is evolving.[ , ] Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS) are part of a spectrum of conditions known collectively as hamartoma tumor syndromes (PHTS). Approximately 85% of patients diagnosed with Cowden syndrome, and  approximately 60% of patients with BRRS have an identifiable pathogenic variant.[ ] In addition, pathogenic variants have been identified in patients with very diverse clinical phenotypes.[ ] The term PHTS refers to any patient with a pathogenic variant, irrespective of clinical presentation. functions as a dual-specificity phosphatase that removes phosphate groups from tyrosine, serine, and threonine. pathogenic variants are diverse and can present as , missense, , or . Approximately 40% of variants are found in exon 5, which encodes the phosphatase core motif; several recurrent pathogenic variants have been observed at this location.[ ] Pathogenic variants in the 5’ end of or within the phosphatase core of tend to affect more organ systems.[ ] Operational criteria for the diagnosis of Cowden syndrome have been published and subsequently updated.[ , ] These include major,  minor, and criteria that consist of certain mucocutaneous manifestations and adult-onset dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum (Lhermitte-Duclos disease).   An updated set of criteria based on a systematic literature review has been suggested  [ ]   and is currently utilized in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.[ ] Contrary to previous criteria, the authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence for any features to be classified as pathognomonic. Increased genetic testing (especially ) has identified individuals with germline pathogenic variants who do not meet  diagnostic criteria for PHTS. Diagnostic criteria will need to be reconciled with these recently discovered phenotypes. Hence, it is unclear whether PHTS diagnoses should be based on clinical features or a positive genetic test result. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) suggests that referral for genetics consultation be considered for individuals with a personal history of or a first-degree relative with the following: 1) adult-onset Lhermitte-Duclos disease or 2) any three of the major or minor criteria that have been established for the diagnosis of Cowden syndrome.[ ] Detailed recommendations, including for Cowden syndrome, can be found in the NCCN and ACMG guidelines.[ , ] Additionally, a predictive that uses clinical criteria to estimate the probability of a pathogenic variant is available; a cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that germline testing is cost effective if the probability of a variant is greater than 10%.[ ] Over a 10-year period, the International Cowden Consortium (ICC)  prospectively recruited a consecutive series of adult and pediatric patients meeting relaxed ICC criteria for testing in  the United States, Europe, and Asia.[ ] Most individuals did not meet the clinical criteria for a diagnosis of Cowden syndrome or BRRS. Of the 3,399 individuals recruited and tested, 295 probands (8.8%) and an additional 73 family members carried a germline pathogenic variant.  The authors concluded that melanoma, kidney cancer, and colorectal cancer should be added to the spectrum of cancers associated with germline pathogenic variants (in addition to breast cancer, thyroid cancer, and endometrial cancer). This conclusion was based on the high melanoma, kidney, and colorectal cancer lifetime risk estimates found in individuals with pathogenic variants. A second study of approximately 100 patients with a germline pathogenic variant confirmed these findings and suggested a cumulative cancer risk of 85% by age 70 years.[ ] Although pathogenic variants, which are estimated to occur in 1 in 200,000 individuals,[ ] account for a small fraction of hereditary
breast cancer, the characterization of PTEN function will provide valuable
insights into the signal pathway and the maintenance of normal cell
physiology.[ , ]  Lifetime breast cancer risk is estimated to be between 25% and 50% among women with Cowden syndrome.[ ] Other studies have reported risks as high as 85%;[ , , , ] however, there are concerns regarding selection bias in these studies. As in
other forms of hereditary breast cancer, onset is often at a young age and may
be bilateral.[ ]  Lifetime risk of endometrial cancer is estimated to be between 19% and 28%, depending on the cohort studied, with an increased risk of premenopausal onset.[ , , ] Because of the low prevalence of pathogenic variants in the population, the proportion of endometrial cancer attributable to Cowden syndrome is small. There are no data that link pathogenic variants to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Skin manifestations include multiple trichilemmomas, oral
fibromas and papillomas, and acral, palmar, and plantar keratoses.  History or
observation of the characteristic skin features raises a suspicion of Cowden
syndrome.  CNS manifestations include macrocephaly, developmental delay, and dysplastic gangliocytomas of the cerebellum.[ , ]    (Refer to the PDQ summaries on and for more information about hamartoma tumor syndromes [including Cowden syndrome].) For more information about HDGC, see the following: PJS is an early-onset autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by melanocytic macules on the lips, the perioral region, and buccal region;
and multiple gastrointestinal polyps, both hamartomatous and
adenomatous.[ - ]  Germline pathogenic variants in the gene at chromosome 19p13.3 have been identified in the vast majority of PJS families.[ - ]  The most common cancers in PJS are gastrointestinal. However, other organs are at increased risk of developing malignancies.  For example, the cumulative risks have been estimated to be 32% to 54% for breast cancer [ - ] and 21% for ovarian cancer (mainly ovarian sex-cord tumors).[ ] The risk for pancreatic cancer has been estimated to be more than 100-fold higher than that in the general population.[ ] A systematic review found a lifetime cumulative cancer risk, all sites combined, of up to 93% in patients with PJS.[ , ] shows the cumulative risk of these tumors. Females with PJS are also predisposed to the development of cervical adenoma malignum, a rare and very aggressive adenocarcinoma of the cervix.[ ] In addition, females with PJS commonly develop benign ovarian sex-cord tumors with annular tubules, whereas males with PJS are predisposed to development of Sertoli-cell testicular tumors;[ ] although neither of these two tumor types is malignant, they can cause symptoms related to increased estrogen production. Although the risk of malignancy appears to be exceedingly high in individuals with PJS based on the published literature, the possibility that selection and referral biases have resulted in overestimates of these risks should be considered. PJS is caused by pathogenic variants in the (also called ) tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 19p13.[ , ]  Unlike the adenomas seen in familial adenomatous polyposis, the polyps arising in PJS are hamartomas. Studies of the hamartomatous polyps and cancers of PJS show allelic imbalance (LOH) consistent with the two-hit hypothesis, demonstrating that is a tumor suppressor gene.[ , ] However, heterozygous knockout mice develop hamartomas without inactivation of the remaining wild-type allele, suggesting that may be sufficient for initial tumor development in PJS.[ ] Subsequently, the cancers that develop in +/- mice do show LOH;[ ] indeed, compound mutant mice heterozygous for pathogenic variants in +/- and homozygous for pathogenic variants in -/- have accelerated development of both hamartomas and cancers.[ ] Germline variants of the gene represent a spectrum of nonsense, frameshift, and missense variants, and splice-site variants and large deletions.[ , ] Approximately 85% of variants are localized to regions of the kinase domain of the expressed protein. No strong genotype-phenotype correlations have been identified.[ ] Up to 30% of variants are large deletions involving one or more exons of , underscoring the importance of deletion analysis in suspected cases of PJS.[ ] has been unequivocally demonstrated to cause PJS. Although earlier estimates using direct DNA sequencing showed a 50% pathogenic variant detection rate in , studies adding techniques to detect large deletions have found pathogenic variants in up to 94% of individuals meeting clinical criteria for PJS.[ , , ] Given the results of these studies, it is unlikely that other major genes cause PJS. The high cumulative risk of cancers in PJS has led to the various screening recommendations summarized in the table of in the PDQ summary on . PALB2 (partner and localizer of BRCA2) interacts with the BRCA2 protein and plays a role in homologous recombination and double-stranded DNA repair. Similar to and , pathogenic variants in have also been shown to cause Fanconi anemia.[ ] pathogenic variants have been screened for in multiple small studies of familial and early-onset breast cancer in multiple populations.[ - ] Pathogenic variant prevalence has ranged from 0.4% to 3.9%.  Similar to and , there was incomplete segregation of pathogenic variants in families with hereditary breast cancer.[ ] Among 559 cases with CBC and 565 matched controls with unilateral breast cancer, pathogenic (truncating) pathogenic variants were identified in 0.9% of cases and in none of the controls (RR, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.8–13.2).[ ] Data based on 154 families with loss-of-function variants suggest that this gene may be an important cause of hereditary breast cancer, with risks that overlap with .[ ]  In this study, analysis of 362 family members from 154 families with pathogenic variants indicated that the AR of female breast cancer by age 70 years ranged from 33% (95% CI, 24%–44%) for those with no family history of breast cancer to 58% (95% CI, 50%–66%) for those with two or more FDRs with early-onset breast cancer.  Furthermore, among 63 breast cancer cases in which HER2 status was known, 30% had triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).  An earlier  Finnish study reported on a founder pathogenic variant (c.1592delT) that confers a 40% risk of breast cancer to age 70 years [ ] and  is associated with a high incidence (54%) of TNBC and lower survival.[ ] Pathogenic variants have been observed in early-onset and familial breast cancer in many populations.[ , ] A large report of 1,824 patients with TNBC unselected for family history, recruited through 12 studies, identified 1.2% with a pathogenic variant.[ ] (Refer to the section in and : Cancer Risks and Management for more information about this study.) In a later Polish study of more than 12,529 unselected women with breast cancer and 4,702 controls, pathogenic variants were detected in 116 cases (0.93%; 95% CI, 0.76%–1.09%) and 10 controls (0.21%; 95% CI, 0.08%–0.34%), with an OR for breast cancer of 4.39 (95% CI, 2.30–8.37).[ ]  The study findings confirm a substantially elevated risk of breast cancer (24%–40%) among women with a pathogenic variant up to age 75 years.  The 5-year cumulative incidence of CBC was 10% among those with a pathogenic variant, compared with 17% among those with a pathogenic variant and 3% among those without a variant in either gene.  Furthermore, the 10-year survival for women with a pathogenic variant and breast cancer was 48% (95% CI, 36.5%–63.2%), compared with 72.0% among those with a pathogenic variant and 74.7% among those without a variant in either gene. Among carriers, breast tumors 2 cm or larger had substantially worse outcomes (32.4% 10-year survival), compared with tumors smaller than 2 cm (82.4% 10-year survival).  Approximately one-third of those with a pathogenic variant had TNBC, and the average age at breast cancer diagnosis was 53.3 years. A similar case-control study from China enrolled 16,501 unselected patients with breast cancer and 5,890 controls. These patients were screened for , , and pathogenic variants. The prevalence of pathogenic variants was 0.97% in the cases and 0.19% in the controls.  The OR for breast cancer for carriers was 5.23 (95% CI, 2.84–9.65; > .0001). carriers were more likely to be age 30 years or younger (6.88% vs. 3.56%; = .04). carriers were also more likely  to have TNBCs (22.83% vs. 13.56%; = .004), larger tumors (tumor size ≥2 cm, 55.93% vs. 45.93%; = .04), node-positive tumors (49.60% vs. 38.80%; = .018), and CBCs (6.29% vs. 2.01%; = .003). Additionally, carriers were more likely to have a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancers (20.63% vs. 7.96%; < .0001).[ ] In the largest study to date, 524 families with pathogenic variants in recruited through an international effort, the RR of breast cancer in women was reported to be 7.18 (95% CI, 5.82–8.85), with a 53% risk (95% CI, 44%–63%) of breast cancer to age 80 years.[ ] Additional elevated risks reported included ovarian cancer (RR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.40–6.04) with a lifetime risk of 5% (95% CI, 2%–10%), pancreatic cancer (RR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.24–4.50) with a lifetime risk of 2% to 3% (95% CI for women, 1%–4%; 95% CI for men, 2%–5%), and male breast cancer (RR, 7.34; 95% CI, 1.28–42.18) with a lifetime risk of 1% (95% CI, 0.2%–5%). These findings confirm the role of as an inherited breast cancer gene in women, while firmly establishing an association with ovarian, pancreatic, and male breast cancers. Male breast cancer has been observed in pathogenic variant–positive breast cancer families.[ , , ] In a study of 115 male breast cancer cases in which 18 men had pathogenic variants, an additional two men had either a pathogenic or predicted pathogenic variant (accounting for about 10% of germline variants in the study and 1%–2% of the total sample).[ ]  The RR of breast cancer for male carriers of pathogenic variants compared with that seen in the general population was estimated to be 8.30 (95% CI, 0.77–88.56; = .08) in the study of 154 families.[ ] After the identification of pathogenic variants in pancreatic tumors and the detection of germline pathogenic variants in 3% of 96 familial pancreatic patients,[ ] numerous studies have pointed to a role for in pancreatic cancer. pathogenic variants were detected in 3.7% of 81 familial pancreatic cancer families [ ] and in 2.1% of 94 pathogenic variant–negative breast cancer patients who had either a personal or family history of pancreatic cancer.[ ]  Two relatively small studies—one of 77 pathogenic variant–negative probands with a personal or family 
history of pancreatic cancer, one-half of whom were of AJ descent, and another study of 29 Italian pancreatic cancer patients with a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer—failed to detect any pathogenic variants.[ , ] A sixfold increase in pancreatic cancer was observed in the relatives of 33 -negative, pathogenic variant–positive breast cancer probands.[ ] Overall, the observed prevalence of pathogenic variants in familial breast cancer varied depending on ascertainment relative to personal and family history of pancreatic and ovarian cancers, but in 
all studies, the observed pathogenic variant rate was lower than 4%. Data suggest that the RR of breast cancer may overlap with that of , particularly in those with a strong family history; thus, it remains important to refine cancer risk estimates in larger studies. Furthermore, the risk of other cancers (e.g., pancreatic) is poorly defined. Given the low pathogenic variant prevalence in the population, additional data are needed to define best candidates for testing and appropriate management. Until the 1990s, the diagnosis of genetically inherited breast and ovarian cancer syndromes was based on clinical manifestations and family history. Now that some of the genes involved in these syndromes have been identified, a few studies have attempted to estimate the spontaneous pathogenic variant rate ( rate) in these populations. Interestingly, PJS, hamartoma syndromes, and LFS are all thought to have high rates of spontaneous pathogenic variants, in the 10% to 30% range,[ - ] while estimates of de novo pathogenic variants in the genes are thought to be low, primarily on the basis of the few case reports published.[ - ] Additionally, there has been only one case series of breast cancer patients who were tested for pathogenic variants in which a de novo variant was identified.  Specifically, in this study of 193 patients with sporadic breast cancer, 17 pathogenic variants were detected, one of which was confirmed to be a de novo pathogenic variant.[ ]  As such, the de novo pathogenic variant rate appears to be low and fall into the 5% or less range, based on  the limited studies performed.[ - ] Similarly, estimates of de novo pathogenic variants in the MMR genes associated with Lynch syndrome are thought to be low, in the 0.9% to 5% range.[ - ] However, these estimates of spontaneous pathogenic variant rates in the genes and Lynch syndrome genes seem to overlap with the estimates of nonpaternity rates in various populations (0.6%–3.3%),[ - ] making the de novo pathogenic variant rate for these genes relatively low. in , , , and the involved in other rare syndromes discussed in the section of this summary account for less than 25% of the risk of breast cancer.[ ] Despite intensive genetic , there do not appear to be other high- genes that account for a significant fraction of the remaining multiple-case familial clusters.[ ]  However, several moderate-penetrance genes associated with breast and/or gynecologic cancers have been identified. Genes such as and are associated with a 20% or higher lifetime risk of breast cancer;[ , ] similarly, genes such as , , and are associated with a 5% to 10% risk of ovarian cancer.[ , ] Many of these genes are now included on , although the clinical actionability of these findings remains uncertain and under  investigation. There is a very large literature of genetic epidemiology studies describing associations between various and breast cancer risk. Many of these studies suffer from significant design limitations. Perhaps as a consequence, most reported associations do not replicate in follow-up studies. This section is not a comprehensive review of all reported associations. This section describes associations that are believed by the editors to be clinically valid, in that they have been described in several studies or are supported by robust meta-analyses. The clinical utility of these observations remains unclear, however, as the risks associated with these variations usually fall below a threshold that would justify a clinical response. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare, inherited condition characterized by bone marrow failure, increased risk of malignancy, and physical abnormalities. To date, 16 FA-related genes, including , have been identified (as outlined in ). FA  is mainly an condition, except when caused by pathogenic variants in , which is . accounts for 60% to 70% of pathogenic variants, accounts for approximately 14%, and the remaining genes each account for 3% or fewer.[ ] Progressive bone marrow failure typically occurs in the first decade, with patients often presenting with thrombocytopenia or leucopenia.  The incidence of bone marrow failure is 90% by age 40 to 50 years.  The incidence is 10% to 30% for hematologic malignancies (primarily acute myeloid leukemia) and 25% to 30% for nonhematologic malignancies (solid tumors, particularly of the head and neck, skin, gastrointestinal [GI] tract, and genital tract).  Physical abnormalities,  including short stature, abnormal skin pigmentation, radial ray defects (including malformation of the thumbs), abnormalities of the urinary tract, eyes, ears, heart, GI system, and central nervous system, hypogonadism, and developmental delay are present in 60% to 75% of affected individuals.[ ] Variants in some of the FA genes, most notably and , but also , , and , among others, may predispose to breast cancer in heterozygotes.  Given the widespread availability of , genetic testing of many of the FA genes is frequently performed despite uncertain cancer risks and the lack of available evidence-based medical management recommendations for many of these genes. FA gene pathogenic variant carrier status can have implications for reproductive decision making because pathogenic variants in these genes can lead to serious childhood onset of disease if both parents are carriers of pathogenic variants in the same gene. Partner testing may be considered. (also known as ) encodes a helicase that interacts with the C-terminal  domain. This gene also has a role in BRCA1-dependent DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint function. pathogenic variants in are a cause of FA,[ - ] much like such pathogenic variants in . Monoallelic pathogenic variants in have emerged as having a significant association with increased ovarian cancer risk. Nine-tenths to two and half percent of women with ovarian cancer carry a pathogenic variant in .[ ] Odds ratios (ORs) for ovarian cancer in individuals with a pathogenic variant range from 2.2 to 5.0.[ ] The median age of ovarian cancer diagnosis in individuals with pathogenic variants ranges from the mid-50s to 70 years. pathogenic variants have been seen in high-grade serous, borderline, and endometrioid ovarian cancers, but not in clear-cell or mucinous types.[ ] Per current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended for women who carry a pathogenic variant.[ ] With respect to breast cancer risk, several studies consistently report ORs less than 2.0. A meta-analysis of 148 studies found an OR for breast cancer of 1.62 in individuals with pathogenic variants (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20–2.20).[ ] ORs for breast cancer in carriers  ranged from 0.60 to 1.81 in other studies. There is a growing consensus that is not a moderate- to high-risk breast cancer susceptibility gene.  However, studies are looking at the possible associations between pathogenic variants  and certain subtypes of breast cancer, such as triple-negative breast cancer. Limitations of these association studies  include the following: rarity of pathogenic variants, heterogeneity of study methodologies, and inconsistent reporting of family histories in many of the published studies. is a gene involved in the damage repair response pathway. Based on numerous studies, a , 1100delC, appears to be a rare, moderate-penetrance cancer susceptibility allele.[ - ]  One study identified the pathogenic variant in 1.2% of the European controls, 4.2% of the European -negative familial breast cancer cases, and 1.4% of unselected female breast cancer cases.[ ] In a group of 1,479 Dutch women younger than 50 years with invasive breast cancer,  3.7% were found to have the 1100delC pathogenic variant.[ ] In additional European and U.S.  (where the pathogenic variant appears to be slightly less common) studies, including a large prospective study,[ ]  the frequency of pathogenic variants detected in familial breast or ovarian cancer cases has ranged from 0% [ ] to 11%;  overall, these studies have found an approximately 1.5-fold to 3-fold increased risk of female breast cancer.[ , - ]  A multicenter combined analysis and reanalysis of nearly 20,000 subjects from ten case-control studies, however, has verified a significant 2.3-fold excess of breast cancer among carriers of pathogenic variants.[ ]    A subsequent meta-analysis based on 29,154 cases and 37,064 controls from 25 case-control studies found a significant association between 1100delC heterozygotes and breast cancer risk (OR, 2.75; 95% CI, 2.25–3.36).  The ORs and CIs in unselected, familial, and early-onset breast cancer subgroups were 2.33 (1.79–3.05), 3.72 (2.61–5.31), and 2.78 (2.28–3.39), respectively. However, study limitations included pooling of populations without subgroup analysis, using  a mix of population-based and hospital-based controls, and basing results on unadjusted estimates (as cases and controls were matched on only a few common factors); therefore, results should be interpreted in the context of these limitations.[ ] In a series of male breast cancer patients, the 1100delC variant was significantly more frequently identified than in controls, suggesting that this variant is also associated with an increased risk of male breast cancer.[ ] Two studies have suggested that the risk associated with a 1100delC pathogenic variant was stronger in the families of ascertained because of bilateral breast cancer.[ , ] Furthermore, a meta-analysis of carriers of 1100delC pathogenic variants estimated the risk of breast cancer to be 42% by age 70 years in women with a family history of breast cancer.[ ]  Similarly, a Polish study reported that truncating pathogenic variants confer breast cancer risks based on a family history of breast cancer as follows: no family history, 20%; one (SDR), 28%; one (FDR), 34%; and both FDRs and SDRs, 44%.[ ]  Moreover, a Dutch study suggested that female homozygotes for the 1100delC variant have a greater-than-twofold increased breast cancer risk compared with heterozygotes.[ ] Although there have been conflicting reports regarding cancers other than breast cancer associated with pathogenic variants, this may be dependent on variant type (i.e., vs. truncating) or population studied and is not currently of clinical utility.[ , , - ] The contribution of variants to breast cancer may depend on the population studied, with a potentially higher variant prevalence in Poland.[ ] Carriers of variants in Poland may be more susceptible to estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer.[ ] A large Dutch study of 86,975 individuals reported an increased risk of cancers other than breast and colon for carriers of the 1100delC pathogenic variant,[ ] although additional studies are needed to further refine these risks. (Refer to the section in Genetics of Colorectal Cancer   for more information.) Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by
neurologic deterioration, telangiectasias, immunodeficiency states, and
hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation.  It is estimated that 1%
of the general population may be heterozygote carriers of variants.[ ]  More than 300 variants in the gene have been
identified, most of which are truncating
variants.[ ] ATM proteins have been shown to play a role in cell cycle
control.[ - ] , AT-deficient cells are sensitive to ionizing radiation and
radiomimetic drugs, and lack cell cycle regulatory properties after exposure to
radiation.[ ] There is insufficient evidence to recommend against radiation therapy in carriers of a single pathogenic variant (heterozygotes). Initial, large epidemiological studies demonstrated a statistically increased relative risk (RR) of approximately 2.0 for breast cancer among female heterozygotes.[ , ] 
 Subsequent, large international consortium-based studies have refined risk estimates.[ , ] An international study based on 113,000 females from 25 countries reported an OR  of 2.10 (95% CI, 1.71–2.57) for breast cancer in heterozygotes. pathogenic variants were also associated  with ER-positive tumors.[ ] Domains specifically associated with higher breast cancer risks included the FRAP–ATM–TRRAP (FAT) domain ( = .00019 in all studies) and protein kinase domains ( = .00092 in all studies). Similarly, a United States–based study of 63,000 women reported an OR of 1.82 for breast cancer in heterozygotes (95% CI, 1.46–2.27) and also reported an association between pathogenic variants and ER-positive breast cancers.[ ] A similar OR of 2.03 (95% CI, 1.89–2.19) was estimated for invasive ductal breast cancer through a commercial, lab-based study of 4,607 individuals with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants.[ ] Age-specific cumulative breast cancer risks modeled through a meta-analysis were reported to be 6.02% by age 50 years and 32.83% by age 80 years.[ ] Another meta-analysis reported the RR for female breast cancer as 3.0 in carriers (95% CI, 2.1–4.5).[ ] A subsequent systematic review and meta-analysis  estimated an adjusted OR of 1.67 for breast cancer risk in individuals with pathogenic variants (95% CI, 0.73–3.82) based on seven adjusted case-control studies.[ ] The crude OR was 2.27 (95% CI, 1.17–4.40) based on nine unadjusted case-control studies. The RR was estimated as 1.68 (95% CI, 1.17–2.40) based on two cohort studies. Overall, the findings suggested genotype-phenotype correlations, with the c.7271T>G variant (also known as the Val2424Gly variant) as the most predisposing factor and with limited predictive ability for Asp1853Val, Leu546Val, and Ser707Pro variants. Per NCCN guidelines, it is recommended that women who carry an pathogenic variant have annual mammograms starting at age 40 years with consideration of breast magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast beginning at age 30 to 35 years.[ ] While multiple studies have reported that  most pathogenic variants impart moderate risks for breast cancer, the c.7271T>G missense variant has been shown to predispose individuals to higher breast cancer risks.[ , ] Specifically, in a commercial laboratory, data-based study of patients referred for hereditary cancer testing with a multi-gene panel (N = 627,742) including 4,607 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant carriers, risk of invasive ductal breast cancer was higher for the c.7271T>G  missense variant (OR, 3.76; 95% CI, 2.76–5.12) than for other missense and truncating variants.[ ] Some studies reported an association between and ovarian cancer, with ovarian cancer lifetime risk approaching  ~3%.[ , ]  A commercial laboratory, data-based study reported an OR of 1.57 (95% CI, 1.35–1.83) for ovarian cancer in pathogenic variant carriers.[ ] Pancreatic cancer has also been associated with pathogenic variants, with an OR of 4.21 (95% CI, 3.24–5.47) reported through a commercial lab–based study.[ ] Among 130 pancreatic cancer kindreds with a germline pathogenic variant, the cumulative risk of pancreatic cancer was 1.1% (95% CI, 0.8%–1.3%) by age 50 years, 6.3% (95% CI, 3.9%–8.7%) by age 70 years, and 9.5% (95% CI, 5.0%–14.0%) by age 80 years.[ ] Overall, the RR of pancreatic cancer was 6.5 (95% CI, 4.5–9.5) in pathogenic variant carriers when compared with noncarriers. The average  age at diagnosis was 64 years (range, 31–98 y). The association between pathogenic variants  and prostate cancer risk have been inconclusive, with a commercial lab–based study reporting an OR of 2.58 (95% CI, 1.93–3.44).[ ] For more information, see the section in Genetics of Prostate Cancer. and the family of -related genes, also known as paralogs, are thought to encode proteins that are involved in DNA damage repair through homologous recombination and interaction with numerous other DNA repair proteins, including BRCA1 and BRCA2.  The RAD51 protein plays a central role in single-strand annealing in the DNA damage response. RAD51 recruitment to break sites and recombinational DNA repair depend on the paralogs, although their precise cellular functions are poorly characterized.[ ]   Variants in these genes are thought to result in loss of RAD51 focus formation in response to DNA damage.[ ] One of five -related genes, has been reported to be linked to both FA-like disorders and familial breast and ovarian cancers. The literature, however, has produced contradictory findings. In a study of 480 German families characterized by breast and ovarian cancers who were negative for and pathogenic variants, six monoallelic variants in were found (frequency of 1.3%).[ ] Another study screened 286 -negative patients with breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer and found one likely pathogenic variant in -G153D.[ ] pathogenic variants have also been reported in Australian, British, Finnish, and Spanish non- ovarian cancer–only and breast/ovarian cancer families, and in unselected ovarian cancer cases, with frequencies ranging from 0% to 3% in these populations.[ , - ] In a sample of 206 high-risk Jewish women (including 79 of origin) previously tested for the common Jewish pathogenic variants, two previously described and possibly pathogenic missense variants were detected.[ ]    Four additional studies were unable to confirm an association between the gene and hereditary breast cancer or ovarian cancer.[ - ] In addition to carriers of pathogenic variants, there are  other paralogs, including , , , , and , that may be associated with breast and/or ovarian cancer risk,[ , , - ] although the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. In a case-control study of 3,429 ovarian cancer patients, and pathogenic variants were more commonly found in ovarian cancer cases (0.82%) than in controls (0.11%, < .001).[ ] In addition to , different polymorphisms of have been hypothesized to have reduced capacity to repair DNA defects, resulting in increased susceptibility to familial breast cancer.  The Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of (CIMBA) pooled data from 8,512 carriers of and pathogenic variants and found evidence of an increased risk of breast cancer among  women who were carriers and who were homozygous for CC at the 135G→C SNV (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.91–1.51).[ ] Several meta-analyses have investigated the association between the 135G→C polymorphism and breast cancer risk. There is significant overlap in the studies reported in these meta-analyses,  significant variability in the characteristics of the populations included, and significant methodologic limitations to their findings.[ - ] A meta-analysis of nine epidemiologic studies involving 13,241 cases and 13,203 controls of unknown / status found that women carrying the CC had an increased risk of breast cancer compared with women with the GG or GC genotype (OR,  1.35; 95% CI, 1.04–1.74).  A meta-analysis of 14 case-control studies involving 12,183 cases and 10,183 controls confirmed an increased risk only for women who were known carriers (OR,  4.92; 95% CI, 1.10–21.83).[ ]   Another meta-analysis of 12 studies included only studies of known -negative cases and found no association between 135G→C and breast cancer.[ ] In summary, among this conflicting data is substantial evidence for a modest association between germline variants in and breast cancer and ovarian cancer.  There is also evidence of an association between polymorphisms in 135G→C among women with homozygous CC genotypes and breast cancer, particularly among carriers.  These associations are plausible given the known role of in the maintenance of genomic stability. encodes BRG1 and is a catalytic subunit of the  SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a major role in rendering chromatin accessible to regulation of gene expression. Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare, aggressive tumor that has an early age at onset (before age 40 y) and a poor prognosis.[ - ]

 Familial clustering is sometimes present. SCCOHT tumors may be unilateral or bilateral and have been characterized histologically by the presence of small hyperchromatic cells with brisk mitotic activity.[ ]
 A multimodality approach including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy has been suggested for the treatment of SCCOHT.[ , ] Given the paraneoplastic phenomenon of hypercalcemia in 60% of cases, tracking calcium levels is useful in monitoring the course of disease.  With a wide range of differential diagnoses including germ cell tumors, sex cord–stromal tumors, and undifferentiated carcinomas, SCCOHT remains classified by the World Health Organization as a "miscellaneous tumor" but more recently has been sequenced to be a malignant rhabdoid tumor.[ ] Through exome sequencing, most cases of SCCOHT have been found to lack functional /BRG1; in fact, pathogenic variants in may be the sole variants responsible for SCCOHT. Despite only approximately 300 cases in the literature, three separate research groups showed SCCOHT to be associated with germline and in the gene. In one study of 12 young women with SCCOHT, sequencing of paired tumor and normal samples identified inactivating biallelic pathogenic variants in each case.[ ]
Only four additional nonrecurrent somatic genes were identified in any of the other 278 genes sequenced. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated loss of SMARCA4 protein expression in seven of nine tested cases, consistent with a function. In a second study of another 12 patients, also  identified as the only recurrently variant gene, with the majority of variants predicted to result in a truncated protein.[ ] A third study included three families in whom whole-exome sequencing with confirmation identified at least one germline pathogenic variant or somatic mutation in 24 of 26 cases.[ ] Overall, 38 of 43 (88%) of SCCOHT tumors showed loss of SMARCA4 expression, in comparison to only 1 of 139 (0.7%) other ovarian tumor types. Because of the rarity of this tumor, the penetrance of is unknown. There is currently no consensus for management,  yet is on the larger multigene panels currently available for genetic testing, and risk-reducing surgery has been offered to pathogenic variant carriers.[ ] underlying polygenic susceptibility to breast and gynecologic cancers are considered low , a term often applied to sequence associated with a minimal to moderate risk. This is in contrast to variants or that are typically associated with more severe , for example pathogenic variants leading to an pattern in a family, and variants such as , , and . (Refer to the and the sections of this summary for more information.) Because these types of sequence variants (also called low-penetrance , alleles, variants, and polymorphisms) are relatively common in the general population, their overall contribution to cancer risk is estimated to be much greater than the in the population from pathogenic variants in and . For example, it is estimated by that half of all breast cancer occurs in 12% of the population that is deemed most susceptible.[ ] There are no known low-penetrance variants in . The N372H variation in , initially thought to be a low-penetrance allele, was not verified in a large combined analysis.[ ] Two strategies have attempted to identify low-penetrance polymorphisms leading to breast cancer susceptibility: candidate gene and . Both involve the epidemiologic case-control study design. The candidate gene approach involves selecting genes based on their known or presumed biological function, relevance to carcinogenesis or organ physiology, and then searching for or testing known genetic variants for an association with cancer risk. This strategy relies on imperfect and incomplete biological knowledge, and, despite some confirmed associations (described below), has been relatively disappointing.[ , ] The candidate gene approach has largely been replaced by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in which a very large number of (SNVs) (approximately 1 million to 5 million) are chosen within the genome and tested, mostly without regard to their possible biological function, but instead to more uniformly capture all genetic variation throughout the genome. In contrast to assessing candidate genes and/or alleles, GWAS involve comparing a very large set of genetic variants spread throughout the genome.  The current paradigm uses sets of as many as 5 million SNVs that are chosen to capture a large portion of common variation within the genome based on the HapMap and the 1000 Genomes Project.[ , ]  By comparing allele frequencies between a large number of cases and controls, typically 1,000 or more of each, and validating promising signals in replication sets of subjects, very robust statistical signals of association have been obtained.[ - ] The strong correlation between many SNVs that are physically close to each other on the ( ) allows one to “scan” the genome for susceptibility alleles even if the biologically relevant variant is not within the tested set of SNVs.  Although this between-SNV correlation allows one to interrogate the majority of the genome without having to assay every SNV, when a validated association is obtained, it is not usually obvious which of the many correlated variants is causal. Genome-wide searches are showing great promise in identifying common, low-penetrance susceptibility alleles for many complex diseases,[ ]  including breast cancer.[ - ] The first study involved an initial scan in breast cancer cases followed by replication in two large sample sets of , the final being a  collection of over 20,000 cases and 20,000 controls from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC).[ ] Five distinct genomic regions were identified that were within or near the , , , and genes or at the chromosome 8q region.  The 8q region and others may harbor multiple independent associated with risk.   Subsequent genome-wide studies have replicated these loci and identified additional ones.[ , , - ] Numerous SNVs identified through large studies of sporadic breast cancer appear to be associated more strongly with estrogen receptor (ER)–positive disease;[ ] however, some are associated primarily or exclusively with other subtypes, including .[ , ] An is available of SNV-trait associations
from published GWAS for use in investigating
genomic characteristics of trait/disease-associated SNVs. Although the statistical evidence for an association between genetic variation at these loci and breast and ovarian cancer risk is overwhelming, the biologically relevant variants and 
the mechanism by which they lead to increased risk are unknown and will require further genetic and functional characterization.  Additionally, these loci are associated with very modest risk (typically, an odds  ratio [OR] <1.5), with more risk variants likely to be identified.  No interaction between the SNVs and epidemiologic risk factors for breast cancer have been identified.[ , ] Furthermore, theoretical models have suggested that common moderate-risk SNVs have limited potential to improve models for individualized .[ - ]  These models used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) as a measure of discriminatory accuracy. A subsequent study used ROC curve analysis to examine the utility of SNVs in a clinical dataset of more than 5,500 breast cancer cases and nearly 6,000 controls, using a model with traditional risk factors compared with a model using both standard risk factors and ten previously identified SNVs. The addition of genetic information modestly changed the AUC from 58% to 61.8%, a result that was not felt to be clinically significant. Despite this, 32.5% of patients were in a higher quintile of breast cancer risk when genetic information was included, and 20.4% were in a lower quintile of risk. Whether such information has clinical utility is unclear.[ , ] More limited data are available regarding ovarian cancer risk. Three GWAS involving staged analysis of more than 10,000 cases and 13,000 controls have been carried out for ovarian cancer.[ - ]    As in other GWAS, the ORs are modest, generally about 1.2 or weaker but implicate a number of genes with plausible biological ties to ovarian cancer, such as , whose protein complexes with and may regulate BRCA1, and , which codes for a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, molecules that may be important in -deficient cells. The collective influence of many genetic variants has more recently been evaluated using an aggregate score.  In 2015, a (PRS) comprising all of the known breast cancer risk genetic variants or SNVs was estimated in women of European ancestry using 41 studies in the BCAC, including more than 33,000 breast cancer cases and 33,000 controls.[ ]  This early attempt at estimating a PRS for breast cancer included 77 SNVs, which collectively conferred lifetime risks of developing breast cancer by age 80 years of 3.5% and 29% for women in the lowest and highest 1% of the PRS, respectively.[ ] Since then, PRSs incorporating additional genetic variants and examining other breast cancer–related outcomes including tumor and pathological characteristics, mode of detection, and contralateral breast cancer (CBC) have been estimated.[ - ] In 2019, the PRS with the highest discriminatory ability to date was developed and prospectively validated in the largest GWAS datasets available (79 studies in BCAC and more than 190,000 women in the U.K. Biobank), which incorporates information on 313 genetic variants and is optimized for ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer.[ ] Compared with women in the middle quintile, those in the highest 1% of PRS had 4.04-, 4.37-, and 2.78-fold risks of developing breast cancer overall, ER-positive disease, and ER-negative disease, respectively.[ ] Lifetime absolute risk (AR) of breast cancer by age 80 years for women in the lowest and highest 1% of PRS ranged from 2% to 31% for ER-positive breast cancer, while for ER-negative disease, the ARs ranged from 0.55% to 4%.[ ] Common genomic variants associated with the development of a first primary breast cancer are also associated with the development of CBC.[ ] Women in the highest quartile of the PRS had a 1.6-fold increased risk of developing CBC compared with the lowest quartile.[ ] Moreover, PRSs of breast and ovarian cancers have been assessed in women who are carriers of and pathogenic variants, and have been found to be predictive of cancer risk in these women, supporting the hypothesis of a shared polygenic component of cancer risk between the general population and variant carriers.[ ] The PRS for ER-negative disease had the strongest association with breast cancer risk in variant carriers, while the strongest association in variant carriers was seen for the overall breast cancer PRS. variant carriers had cumulative lifetime risks of 56% and 75% of developing breast cancer at the 10 and 90 percentile of the PRS, respectively. The ovarian cancer PRS was strongly associated with risk for both and variant carriers. For variant carriers, the ovarian cancer risk was 6% and 19% by age 80 years for those at the 10 and 90 percentile of PRS, respectively. The authors noted that the incorporation of the PRS into risk prediction models may better inform decisions on cancer risk management for this population.[ ] Two large studies have supported that PRSs can improve breast cancer risk stratification.[ , ] PRSs were most important in the breast cancer risk stratification of individuals with and pathogenic variants. After PRSs were incorporated, 30% of individuals with a pathogenic variant and nearly half of the individuals with an pathogenic variant dipped below a 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer. This is significant, since lifetime risk values greater than 20%  can prompt more frequent breast cancer screening and other types of clinical management.[ ] PRSs were also effective when stratifying breast cancer risk in noncarriers. Gallagher et al. analyzed case-control data from 150,962 women who had multigene hereditary cancer genetic testing. This study examined the impact of a PRS with 86 SNVs on individuals with pathogenic variants in , and . The PRS was predictive of breast cancer in  individuals with pathogenic variants. However, breast cancer risk stratification was more pronounced in noncarriers (OR, 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45–1.49) and pathogenic variant carriers (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.36–1.64) than in carriers of (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.10–1.32) or (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.12–1.34) pathogenic variants. The ORs for (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.21–1.55) and (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16–1.55) pathogenic variant carriers  were intermediate when compared with those of pathogenic variant carriers, pathogenic variant carriers, and noncarriers. Even though the PRS improved breast cancer risk stratification across all groups,  the PRS was most important for individuals with pathogenic variants and for noncarriers.[ ] Similarly, Gao et al. analyzed case-control data from 26,798 non-Hispanic White individuals with breast cancer and 26,127 controls using a PRS based on 105 SNVs. More than 95% of , , and pathogenic variant carriers had a 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer. In contrast, 52.5% of pathogenic variant carriers and 69.7% of pathogenic variant carriers without (FDRs)  with breast cancer had a 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer. This was also true in  78.8% of carriers and 89.9% of carriers  with an FDR with breast cancer.[ ] Several studies have also examined the extent to which clinical breast cancer risk prediction models can be improved by including information on known susceptibility SNVs, and reporting improved discriminatory accuracy after inclusion of the PRS.[ - ] For example, in a study combining PRS with clinical models, the AUC for predicting breast cancer before age 50 years improved by more than 20%.[ ] Clinical trials, including and , are in progress to study the potential clinical utility of the PRS for making screening decisions and understanding outcomes.[ ] Because PRSs have been largely developed and validated in populations of European ancestry, the utility and prediction accuracy of these PRSs in non-European populations is unknown. A large study examined whether known reproductive and lifestyle risk factors interact with PRSs to increase breast cancer risk and did not find a multiplicative interaction with established risk factors.[ ] In addition to GWAS interrogating common genetic variants, sequencing-based studies involving or [ ] are also identifying genes associated with breast cancer, such as , a rare, moderate-penetrance breast cancer .[ ] (Refer to the section in Cancer Genetics Overview for more information about whole-exome sequencing.) For more information, see the section in and : Cancer Risks and Management. As mismatch repair were identified as the genetic basis of Lynch syndrome, was identified as a common molecular marker of mismatch repair deficiency. Approximately 15% of colorectal cancers show microsatellite instability, while up to 28% of sporadic endometrial cancers have this molecular change.[ , ] Most frequently, sporadic tumors with microsatellite instability have hypermethylation of the promoter. In Lynch syndrome–related tumors showing microsatellite instability, there is typically loss of one or more of the proteins associated with the mismatch repair genes. Certain histopathologic features are also strongly suggestive of a microsatellite instability , including the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, peritumoral lymphocytes, undifferentiated carcinomas, and lower uterine segment tumors. Use of clinical criteria is one strategy of selection criteria for tumor testing.  Computer models have also been used to predict the probability of a mismatch repair and can be used in the absence of microsatellite instability or immunohistochemistry information.[ - ] Overall, however, there is a move towards universal testing of colorectal and endometrial tumors when tumor tissue is available. (Refer to the section in Genetics of Colorectal Cancer for more information.) Psychosocial research in the context of cancer genetic testing helps to define
psychological outcomes, interpersonal and effects, and cultural and
community responses.  This type of research also identifies behavioral factors that encourage or
impede and other health behaviors.  It can enhance decision making
about risk-reduction interventions, evaluate psychosocial interventions to
reduce distress and/or other negative sequelae related to risk notification and
genetic testing, provide data to help resolve ethical concerns, and predict the
interest in testing of various groups. Psychosocial and screening issues related to gynecologic cancers associated with Lynch syndrome are discussed in the section in Genetics of Colorectal Cancer. Comparison of uptake rates among studies in which counseling and testing were offered is challenging because of differences in methodologies, including the sampling strategy used, the recruitment setting, and testing through a research protocol with high-risk cohorts or . In a systematic review of 40 studies conducted before 2002 that had assessed genetic testing utilization, uptake rates varied widely and ranged from 25% to 96%, with an average uptake rate of 59%.[ ] Results of multivariate analysis found that genetic testing uptake was associated with having a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and with methodological features of the studies, including sampling strategies, recruitment settings, and how studies defined actual uptake versus the intention to have testing. Other factors have been positively correlated with uptake of genetic testing, although these findings are not consistent across all studies.  Psychological factors that have been positively correlated with testing uptake include greater cancer-specific distress and greater perceived risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer.  Having more cancer-affected relatives also has been correlated with greater testing uptake. summarizes the uptake of genetic testing in clinical and research cohorts in the United States. Several studies conducted in non-U.S. settings have examined the uptake of genetic testing.[ - ] In studies examining the uptake of testing among at-risk relatives of carriers of / pathogenic variants, uptake rates have averaged below 50% (range, 36%–48%), with higher uptake reported among female relatives than in male relatives.  Other factors associated with higher uptake of testing were not consistently reported among studies but have most commonly included being a parent and wanting to learn information about a child’s risk. In reviews that have examined the cumulative evidence concerning the predictors of uptake of / genetic testing, important predictors of testing uptake include older age, (AJ) heritage, unmarried status, a personal history of breast cancer, and a family history of breast cancer.  Studies recruiting participants in hospital settings had significantly higher recruitment rates than did studies recruiting participants in community settings.  Studies that required an immediate decision to test, rather than allowing delayed decision making, tended to report higher uptake rates.[ ]  However, there is evidence that women diagnosed with breast cancer are equally satisfied with genetic counseling (including information received and strength and timing of physician recommendations for counseling), whether they received genetic counseling before or after their definitive surgery for breast cancer.[ ]   Another review [ ] found that uptake of genetic testing for pathogenic variants was related to psychological factors (e.g., anxiety about breast cancer  and perceived risk of breast cancer) and demographic and medical factors (e.g., history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer, presence of children, and higher number of  [FDRs]).  Family members with a known pathogenic variant were more likely to pursue testing; those with more extensive knowledge of testing, heightened risk perceptions, beliefs that mammography would promote health benefit, and high intentions to undergo testing were more likely to follow through with testing.[ ] In a review of racial and ethnic differences that affect the uptake of testing, intention to undergo genetic testing in African American women was related to having at least one FDR with breast cancer or ovarian cancer, higher perceived risk of being a carrier, and less anticipatory guilt about the possibility of being a carrier.[ ] A systematic review found that certain racial and ethnic minority groups, including African American and Hispanic individuals, had more negative views and greater concerns about genetic counseling and testing when compared with White individuals. African American and Hispanic individuals were more likely to believe genetic testing could be used to show their ethnic group was inferior to other groups.  Additionally, African American and Hispanic individuals were found to have low awareness and knowledge about the importance of genetics in cancer, status, and genetic testing.[ ] Reasons cited for following through with testing included a desire  to learn about a child's risk, to feel relief from uncertainty, to inform screening or risk-reducing surgery decisions, and to inform important life decisions such as marriage and childbearing.[ , ] Among African American women, the most important reason for testing included motivation to help other relatives decide on genetic testing.[ ] Physician recommendation may be another motivator for testing.  In a retrospective study of 335 women considering genetic testing, 77% reported that they wanted the opinion of a genetics physician about whether they should be tested, and 49% wanted the opinion of their primary care provider.[ ]  However, there is some evidence of referral bias favoring those with a maternal family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer. In a Canadian retrospective review of 315 patients, those with a maternal family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer were 4.9 times (95% confidence interval, 3.6–6.7) more likely to be referred for a cancer genetics consultation by their physician than were those with a paternal family history ( < .001).[ ] Studies have found that physicians may not adequately assess paternal family history [ ] or may underestimate the significance of a paternal family history for genetic risk.[ - ] Other studies have shown that physician referral of patients who meet U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines for genetic counseling has been suboptimal.[ ] The uptake of testing to inform surgical treatment decisions when offered appears to be high in research cohorts;[ , ] however, findings from other studies suggest that testing is underutilized in clinical practice to inform breast cancer treatment decisions.[ , , ] Barriers to the use of testing to inform surgical treatment decisions, including lack of physician referral of newly diagnosed patients for genetic counseling, type of insurance coverage (such as Medicare or Medicaid), and challenges in the timing and coordination of testing, have been reported.[ , - ] In a randomized trial that provided proactive rapid genetic counseling (delivery of genetic counseling prior to surgery) compared with usual care for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, results suggested that although genetic counseling uptake was higher in the intervention arm, this did not translate into higher rates of genetic testing, receipt of results before surgery, or bilateral mastectomy decisions.[ ] Insurance coverage is an important consideration for individuals deciding whether to undergo genetic testing. (Refer to the section in the PDQ summary on for more information.) There are limited data on uptake of genetic counseling and testing among non-White populations, and further research will be needed to define factors influencing uptake in these populations.[ ]   The uptake of testing appears to vary across some racial and ethnic groups. A few studies have compared uptake rates between African American and White women.[ , ] In a case-control study of women who had been seen in a university-based primary care system, African American women with family histories of breast cancer or ovarian cancer were less likely to undergo testing than were White women who had similar histories.[ ] In another study among breast cancer patients who were counseled about risk in a clinical setting, lower uptake was reported among African American women than among White women.[ ] Notably, the racial differences observed in these studies do not appear to be explained by factors related to cost, access to care, risk factors for carrying a or pathogenic variant, or differences in psychosocial factors, including risk perceptions, worry, or attitudes toward testing. Several studies have examined uptake or “acceptance” of testing among African American individuals enrolled in genetic research programs. Among study enrollees from an African American kindred in Utah, 83% underwent testing.[ ] Age, perceived risk of being a carrier, and more extensive cancer knowledge predicted testing acceptance. Another study that recruited African American women  through physician and community referrals reported a testing acceptance rate of 22%.[ ] Predictors of test acceptance included having a higher probability of having a pathogenic variant, being married, and being less certain about one’s cancer risk. Finally, a third study that recruited at-risk African American women from an urban cancer screening clinic found that acceptors of testing were more knowledgeable about breast cancer genetics and perceived fewer barriers to testing, including negative emotional reactions, stigmatization concerns, and family-related guilt.[ ] While these are independent predictors of genetic testing uptake, they do not explain the disparities in testing uptake across different ethnic groups. What may explain these differences are several attitudes and beliefs held about testing by individuals from diverse populations. Work examining attitudes toward breast cancer genetic testing in Latino and African American populations indicates limited knowledge and awareness about testing but a generally receptive view once they are informed; in comparison with White populations, Latino and African American populations have relatively more concerns about testing. For example, in a qualitative study with 51 Latino individuals unselected for risk status, important findings included the fact that participants were highly interested in genetic testing for inherited cancer susceptibility, despite very limited knowledge about genetics.  One important barrier involved secrecy or embarrassment about family discussions of cancer and genetics, which could be addressed in intervention strategies.[ ]   Another qualitative study with 54 Latina women at risk of hereditary breast cancer showed that knowledge about counseling was low, although the women were interested in learning more about counseling to gain risk information for family members.  Barriers to counseling included life demands, cost, and language issues.[ ] A telephone survey of 314 patients from an inner-city network of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, health centers, 50% of whom were African American, found that most participants (57%)  (both African American and  White participants) felt that genetic testing to evaluate disease risk was a good idea; however, more African American participants than White participants thought that genetic testing would lead to racial discrimination (37% vs. 22%, respectively) and that genetics research was unethical  and tampered with nature (20% vs. 11%, respectively).[ ] Finally, in a study of 222 women in Savannah, Georgia, where most had neither a personal history (70%) nor a family history (60%)  of breast cancer, African American women (who comprised 26% of the sample) were less likely to be aware of breast cancer genes and genetic testing.  Awareness was also related to higher income, higher education level, and having a family breast cancer history.  However, 74% of the entire sample expressed willingness to be tested for breast cancer susceptibility.[ ] In a sample of 146 African American women meeting criteria for pathogenic variant testing, women born outside the United States reported higher levels of anticipated negative emotional reactions (e.g., fear, hopelessness, and lack of confidence that they could emotionally handle testing).  Higher levels of breast cancer–specific distress were associated with anticipated negative emotional reactions, confidentiality concerns, and anticipated guilt regarding the family impact of breast cancer genetic testing.[ ] A future orientation (e.g., "I often think about how my actions today will affect my health when I am older") was associated with overall perceived benefits of breast cancer genetic testing in this population (n = 140); however, future orientation was also found to be positively associated with family-related cons of testing, including family guilt and worry regarding the impact of testing on the family.[ ] There are racial differences in provider discussion and patient uptake of genetic testing for variants in . A study of women aged 18 to 64 years and diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2007 and 2009 found that, even after adjusting for pathogenic variant risk, African American women were less likely to report having received a physician recommendation for genetic testing. There was no difference across all races in concerns that testing was too expensive and only minimal differences in testing attitudes or insurance concerns were found, none of which influenced testing uptake.[ ] A study of breast or ovarian cancer survivors (N = 50) eligible for / genetic testing found that 48% were referred for genetic counseling and testing and/or had undergone genetic testing. Individuals with higher breast cancer genetics knowledge and higher self-efficacy were more likely to have engaged in genetic counseling and testing.[ ]  In a study of women with invasive breast cancer diagnosed before age 50 years between 2009 and 2012 who were identified through the Florida Cancer Data System state registry and eligible for genetic testing on the basis of existing guidelines, African American individuals were less likely to report a discussion with their health care provider and undergo genetic testing.[ ] The same study found similar overall testing rates in Hispanic (61%) and non-Hispanic (65%) White individuals. However, testing rates were lower among Hispanic individuals who spoke primarily Spanish at home (50% Spanish speaking vs. 69% English speaking; = .0009), and in general, Hispanic individuals were less likely to have been referred for genetic testing.[ ] However, this finding is not consistent across all studies.  In a study of women aged 20 to 79 years with ductal carcinoma or invasive breast cancer identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry in Georgia and Los Angeles County, all eligible for / genetic testing on the basis of existing guidelines, no ethnic differences were detected in receipt of genetic counseling or physician-directed discussion about genetic testing.[ ] There is evidence that primary reasons for declining testing involves being childless, which reduces any family motivations for testing; and concerns about the negative ramifications of testing, including difficulty retaining insurance or concerns about personal health. Limited data are available about the characteristics of at-risk individuals who decline to be tested or have never been tested.  It is difficult to access samples of test decliners because they may be reluctant to participate in research studies. Studies of genetic testing uptake are difficult to compare because people may decline at different points and with different amounts of pretest education and counseling. One study found that 43% of affected and individuals from hereditary breast/ovarian cancer families who completed a baseline interview regarding testing declined to be tested. Most individuals who declined testing chose not to participate in educational sessions. Decliners were more likely to be male and be unmarried and have fewer relatives with breast cancer. Decliners who had high levels of cancer-related stress had higher levels of depression. Decliners lost to follow-up were significantly more likely to be affected with cancer.[ ] Another study looked at a small number (n = 13) of women decliners who carried a 25% to 50% probability of harboring a pathogenic variant; these nontested women were more likely to be childless and to have higher levels of education. This study showed that most women decided not to undergo the test after serious deliberation about the risks and benefits. Satisfaction with frequent was given as one reason for nontesting by most of these women.[ ] Other reasons for declining included having no children and becoming acquainted with breast/ovarian cancer in the family relatively early in their lives.[ , ] A third study evaluated characteristics of 34 individuals who declined testing in a large multicenter study in the United Kingdom. Decliners were younger than a national sample of test acceptors, and female decliners had lower mean scores on a measure of cancer worry. Although 78% of test decliners/deferrers felt that their health was at risk, they reported that learning about their pathogenic variant status would cause them to worry about the following: Apprehension about the impact of the test result was a more important factor in the decision to decline testing than were concrete burdens such as time required to travel to a genetics clinic and time spent away from work, family, and social obligations.[ ] In 15% (n = 31) of individuals from 13 hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) families who underwent genetic education and counseling and declined testing for a documented pathogenic variant in the family, positive changes in family relationships were reported—specifically, greater expressiveness and cohesion—compared with those who pursued testing.[ ] Testing for pathogenic variants has been almost universally limited to adults older than 18
years.  The risks of testing children for adult-onset disorders, such as breast
and ovarian cancers, as inferred from developmental data on children’s medical 
understanding and ability to provide informed consent, have been outlined in
several reports.[ - ] Studies suggest that individuals who have undergone genetic testing or who are adult offspring of individuals who have had testing are generally not in favor of testing minors.[ , ] Although the data are limited, research suggests that males, pathogenic variant , and those whose mothers did not have personal histories of breast cancer may be more likely to favor genetic testing in minors in general.[ ]  Of those who had minor children at the time the study was conducted, only 17% stated a preference for having their own children tested.  Concerns regarding testing of minors included psychological risks and insufficient maturity. Potential benefits included the ability to influence health behaviors.[ ] No data exist on the testing of children for pathogenic variants, although some researchers believe it is necessary to test the validity
of assumptions underlying the general prohibition of testing children for
genetic variants associated with breast and ovarian cancers and other adult-onset diseases.[ - ] In one study,  20 children (aged  11–17 y)  of a selected group of mothers undergoing genetic testing (80% of whom previously had breast cancer and all of whom had discussed testing with their children) completed self-report questionnaires on their health beliefs and attitudes toward cancer, feelings related to cancer, and behavioral problems.[ ] Ninety percent of children thought they would want cancer risk information as adults; half worried about themselves or a family  member developing cancer. There was no evidence of emotional distress or behavioral problems. The emerging literature in this area suggests that risk perceptions,
health beliefs, psychological status, and personality characteristics are important factors in
decision making about breast/ovarian cancer genetic testing.  Many women
presenting at academic centers for testing arrive with a strong belief
that they have a pathogenic variant, having decided they want genetic testing, but
possessing little information about the risks or limitations of testing.[ ] Most mean scores of psychological functioning at baseline for subjects in genetic counseling studies were within normal limits.[ ]  Nonetheless, a subset of subjects in many genetic counseling studies present with elevated anxiety, depression, or cancer worry.[ , ]  Identification of these individuals is essential to prevent adverse outcomes. In a study of 205 women pursuing genetic counseling, interactions among cancer worry, breast cancer risk perception, and perceived severity of having a breast cancer were found such that those with high worry, high breast cancer risk perception, and low perceived severity were twice as likely to follow through with testing than others.[ ] A general tendency to overestimate inherited risk of breast and ovarian cancer
has been noted in at-risk populations,[ - ] in cancer patients,[ , , ] in spouses of breast and ovarian cancer patients,[ ] and among
women in the general population.[ - ] but underestimation of breast cancer risk in higher-risk and average-risk women also has been reported.[ ]  This overestimation may encourage a belief that genetic testing will be more than it is currently thought
to be.  Some evidence exists that even counseling does not dissuade women at
low to moderate risk from the belief that testing could be valuable.[ ] 
 Overestimation of both breast and ovarian cancer risk has been associated with nonadherence to physician-recommended screening practices.[ , ] A meta-analysis of 12 studies of outcomes of genetic counseling for breast/ovarian cancer showed that counseling improved the accuracy of risk perception.[ ] Women appear to be the prime communicators within families about the family 
history of breast cancer.[ ]  Higher numbers of maternal versus paternal
transmission cases are reported,[ ] likely due to family communication
patterns, to the misconception that breast cancer risk can only be transmitted
through the mother, and to the greater difficulty in recognizing paternal
family histories because of the need to identify more distant relatives with
cancer.  In an analysis of 2,505 women participating in the Family Healthware Impact Trial,[ ] not only was evidence of underreporting of paternal family history identified, but also women reported a lower level of perceived breast cancer risk with a paternal versus maternal breast cancer family history.[ ] Physicians and counselors taking a family history are encouraged to
elicit paternal and maternal family histories of breast, ovarian, or
other associated cancers.[ ] The accuracy of reported family history of breast or ovarian cancer varies;
some studies found levels of accuracy above 90%,[ , ] with others finding
more errors in the reporting of cancer in second-degree relatives (SDRs) or more distant
relatives [ ] or in age of onset of cancer.[ ]  Less accuracy has been found in the reporting of cancers other
than breast cancer.  Ovarian cancer history was reported with 60% accuracy in
one study compared with 83% accuracy in breast cancer history.[ ]  Providers
should be aware that there are a few published cases of Munchausen syndrome in
reporting of false family breast cancer history.[ ]  Much more common is
erroneous reporting of family cancer history due to unintentional errors or
gaps in knowledge, related in some cases to the early death of potential
maternal informants about cancer family history.[ ]
(Refer to the section in Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling for more information.) Targeted written,[ , ] video, CD-ROM, interactive computer programs and websites,[ - ] and culturally targeted educational materials [ - ] may be effective and efficient methods of increasing knowledge about the pros and cons of genetic testing.  Such supplemental materials may allow more efficient use of the time allotted for pretest education and counseling by genetics and primary care providers and may discourage individuals without appropriate indication of risk from seeking genetic testing.[ ] Counseling for breast cancer risk typically involves individuals with family
histories that are potentially attributable to or .  It also, however,
may include individuals with family histories of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, Cowden syndrome, or Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.[ ]  (Refer to the section of this summary for more information.) Management strategies for carriers may involve decisions about the nature, frequency, and
timing of screening and surveillance procedures, chemoprevention, risk-reducing surgery, and use of
hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The utilization of breast conservation and
radiation as cancer therapy for women who are carriers may be influenced by knowledge of pathogenic variant status.  (Refer to the section in and : Cancer Risks and Management for more information.) Counseling also includes consideration of related psychosocial concerns and
discussion of planned family communication and the responsibility to warn other
family members about the possibility of having an increased risk of breast,
ovarian, and other cancers.  Data suggest that individual responses to being tested as adults are influenced by the results status of other family members.[ , ] Management of anxiety and distress are important
not only as quality-of-life factors, but also because high anxiety may
interfere with the understanding and integration of complex genetic and medical
information and adherence to screening.[ - ]    Formal, objective evaluation of these outcomes are well documented.  (Refer to the and sections of this summary for more information.) Published descriptions of counseling programs for (and subsequently for ) testing include strategies for gathering a family history, assessing
eligibility for testing, communicating the considerable volume of relevant
information about breast/ovarian cancer genetics and associated medical and
psychosocial risks and benefits, and discussion of specialized ethical
considerations about confidentiality and family communication.[ - ] 
Participant distress, intrusive thoughts about cancer, coping style, and social
support were assessed in many prospective testing candidates.  The psychosocial
outcomes evaluated in these programs have included changes in knowledge about
the genetics of breast/ovarian cancer after counseling, risk comprehension,
psychological adjustment, family and social functioning, and reproductive and
health behaviors.[ ] A Dutch study of communication processes and satisfaction levels of going through cancer genetic counseling for inherited cancer syndromes indicated that asking more medical questions (by the counselor), providing more psychosocial information, and longer eye contact by the counselor were associated with lower satisfaction levels. The provision of medical information by the counselor was most highly related to satisfaction and perception that needs have been fulfilled.[ ] Many of the psychosocial outcome studies involve specialized, highly selected
research populations, some of which were utilized to map and clone and .  One such example is K2082, an extensively studied kindred of more than 800
members of a Utah Mormon family in which a pathogenic variant accounts for the
observed increased rates of breast and ovarian cancer.  A study of the
understanding that members of this kindred have about breast/ovarian cancer
genetics found that, even in breast cancer research populations, there was
incomplete knowledge about associated risks of colon and prostate cancer, the
existence of options for risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO),
and the complexity of existing psychosocial risks.[ ]  
A meta-analysis of 21 studies found that genetic counseling was effective in increasing knowledge and improved the accuracy of perceived risk. Genetic counseling did not have a statistically significant long-term impact on affective outcomes including anxiety, distress, or cancer-specific worry and the behavioral outcome of cancer surveillance activities.[ ] These prospective studies, however, were characterized by a heterogeneity of measures of cancer-specific worry and inconsistent findings in effects of change from baseline.[ ] Although there were initial concerns about the possibility of adverse emotional consequences from testing, most studies conducted over the years have shown low levels of psychological distress among both carriers and noncarriers, particularly over the longer term.[ - ] In a meta-analysis examining cancer-specific distress over short (0–4 weeks), moderate (5–24 weeks), and long (25–52 weeks) periods of time since the receipt of testing results, carriers were found to demonstrate increased levels of  distress shortly after receiving results, with levels returning to baseline within moderate and long periods of time.[ ] In contrast, noncarriers and those with inconclusive results showed reduced levels of distress over time.[ , ] Psychological distress patterns were found to vary as a function of several factors, including the cancer history of the individual and the country within which the study was conducted. Carriers with a personal history of cancer experienced small decreases in distress over time, whereas no changes were observed among carriers without a personal history of cancer. Among individuals with inconclusive results, greater decreases in distress were observed among those without a cancer history than among those with a cancer history.  Among noncarriers, those in the United States experienced significantly greater decreases in psychological distress than  noncarriers from Europe and Australia.  A study conducted in Austria noted that certain subgroups of consultands experienced greater distress, including those who were older, had a more recent cancer diagnosis, or those who had received counseling but declined testing.[ ] Several studies have reported on emotional outcomes over longer follow-up periods (i.e., greater than 12 months after disclosure) than those reported in the meta-analysis described above.[ ] In a U.K. study, cancer-related worry did not differ between carriers and noncarriers at 3 years of follow-up.[ ] Two U.S.-based studies published since the meta-analytic review [ ] have reported similar findings among women who were surveyed more than 3 years after receipt of test results.[ , ]  In a cross-sectional study,[ ] 167 women who were surveyed more than 4 years after receiving test results reported low levels of genetic testing–specific concerns, as measured using the Multidimensional Impact of Cancer Risk Assessment Scale.[ ]  In multivariate regression models, carriers of pathogenic variants were significantly more likely to experience distress than were noncarriers. In a second study,[ ] 464 women were followed prospectively for a median of 5 years (range, 3.4–9.1 y) after testing. Among both affected and unaffected participants, carriers reported significantly higher levels of distress, uncertainty (affected only), perceived stress (affected only), and lower positive testing experiences (unaffected only) than women who received negative results for a known pathogenic variant in the family.[ ] Although both studies [ , ] reported greater distress among carriers than among noncarriers, the level of distress was not reflective of clinically significant dysfunction. Although most studies have reported that a positive test result has a relatively minimal impact on psychological distress, many of these studies were conducted among families with a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer who underwent extensive pretest genetic counseling. Therefore, emotional responses may not generalize to individuals who test under different contexts. For example, individuals who are tested with population screening may not have a family history of cancer.[ - ]  Although pretest genetic counseling is recommended, this is not always done when genetic testing is ordered by nongenetic providers [ ] or directly through commercial companies.[ , ] For example, in a Canadian study of 2,080 Jewish women who participated in a population-based genetic screening study to test for three pathogenic variants common in families of Jewish heritage, women were not offered in-person genetic counseling but were given a pamphlet on genetic testing for before they provided a DNA sample. One year after genetic testing, women who were positive for a pathogenic variant (n = 18) showed significant increases in cancer-specific distress, whereas no changes in distress were observed among women who were negative for a pathogenic variant.[ ]  The mean distress score on the Impact of Event Scale for the 18 women with a known pathogenic variant was 25.3 (range, 2–51);  10 of 18 women (56%) scored within moderate (26–43) (n = 7) or severe (44+) (n = 3) ranges. It is unclear from this study whether the increase in distress observed at 1 year of follow-up was due to the lack of in-person genetic counseling, or whether the lower levels of distress at baseline observed were because the women in the study were low risk but eligible for testing because of their ancestry. A follow-up study with this cohort found that distress decreased between 1 to 2 years after testing and that changes in distress varied by risk-reduction options undertaken by carriers. Specifically, those who had undergone RRM or risk-reducing oophorectomy experienced significant decreases in distress compared with those who did not have either surgery.[ ] Another smaller qualitative study also supports these findings.[ ] Similarly, the impact of direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing through commercial companies requires further evaluation. Case studies have reported adverse emotional responses after receipt of a positive result from DTC genetic testing, suggesting the need for further evaluation of the emotional outcomes of women undergoing genetic testing through commercial companies.[ , ] Only one study, conducted by a commercial company, has attempted to evaluate the impact of testing in this context.[ ] A total of 32 individuals (16 women and 16 men) who tested positive for one of three  common in AJs completed semi-structured interviews. None of the carriers reported extreme anxiety, although some experienced moderate anxiety (13%) or initial disappointment and anxiety that dissipated over time (28%). These findings should be interpreted with caution given that only 24% (32 of 136) of invited carriers of pathogenic variants participated in the study, raising concerns about selection bias. Despite evidence of a short-term increase in distress after the receipt of genetic testing results, any adverse responses to a positive carrier status dissipate within 12 months.[ ] Additional research is needed to examine emotional outcomes for those who are not provided genetic counseling before testing.[ ] It is increasingly common for women with breast cancer to pursue genetic counseling and testing at the time of diagnosis to assist with treatment decision making. (Refer to the section for more information.)  Given that women with new breast cancer diagnoses are likely to experience some distress, concerns have been raised about the potential for additional adverse psychological implications of rapid genetic counseling and testing (RGT) between diagnosis and surgery.[ , ] However, data from several studies,[ - ] including a large observational study [ ] and a randomized trial,[ ]    provided evidence indicating that there were no adverse psychological effects associated with RGT. For example, an observational study analyzed 1,007 with newly diagnosed breast cancers from four Canadian academic centers. These patients underwent RGT and  adverse psychological effects were not noted at one week or one year posttesting.[ ] There were no differences in anxiety, distress, or depression between carriers (6% of the study population) and those with uninformative results in the short-term. However, after one year, carriers had significantly lower depression scores when compared with patients who had uninformative, negative results.  Depression scores  were within the normal range for both groups, and these scores did not reach  depression levels that were clinically significant. Factors associated with lower levels of psychological functioning included lower educational levels, not having family histories of cancer, and undergoing bilateral mastectomies.  Of note, women who had a variant of uncertain significance in the genes and a bilateral mastectomy had higher depression scores than carriers. One randomized controlled trial found that patients undergoing rapid genetic counseling and testing felt more actively involved in treatment decision making than those receiving standard care.[ ] Family communication about genetic testing for cancer susceptibility, and 
specifically about the results of genetic testing, is complex.  Age and gender appear to be important variables in the disclosure of genetic test results.  Studies have documented that older women were more likely to disclose genetic test results (especially to their daughters) than  younger women.[ , ] Female carriers are more likely to disclose their genetic test results
to other family members [ ] than
are male carriers.[ , ]  Among males, noncarriers were more likely than carriers
to tell their sisters and children the results of their tests. carriers who disclosed their results to sisters had a slight decrease in
psychological distress, compared with a slight increase in distress for carriers
who chose not to tell their sisters.  One study found that men reported greater difficulty disclosing a known pathogenic variant to family members than  women (90% vs. 70%).[ ] Family communication of test results to relatives is another factor affecting participation in testing. There have been more studies of communication with FDRs and SDRs than with more distant family members. Studies have investigated the process and content of communication among sisters about test results.[ , ] Study results suggest that both carriers of pathogenic variants [ ] and women with uninformative results [ , ] communicate with sisters to provide them with genetic risk information. Similar findings were reported in women with uninformative results disclosing test results to their daughters.[ ] Among relatives with whom genetic test results were not discussed, the most important reason given was that the affected women were not close to their relatives [ ] or had a poor relationship with them.[ ] Studies found that women with a pathogenic variant more often shared their results with their mother and adult sisters and daughters than with their father and adult brothers and sons.[ , , , - ] A study that evaluated communication of test results to FDRs at 4 months postdisclosure found that participants were more likely to inform brothers of their results if the pathogenic variant was inherited through the paternal line.[ ] Another study found that disclosure was limited mainly to FDRs, and dissemination of information to distant relatives was problematic.[ ] Age was a significant factor in informing distant relatives with younger patients being more willing to communicate their genetic test result.[ , , ] Additionally, one study found that lower genetic worry, higher interest in genomic information, carrying a or pathogenic variant, or having never been married was associated with communication to more family members.[ ] In contrast, a longer time interval since diagnosis was associated with communication to fewer family members.[ ] A few in-depth qualitative studies have looked at issues associated with family communication about genetic testing. Although the findings from these studies may not be generalizable to the larger population of at-risk individuals, they illustrate the complexity of issues involved in conveying hereditary cancer risk information in families.[ ]  On the basis of 15 interviews conducted with women attending a familial cancer genetics clinic, the authors concluded that while women felt a sense of duty to discuss genetic testing with their relatives, they also experienced conflicting feelings of uncertainty, respect, and isolation.  Decisions about whom in the family to inform and how to inform them about hereditary cancer and genetic testing may be influenced by tensions between women's need to fulfill social roles and their responsibilities toward themselves and others.[ ] Another qualitative study of 21 women who attended a familial breast and ovarian cancer genetics clinic suggested that some women may find it difficult to communicate about inherited cancer risk with their partners and with certain relatives, especially brothers, because of their own fears and worries about cancer.[ ]  This study also suggested that how genetic risk information is shared within families may depend on the existing norms for communicating about cancer in general.  For example, family members may be generally open to sharing information about cancer with each other, may selectively avoid discussing cancer information with certain family members to protect themselves or other relatives from negative emotional reactions, or may ask a specific relative to act as an intermediary to  disclosure of information to other family members.[ ]  The potential importance of individuals outside the family, such as friends, as both confidantes about inherited cancer risk information and as sources of support for coping with this information was also noted in the study.[ ] A study of 31 mothers with a documented pathogenic variant explored patterns of dissemination to children.[ ] Of those who chose to disclose test results to their children, age of offspring was the most important factor. Fifty percent of the children who were told were  aged 20  to 29 years and slightly more than 25% of the children were aged 19 years or younger. Sons and daughters were notified in equal numbers. More than 70% of mothers informed their children within a week of learning their test result. Ninety-three percent of mothers who chose not to share their results with their children indicated that it was because their children were too young. These findings were consistent with three other studies showing that children younger than 13 years were less likely to be informed about test 
results compared with older children.[ , , ] Another study of 187 mothers undergoing testing evaluated their need for resources to prepare for a facilitated conversation about sharing their testing results with their children. Seventy-eight percent of mothers were interested in three or more resources, including literature (93%), family counseling (86%), talk to prior participants (79%), and support groups (54%).[ ] A longitudinal study of 153 women self-referred for genetic testing for and pathogenic variants and 118 of their partners evaluated communication about genetic testing and distress before testing and at 6 months 
posttesting.[ ] The study found that most couples discussed the decision to undergo testing (98%), most test participants felt their partners were supportive, and most women disclosed test results to their partners (97%, n = 148). Test participants who felt their partners were supportive during pretest discussions experienced less distress after disclosure, and 
partners who felt more comfortable sharing concerns with test participants pretest experienced less distress after disclosure. Six-month follow-up revealed that 22% of participants felt the need to talk about the testing experience with their partners in the week before the interview. Most participants (72%, n = 107) reported comfort in sharing concerns with their partners, and 5% (n = 7) reported relationship strain as a result of genetic testing. In couples in which the woman had a positive genetic test result, more relationship strain, more protective buffering of their partners, and more discussion of related concerns were reported than in couples in which the woman had a true-negative or uninformative result.[ ] A study of 561 FDRs of women who had undergone / genetic testing found that 22% of FDRs did not recall being informed of the genetic test results despite the women reporting that the results had been shared.[ ] Men were less likely to recall receiving the results ( > .001). Of those with recall about receiving the test results, 10.5% of FDRs did not recall the findings. For those with recall of the results, 17.9% of FDRs had an interpretation that was discordant with the correct results. Accuracy of test results recall was greater for informative test results (those that were either true positive or true negative) ( = .029). However, regardless of the test results, FDRs perceived the cancer risk to be higher before they learned of the findings than after (74%  and 53% of FDRs reported that they believed their risk for cancer was greater than average before and after hearing test results, respectively). There is a small but growing body of literature regarding psychological effects in men who have a family history of breast cancer and who are considering or have had testing. A qualitative study of 22 men from 16 high-risk families in Ireland revealed that more men in the study with daughters were tested than men without daughters.  These men reported little communication with relatives about the illness, with some men reporting being excluded from discussion about cancer 
among female family members.  Some men in the study also reported actively avoiding open discussion with daughters and other relatives.[ ] In contrast, a study of 59 men testing positive for a pathogenic variant found that most men participated in family discussions about breast and/or ovarian cancer. However, fewer than half of the men participated in family discussions about risk-reducing surgery. The main reason given for having testing was concern for their children and a need for certainty about whether they could have transmitted the pathogenic variant to their children. In this study, 79% of participating men had at least one daughter. Most of these men described how their relationships had been strengthened after receipt of results, helping communication in the family and greater understanding.[ ] Men in both studies expressed fears of developing cancer themselves.  Irish men especially reported 
fear of cancer in sexual organs. One study assessed 212 individuals from 13   families with HBOC who received genetic counseling and were offered testing for documented pathogenic variants in the family. Individuals who were not tested were found 6 to 9 months later to have significantly greater increases in family expressiveness and cohesiveness compared with those who were tested. Individuals who were randomly assigned to a client-centered versus problem-solving genetic counseling intervention had a significantly greater reduction in conflict, regardless of the test decision.[ ] Many studies have looked at the psychological effects in women of having a high risk of developing cancer, either on the basis of carrying a pathogenic variant or having a strong family history of cancer.  Some studies have also examined the effects on the partners of such women. A Canadian study assessed 59 spouses of women found to have a pathogenic variant.  All were supportive of their spouses’ decision to undergo genetic testing and 17% wished they had been more involved in the genetic testing process.  Spouses who reported that genetic testing had no impact on their relationship had long-term relationships (mean duration 27 years).  Forty-six  percent of spouses reported that their major concern was of their partner dying of cancer.  Nineteen percent were concerned their spouse would develop cancer and 14% were concerned their children would also be carriers of pathogenic variants.[ ] In a U.S. study, 118 partners of women who underwent genetic testing for pathogenic variants in and completed a survey before testing and then again 6 months after result disclosure.  At 6 months, only 10 partners reported that they had not been told of the test result.  Ninety-one percent reported that the testing had not caused strain on their relationship.  Partners who were comfortable sharing concerns before testing experienced less distress after testing.  Protective buffering was not found to impact distress levels of partners.[ ] An Australian study of 95 unaffected women at high risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer (13 carriers of pathogenic variants and 82 with unknown variant status) and their partners showed that although the majority of male partners had distress levels comparable to a normative population sample, 10% had significant levels of distress that indicated the need for further clinical intervention. Men with a high monitoring coping style and greater perceived breast cancer risk for their wives reported higher levels of distress. Open communication between the men and their partners and the occurrence of a cancer-related event in the wife’s family in the last year were associated with lower distress levels. When men were asked what kind of information and support they would like for themselves and their partners, 57.9% reported that they would like more information about breast and ovarian cancer, and 32.6% said they would like more support in dealing with their partner's risk. Twenty-five percent of men had suggestions on how to improve services for partners of high-risk women, including strategies on how to best support their partner, greater encouragement from  health care professionals to attend appointments, and meeting with other partners.[ ] A review of this literature reported that the testing process may be distressing for male partners, particularly for those with spouses identified as carriers. Male partner distress appears to be associated with their beliefs about the woman’s breast cancer risk, lack of couple communication, and feelings of alienation from the testing process.[ ] A review of the literature on the experiences of males in families with a known and pathogenic variant reported that while the data are limited, men from variant-positive families are less likely than females to participate in communication regarding genetics at every level, including the counseling and testing process. Men are less likely to be informed of genetic test results received by female relatives, and most men from these families do not pursue their own genetic testing.[ ] A study of Dutch men at increased risk of having inherited a pathogenic variant reported a tendency for the men to deny or minimize the emotional effects of their risk status, and to focus on medical implications for their female relatives. Men in these families, however, also reported considerable distress in relation to their female relatives.[ ]  In another study of male psychological functioning during breast cancer testing, 28 men belonging to 18 different high-risk families (with a 25% or 50% risk of having inherited a pathogenic variant) participated.  The study purpose was to analyze distress in males at risk of carrying a pathogenic variant who 
applied for genetic testing.  Of the men studied, most had low 
pretest distress; scores were lowest for men who were optimistic or who did not have daughters. Most carriers of pathogenic variants had normal levels of anxiety and depression and reported no guilt, though some anticipated increased distress and feelings of responsibility if their daughters developed breast or ovarian cancer. None of the noncarriers reported feeling guilty.[ ] In one study,[ ]  adherence to recommended screening guidelines after testing was analyzed.  In this study, more than half of male carriers of pathogenic variants did not adhere to the screening guidelines recommended after disclosure of genetic test results. These findings are consistent with those for female carriers of pathogenic variants.[ , ] A multicenter U.K. cohort study examined prospective outcomes of testing in 193 individuals, of which 20% were men aged 28 to 86 years. Men’s distress levels were low, did not differ among carriers and noncarriers, and did not change from baseline (before genetic testing) to the 3-year follow-up. Twenty-two percent of male carriers of pathogenic variants received colorectal cancer screening and 44% received prostate cancer screening;[ ] however, it is unclear whether men in this study were following age-appropriate screening guidelines. Several studies have explored communication of test results to at-risk children. Across all studies, the rate of disclosure to children ranging in age from 4 to 25 years is approximately 50%.[ , , , , - ]   In general, age of offspring was the most important factor in deciding whether to disclose test results.  In one study of 31 mothers disclosing their test results, 50% of the children who were informed of the results were aged 20 to 29 years and slightly more than 25% of the children were aged 19 years or younger. Sons and daughters were notified in equal numbers.[ ] Similarly, in another study of 42 female carriers of pathogenic variants, 83% of offspring older than age 18 years were told of the results, while only 21% of offspring aged 13 years or younger were told.[ ] Several studies have also looked at the timing of disclosure to children after parents receive their test results. Although the majority of children were told within a week to several months after results disclosure,[ , , ] some parents chose to delay disclosure.[ ] Reasons for delaying disclosure included waiting for the child to get older, allowing time for the parent to adjust to the information, and waiting until results could be shared in person (in the case of adult children living away from home).[ ] In one study, participants
who told children younger than 13 years about their carrier status had
increased distress, and those who did not tell their young children experienced
a slight decrease in distress. Communication with young children was found to be influenced by developmental variables such as age and style of parent/child communication.[ ] One study looked at the reaction of children to results disclosure or the effect on the parent-child relationship of communicating the results.[ ] With regard to offspring’s understanding of the information, almost half of parents from one study reported that their child did not appear to understand the significance of a positive test result, although older children were reported to have a better understanding. This same study also showed that 48% of parents reported at least one negative reaction in their child, ranging from anxiety or concern (22%) to crying and fear (26%). It should be noted, however, that in this study children's level of understanding and reactions to the test result were measured qualitatively and based only on the parents' perception. Also, given the retrospective design of the study, there was a potential for recall bias. There were no significant differences in emotional reaction depending on age or gender of the child. Lastly, 65% of parents reported no change in their relationship with their child, while 5 parents (22%) reported a strengthening of their relationship. Interestingly, a large multicenter study of 869 mother-daughter pairs (the daughters were aged 6 to 13 y) found that girls with a family history of breast cancer or a familial pathogenic variant   compared with those without such family histories had better psychosocial adjustment by maternal report.[ ]  However, based on a combination of maternal report and direct assessment of girls aged 10 to 13 years,  girls with family histories of breast cancer or familial pathogenic variants experienced greater breast cancer–specific distress and a higher perceived risk of breast cancer  than their peers without such family histories.  Moreover, higher daughter distress was associated with higher maternal distress. A similarly designed study in older girls, aged 11 to 19 years, found that higher breast cancer–specific distress in daughters was associated with perceived risk and maternal distress. This older age group had higher self-esteem than did their peers without a family history of breast cancer.[ ] Another study of 187 mothers undergoing testing evaluated their need for resources to prepare for a facilitated conversation about sharing their testing results with their children. Seventy-eight percent of mothers were interested in three or more resources, including literature (93%), family counseling (86%), talking to prior participants (79%), and support groups (54%).[ ] Testing for has been almost universally limited to adults older than 18
years.  The risks of testing children for adult-onset disorders (such as breast
and ovarian cancer), as inferred from developmental data on children’s medical 
understanding and ability to provide informed consent, have been outlined in
several reports.[ - ]  Surveys of parental interest in testing children
for adult-onset hereditary cancers suggest that parents are more eager to
test their children than to be tested themselves for a breast cancer gene,
suggesting potential conflicts for providers.[ , ]  In a general population
survey in the United States, 71% of parents said that it was moderately, very,
or extremely likely that if they carried a breast-cancer predisposing pathogenic variant,
they would test a 13-year-old daughter now to determine her breast cancer
gene status.[ ]  To date, no data exist on the testing of children for , though some researchers believe it is necessary to test the validity
of assumptions underlying the general prohibition of testing of children for
breast/ovarian cancer and other adult-onset disease genes.[ - ] In one study,  20 children (aged  11–17 y)  of a selected group of mothers undergoing genetic testing (80% of whom previously had breast cancer and all of whom had discussed testing with their children) completed self-report questionnaires on their health beliefs and attitudes toward cancer, feelings related to cancer, and behavioral problems.[ ] Ninety percent of children thought they would want cancer risk information as adults; half worried about themselves or a family  member developing cancer. There was no evidence of emotional distress or behavioral problems. Another study by this group [ ] found that 1 month after disclosure of genetic test results, 53% of 42 enrolled mothers of children aged 8 to 17 years had discussed their result with one or more of their children. Age of the child rather than pathogenic variant status of the mother influenced whether they were told, as did family health communication style. The possibility of transmitting a pathogenic variant to a child may pose a concern to families affected by HBOC,[ ] perhaps to the extent that some carriers may avoid childbearing.[ , ] These concerns also may prompt women to consider using prenatal testing methods to help reduce the risk of transmission.[ , ] Prenatal diagnosis is an encompassing term used to refer to any medical procedure conducted to assess the presence of a genetic disorder in a fetus. Methods include amniocentesis and chorionic villous sampling (CVS).[ , ] Both procedures carry some risk of miscarriage and some evidence suggests fetal defects may result from using these tests.[ , ] Moreover, discovering the fetus is a carrier for a genetic defect may impose a difficult decision for couples regarding pregnancy continuation or termination. An alternative to these tests is preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), a procedure used to test fertilized embryos for genetic disorders before uterine implantation,[ , , ] thereby avoiding the potential dangers associated with amniocentesis and CVS and the decision to terminate a pregnancy. Using the information obtained from the genetic testing, potential parents can decide whether or not to implant. PGT can be used to detect pathogenic variants in hereditary cancer predisposing genes, including .[ , ] In the United States, a series of studies has evaluated awareness, interest (e.g., would consider using PGT), and attitudes related to PGT among members of Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered (FORCE), an advocacy organization focused on individuals at increased risk of HBOC.[ , , ] The first study was a web-based survey of 283 members,[ ] the second included 205 attendees of the 2007 annual FORCE conference,[ ] and the third was a web-based survey of 962 members.[ , ] These studies have documented low levels of awareness, with 20% to 32% of study respondents reporting having heard of PGT before study participation.[ , ] With respect to interest in PGT, the first study [ ] found only 13% of women would be likely to use PGT, whereas, 33% of respondents in the subsequent FORCE studies reported that they would consider using PGT.[ , ] In the third FORCE-based study (n = 962),[ ] multivariable analysis revealed PGT interest was associated with the desire to have more children, having previously had any prenatal genetic test, and previous awareness of PGT. Attitudinal predictors of interest in PGT included agreement that others at risk of HBOC should be offered PGT; the belief that PGT is acceptable for individuals at risk of HBOC; the belief that PGT information should be given to individuals at risk of HBOC; and endorsement of PGT benefits of having children without genetic variants and eliminating genetic diseases. Conversely, those who indicated that PGT was “too much like playing God” and reported that they considered PGT in the context of religion, had less interest in PGT. It is unknown whether the attitudes of FORCE members toward PGT are representative of the majority of carriers. A cross-sectional study of 1,081 carriers, 65% of whom were recruited through FORCE and the remainder by the University of Pennsylvania, revealed that a majority of carriers were in favor of offering PGT and prenatal diagnosis to carriers (59% for PGT and 55.5% for prenatal diagnosis).[ ] Of those who indicated that their families were not complete, 41% of carriers reported that their carrier status impacted their decision about future biological children. This study also revealed that 21.5% of unpartnered carriers felt more pressure to get married. The U.K. Human Fertilization and Embryology authority has approved the use of PGT for HBOC. In a sample of 102 women with a pathogenic variant, most were supportive of PGT but only 38% of the women who had completed  their families would consider it for themselves had PGT been available, and only 14% of women who were contemplating a future pregnancy would consider PGT.[ ] In a study of 77 individuals undergoing testing as part of a multicenter cohort study in Spain, 61% of respondents reported they would consider PGT. Factors associated with PGT interest were age 40 years and older  and had a prior cancer diagnosis.[ ] In France, couples who obtain authorization from a multidisciplinary prenatal diagnosis team may access PGT free of charge as a benefit of their national 
health care system. However, no carriers have been authorized to use PGT. In a national study of 490 unaffected carriers of pathogenic variants of childbearing age (women aged 18–49 y; men aged 18–69 y), 16% stated that test results had altered their ongoing plans for childbearing.[ ] Upon qualitative analysis of written comments provided by some respondents, 
the primary impact was related to accelerating the timing of pregnancy, feelings of guilt about possibly passing on the pathogenic variant to offspring, and having future children. In response to a 
hypothetical scenario in which PGT was readily available, 33% of participants reported that they would undergo PGT. Factors associated with this intention were having no future reproductive plans at the time of the survey, feeling pregnancy termination was an acceptable option in the context of identifying a pathogenic variant, and having fewer cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer in the family. When presented with questions about expectations about delivery of PGT or prenatal diagnosis  information, 85% of respondents felt it should be provided along with test results; 45% felt that it should be provided when carriers decide to have children. Respondents stated 
that they would expect this information to be delivered by cancer geneticists (92%), obstetrician/gynecologists (76%), and general practitioners (48%). A small (N = 25) qualitative study of women of reproductive age positive for a pathogenic variant who underwent genetic testing before having children evaluated how their status influenced their attitudes about reproductive genetic testing (both PGT and prenatal diagnosis) and decisions about having children.[ ] In this study, the decision to undergo testing was primarily motivated by the desire to manage one’s personal cancer risk, rather than a desire to inform future reproductive decisions. The perceived severity of HBOC influenced concerns about passing on a pathogenic variant to children and also influenced willingness to consider PGT or prenatal diagnosis. Decisions about PGT and prenatal diagnosis also varied based on the participant's  personal experiences. Most did not believe that a known pathogenic variant was a reason to terminate a pregnancy. As observed in prior studies, knowledge of reproductive options varied; however, there was a tendency among participants to view PGT as more acceptable than prenatal diagnosis with regard to termination of 
pregnancy. Decisions regarding the pros and cons of PGT versus prenatal diagnosis with termination of pregnancy were driven primarily by personal preferences and experiences, rather than by morality judgments. For example, women were deterred from PGT based on the need to undergo fertilization and to take hormones that might increase cancer risk and based on the observed 
experiences of others who underwent this procedure. One study has examined these issues among high-risk men recruited from FORCE and Craigslist (a bulletin board website) (N = 228).[ ] Similar to the previous studies of women, only 20% of men were aware of PGT before survey participation. In a multivariate analysis, those who selected the “other” option for possible benefits of PGT compared with those who selected from several predetermined options (e.g., having children without genetic variants) and those who considered PGT in the context of 
religion (as opposed to health and safety) were less likely to report that they would ever consider using PGT. The recognition that pathogenic variants are prevalent, not only in
breast/ovarian cancer families but also in some ethnic groups,[ ] has led to
considerable discussion of the ethical, psychological, and other implications of
having one’s ethnicity be a factor in determination of disease predisposition. 
Concerns that people will think everything is solely determined by genetic factors and the creation of a genetic underclass [ ]
have been voiced.  Questions about the impact on the group of being singled out
as having genetic vulnerability to breast cancer have been raised.  There is
also confusion about who gives or withholds permission for the group to be
involved in studies of their genetic identity.  These issues challenge
traditional views on informed consent as a function of individual autonomy.[ ] A growing literature on the unique factors influencing a variety of cultural subgroups suggests the importance of developing culturally specific genetic counseling and educational approaches.[ , - ] The inclusion of members within the community of interest (e.g., breast cancer survivors, advocates, and community leaders) may enhance the development of culturally tailored genetic counseling materials.[ ] One study showed that participation in any genetic counseling (culturally mediated or standard approaches) reduced perceived risk of developing breast cancer.[ ] The human implications of the ethical issues raised by the advent of genetic
testing for breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility are described in case studies,[ ] essays,[ , ] and research reports.  Issues about rights and
responsibilities in families concerning the spread of information about genetic
risk promise to be major ethical and legal dilemmas in the coming decades. Studies have shown that 62% of studied family members were aware of the family
history and that 88% of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer family members
surveyed have significant concerns about privacy and confidentiality. 
Concern about cancer in third-degree relatives, or relatives further
removed, did not differ from  concern about cancer in the FDRs or SDRs.[ ]  Only half of surveyed FDRs of women with
breast or ovarian cancer felt that written permission should be required to
disclose test results to a spouse or immediate family member. 
Attitudes toward testing varied by ethnicity, previous exposure to genetic
information, age, optimism, and information style.  Altruism is a factor
motivating genetic testing in some people.[ ]  Many
professional groups have made recommendations regarding informed
consent.[ , - ]  There is some evidence that not all practitioners are
aware of or follow these guidelines.[ ]  Research shows that many genetic testing consent forms do not fulfill recommendations by professional
groups about the 11 areas that should be addressed,[ ] and they omit highly
relevant points of information.[ ]  In a study of women with a history of breast or ovarian cancer, the interviews yielded that the women reported feeling  inadequately prepared for the ethical dilemmas they encountered when imparting genetic information to family members.[ ] These data suggest that more preparation about disclosure to family members before testing reduces the emotional burden of disseminating genetic information to family members.  Patients and health care providers would benefit from enhanced consideration of the ethical issues of warning family members about hereditary cancer risk. (Refer to the PDQ summaries and for more information about the ethics of cancer genetics and genetic testing.) There is a small but growing body of literature on the use of decision aids as an adjunct to standard genetic counseling to assist patients in making informed decisions about cancer risk management.[ - ] One study showed that the use of a decision aid consisting of  individualized value assessment and cancer risk management information after receiving positive test results was associated with fewer intrusive thoughts and lower levels of depression at the 6-month follow-up in unaffected women. Use of the decision aid did not alter cancer risk management intentions and behaviors. Slightly detrimental effects on well-being and several decision-related outcomes, however, were noted among affected women.[ ]
Another study compared responses to a tailored decision aid (including a values-clarification exercise) versus a general information pamphlet intended for women making decisions about ovarian cancer risk management.  In the short term, the women receiving the tailored decision aid showed a decrease in decisional conflict and increased knowledge compared with women receiving the pamphlet, but no differences in decisional outcomes were found between the two groups.  In addition, the decision aid did not appear to alter the participant’s baseline cancer risk management decisions.[ ] A multisite randomized trial of 150 unaffected women with pathogenic variants assessed the effect of a decision aid on breast cancer risk management decisions and psychosocial outcomes. At 6-month and 12-month follow-up, women randomly assigned to the decision aid had lower levels of cancer-related distress ( = .01 at 6 months and = .05 at 12 months) than did the control group.[ ]  Decisional conflict scores were relatively low at baseline and declined over time in both groups; the scores between the two groups were not statistically different. Several studies have examined uptake and adherence to cancer risk management options in individuals who have had genetic counseling and testing for and pathogenic variants. Outcomes vary across studies and include the following: 1) uptake/adherence to screening options (mammography, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and 2) selection of risk-reducing options (i.e., risk-reducing mastectomy [RRM] and/or risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy [RRSO]). Most studies reported outcomes by pathogenic variant carrier status. Follow-up time after  participants received their genetic test results also varied across studies, ranging from 12 months to several years. The Hereditary Breast Cancer Clinical Study Group assessed uptake of cancer risk management options in 6,223 women with a pathogenic variant.[ ] These women were  25 to 80 years old and lived in  10 different countries (including the United States). Data from this study  revealed the following: In summary, breast cancer screening with mammogram in / carriers may be suboptimal and can diminish over time.[ ] A portion of this decline is associated with an increase in breast MRI use, and a corresponding decrease in mammography  screening, in certain countries. However, the uptake of breast MRI in carriers was also suboptimal. Women were more likely to undergo RRM when testing from 2009 and onward (30.3%) when compared with those who tested prior to 2009 (26.9%; = .04).[ ] Decisions about RRM may be influenced by personal factors, such as young patient age. When compared with women aged 30 to 39 years, women aged 50 to 59 years had lower rates of RRM (statistically significant) at 2, 5, and 10 years post–genetic testing.[ ] Other factors that may influence decisions about RRM include the following:  a family history of breast cancer, psychosocial factors (such as a desire to reduce cancer-related distress), recommendation from a health care provider, cultural/health care system–related factors, intact ovaries, and a recent diagnosis of breast/ovarian cancer.[ , ] An individual’s choice to have RRM also appears to be influenced by pretreatment genetic education and counseling, regardless of the patient's genetic test results.[ ] Additionally, when those diagnosed with breast cancer had genetic test results at the time of surgical decision-making, this resulted  in increased uptake of bilateral mastectomy (OR, 8.23; 95% CI, 2.55–26.59; < .001).[ ] In a prospective study, uptake of RRSO was associated with increasing age, White race, having children, and a family history of ovarian cancer.[ ] The decision to have RRSO  also varied based on pathogenic variant carrier status, with carriers of pathogenic variants (N = 226) undergoing RRSO more frequently than those with pathogenic variants (N = 188; = .01).[ ] In this study, a small proportion of women who were previously healthy developed breast cancer  and chose to have RRSO after their cancer diagnoses (N = 14/60; 23.3%). testing, when offered to women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, has been shown to influence surgical decision making in that carriers are more likely to opt for bilateral mastectomy compared with noncarriers.[ , , ] Predictors of contralateral  RRM before genetic counseling and testing included younger age at breast cancer diagnosis, more time since diagnosis, having at least one affected FDR, and not being employed full-time.  In the year after disclosure of test results, 18% of women who tested positive for a pathogenic variant and 2% of those whose test results were uninformative underwent contralateral  RRM.  Predictors of contralateral  RRM after genetic testing included younger age at breast cancer diagnosis, higher cancer-specific distress before genetic counseling, and having a positive test result.  In this study, contralateral  RRM was not associated with distress at 1 year after disclosure of genetic test results.  A retrospective chart review evaluated uptake of bilateral mastectomies in 110 women who underwent genetic testing before making surgical decisions about the treatment of newly diagnosed breast cancer.  Carriers of pathogenic variants were more likely to undergo bilateral mastectomies than were women in whom no variant was detected (83% vs. 37%; = .046).[ ]  The only predictor of contralateral RRM in women without a pathogenic variant was being married ( = .03).  Age, race, parity, disease stage and biomarkers, increased mammographic breast density, and breast MRI did not influence contralateral RRM decisions at the time of primary surgical treatment. A study conducted from 2006 to 2014 in 11 U.S. academic and community centers of 897 women, aged 40 years and younger at breast cancer diagnosis, found that rates of genetic testing have increased over time.[ ]  Within 1  year after diagnosis,  87% of the sample underwent testing.  The rate increased from 77% of newly diagnosed women tested in 2006 to 95% of women tested in 2013.  Among women who tested positive for a pathogenic variant and stated that testing affected their surgery decisions (n = 88), 86% underwent bilateral mastectomy compared with 51% of noncarriers ( < .001).  Among untested women, about one-third reported that they were not told by a health care provider that they were candidates for testing; yet, according to national guidelines, all were eligible for testing solely on the basis of their age at diagnosis. Data are now emerging regarding uptake and adherence to cancer risk management recommendations such as screening and risk-reducing interventions.  Cancer screening adherence and risk-reduction behaviors as defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines were assessed in a cross-sectional study of 214 women with a personal history (n = 134) or family history (n = 80) of breast or ovarian cancer.  Among unaffected women older than  40 years, 10% had not had a mammogram or clinical breast examination (CBE) in the previous year and 46% did not practice breast self-examination (BSE).  Among  women previously affected with breast or ovarian cancer, 21% had not had a mammogram, 32% had not had a CBE, and 39% did not practice BSE.[ ] Three hundred and twelve women who were counseled and tested for pathogenic variants between 1997 and 2005 responded to a survey regarding their perception of genetic testing for HBOC. The survey included questions on risk reduction options, including screening and risk-reducing surgeries. Two hundred and seventeen (70%) of the women had been diagnosed with breast cancer, and 86 (28%) tested positive for a pathogenic variant in either the or gene. None of the -positive women agreed that mammograms are difficult procedures because of the discomfort, while 11 (5.4%) of the -negative women did agree with this statement. Both groups ( -positive and -negative) agreed that risk-reducing surgeries provide the best means for lowering cancer risk and worry, and most patients in both groups expressed the belief that RRM is not too drastic, too scary, or too disfiguring.[ ] A prospective study from the United Kingdom examined the psychological impact of mammographic screening in 1,286 women aged 35 to 49 years who have a family history of breast cancer and were participants in a multicenter screening program.  Mammographic abnormalities that required additional evaluation were detected in 112 women. These women, however, did not show a statistically significant increase in cancer worry or negative psychological consequences as a result of these findings.  The 1,174 women who had no mammographic abnormality detected experienced a decrease in cancer worry and a decrease in negative psychological consequences compared with baseline after receipt of their results.  At 6 months, the entire cohort had experienced a decrease in measures of cancer worry and psychological consequences of breast screening.[ ] A qualitative study explored health care professionals’ views regarding the provision of information about health protective behaviors (e.g., exercise and diet).  Seven medical specialists and ten genetic counselors were interviewed during a focus group or individually. The study reported wide variation in the content and extent of information provided about health-protective behaviors and in general, participants did not consider it their role to promote such behaviors in the context of a genetic counseling session.  There was agreement, however, about the need to form consensus about provision of such information both within and across risk assessment clinics.[ ] Not all studies specify whether screening uptake rates fall within recommended guidelines for the targeted population or the specific clinical scenario, nor do they report on other variables that may influence cancer screening recommendations. For example, women who have a history of atypical ductal hyperplasia would be advised to follow screening recommendations that may differ from those of the general population. A prospective study conducted in the Netherlands found that among 26 carriers of pathogenic variants, the 14 women who chose mastectomy had higher distress both before test result disclosure and 6 and 12 months later, compared with the 12 carriers who chose surveillance and compared with 53 women negative for a pathogenic variant. Overall, however, anxiety declined in women undergoing RRM; at 1 year, their anxiety scores were closer to those of women choosing surveillance and to the scores of women negative for a pathogenic variant.[ ] Interestingly, women opting for RRM had lower pretest satisfaction with their breasts and general body image than carriers who opted for surveillance or noncarriers of pathogenic variants. Of the women who had an RRM, all but one did not regret the decision at 1 year posttest disclosure, but many had difficulties with body image, sexual interest and functioning, and self-esteem. The perception that doctors had inadequately informed them about the consequences of RRM was associated with regret.[ ] At the 5-year follow-up, women who had undergone RRM had less favorable body image and changes in sexual relationships, but also had a significant reduction in the fear of developing cancer.[ ] In a study of 78 women who underwent risk-reducing surgery (including carriers and women who were from high-risk families with no detectable pathogenic variant), cancer-specific and general distress were assessed 2 weeks before surgery and at 6 and 12 months postsurgery.[ ]  The sample included women who had RRM and RRSO alone and women who had both surgeries.  There was no observable increase in distress over the 1-year period. Mixed psychosocial outcomes were reported in a follow-up study (mean 14 years) of 609 women who received RRM at the Mayo Clinic.  Seventy percent were satisfied with RRM, 11% were neutral, and 19% were dissatisfied.  Eighteen percent believed that if they had the choice to make again, they probably or definitely would not have an RRM.  About three-quarters said their worry about cancer was diminished by surgery.  One-half reported no change in their satisfaction with body image; 16% reported improved body image after surgery.  Thirty-six percent said they were dissatisfied with their body image after RRM.  About one-quarter of the women reported adverse impact of RRM on their sexual relationships and sense of femininity, and 18% had diminished self-esteem.  Factors most strongly associated with satisfaction with RRM were postsurgical satisfaction with appearance, reduced stress, no reconstruction or lack of problems with implants, and no change or improvement in sexual relationships.  Women who cited physician advice as the primary reason for choosing RRM tended to be dissatisfied after RRM.[ ] A study of 60 healthy women who underwent RRM measured levels of satisfaction, body image, sexual functioning, intrusion and avoidance, and current psychological status at a mean of 4 years and 4 months postsurgery. Of this group, 76.7% had either a strong family history (21.7%) or carried a or pathogenic variant (55%). Overall, 97% of the women surveyed were either satisfied (17%) or extremely satisfied (80%) with their decision to have RRM, and all but one participant would recommend this procedure to other women. Most women (66.7%) reported that surgery had no impact on their sexual life, although 31.7% reported a worsening sexual life, and 76.6% reported either no change in body image or an improvement in body image, regardless of whether reconstruction was performed. Worsening self-image was reported by 23.3% of women after surgery. Women’s mean distress levels after surgery were only slightly above normal levels, although those women who continued to perceive their postsurgery breast cancer risk as high had higher mean levels of global and cancer-related distress than those who perceived their risk as low. Additionally, carriers of and pathogenic variants and women with a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer had higher mean levels of cancer-related distress than women with a limited family history.[ ] Very little is known about how the results of genetic testing affect treatment decisions at the time of cancer diagnosis.  Two studies explored genetic counseling and genetic testing at the time of breast cancer diagnosis.[ , ]  One of these studies found that genetic testing at the time of diagnosis significantly altered surgical decision making, with more pathogenic variant carriers than noncarriers opting for bilateral mastectomy.  Bilateral RRM was chosen by 48% of women with a known pathogenic variant [ ] and by 100% of women with a known pathogenic variant in a smaller series [ ] of women undergoing testing at the time of diagnosis.  Of women in whom no pathogenic variant was found, 24% also opted for bilateral RRM. Four percent of the test decliners also underwent bilateral RRM. Among carriers of pathogenic variants, predictors of bilateral RRM included whether patients reported that their physicians had recommended testing and bilateral RRM before testing, and whether they received a positive test result.[ ] Data are lacking on quality-of-life outcomes for women who undergo RRM after genetic testing that is performed at the time of diagnosis. A prospective study from the Netherlands evaluated long-term psychological outcomes of offering women with breast cancer genetic counseling and, if indicated, genetic testing at the onset of breast radiation for treatment of their primary breast cancer. Of those who were approached for counseling, some underwent genetic testing and chose to receive their result (n = 58), some were approached but did not fulfill referral criteria (n = 118), and some declined the option of counseling/testing (n = 44). Another subset of women undergoing radiation therapy was not approached for counseling (n = 182) but  was followed using the same measures. Psychological distress was measured at baseline and at 4, 11, 27, and 43 weeks after initial consultation for radiation therapy. No differences were detected in general anxiety, depression or breast cancer–specific distress across all four groups.[ ] A retrospective questionnaire study of 583 women with a personal and family history of breast cancer and who underwent contralateral RRM between 1960 and 1993 measured overall satisfaction after mastectomy and factors influencing satisfaction and dissatisfaction with this procedure.[ ] The mean time of follow-up was 10.3 years after risk-reducing surgery. Overall, 83% of all participants stated they were satisfied or very satisfied, 8% were neutral, and 9% were dissatisfied with contralateral RRM. Most women also reported favorable effects or no change in their self-esteem, level of stress, and emotional stability after surgery (88%, 83%, and 88%, respectively). Despite the high levels of overall satisfaction, 33% reported negative body image, 26% reported a reduced sense of femininity, and 23% reported a negative effect on sexual relationships. The type of surgical procedure also affected levels of satisfaction. The authors attributed this difference to the high rate of unanticipated reoperations in the group of women having subcutaneous mastectomy (43%) versus the group having simple mastectomy (15%) ( < .0001). Limitations to this study are mostly related to the time period during which participants had their surgery (i.e., availability of surgical reconstructive option).[ , ] None of these women had genetic testing for pathogenic variants in the genes. Nevertheless, this study shows that while most women in this group were satisfied with contralateral RRM, all women reported at least one adverse outcome. A retrospective survey of 137 carriers examined the psychosocial impact of preserving the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) in women with bilateral RRM.[ ] The study found that body image and sexual well-being differed significantly based on the type of RRM the women underwent. Women with NAC preservation were more satisfied with their breasts (72% vs. 61%), were more satisfied with the surgical outcome (85% vs. 74%) and had greater sexual well-being (68% vs. 52%) than women without NAC preservation. No differences in cancer-related distress, anxiety, depression, or risk perceptions were observed between the two groups. Oncological outcomes of nipple-sparing mastectomy in carriers have not been inferior to RRM without NAC preservation.[ ] (Refer to the section in and : Cancer Risks and Management for more information.) Another study compared long-term quality-of-life outcomes in 195 women after bilateral RRM performed between 1979 and 1999 versus 117 women at high risk of breast cancer opting for screening.  No statistically significant differences were detected between the groups for psychosocial outcomes. Eighty-four percent of those opting for surgery reported satisfaction with their decision.  Sixty-one percent of women from both the surgery and screening groups reported being very much or quite a bit contented with their quality of life.[ ] In a study of psychosocial outcomes associated with RRM and immediate reconstruction,  61 high-risk women (27 carriers of pathogenic variants, others with high-risk family history), 31 of whom had a prior history of breast cancer, were evaluated on average 3 to 4 years after surgery.[ ] The study utilized questions designed to elicit yes versus no responses and found that the surgery was well-tolerated with 83% of 
participants reporting that the results of their reconstructive surgery were as they expected, 90% reporting that they had received adequate preoperative information, none reporting that they regretted the surgery, and all reporting that 
they would choose the same 
route if they had to do it again. Satisfaction with the results ranged from 74% satisfied with the shape of their breasts to 89% satisfied with the appearance of the scarring. Comparison of this group to normative samples on quality-of-life indicators (Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire scores) indicated no reductions in quality of life in these women. A qualitative study examining material on the website posted by 21 high-risk women ( -positive) undergoing RRM showed that these women anticipated and received negative reactions from friends and family regarding the surgery, and that they managed disclosure in ways to maintain emotional support and self-protection for their decision. Many of the women expressed a relief from intrusive breast cancer thoughts and worry, and were satisfied with the cosmetic result of their surgery.[ ] In contrast, another study examined long-term psychosocial outcomes in 684 women who had had bilateral or contralateral RRM on average 9 years before assessment.[ ] A majority of women (59%) also had reconstructive surgery.  Interestingly, based on a Likert scale, 85% of women reported that they were satisfied or very satisfied with their decision to have an RRM. However, in qualitative interviews, many women went on to describe dissatisfaction or negative psychosocial outcomes associated with surgery. The authors coded the responses as negative when women reported still being anxious about their breast cancer risk and/or reported negative feelings about their body image, pain, and sexuality. Seventy-nine percent of the women providing negative comments and 84% of those making mixed comments (mixture of satisfaction and dissatisfaction) responded that they were either satisfied or very satisfied with their decision. Twice as many women with bilateral mastectomy made negative and mixed comments than did women with contralateral mastectomy. The areas of most concern were body image, problems with breast implants, pain after surgery, and sexuality. The authors proposed that those who had undergone contralateral procedures had already been treated for cancer, while those who had undergone bilateral procedures had not been treated previously, and this may partially account for the differences in satisfaction between the two groups. These findings suggest that women's satisfaction with RRM may be tempered by their complex reactions over time. In a qualitative study of 108 women who underwent or were considering RRM, more than half of those felt that presurgical consultation with a psychologist was advisable; nearly two-thirds thought that postsurgical consultation was also appropriate. All of the women believed that psychological consultation before surgery would facilitate decision-making.[ ] A retrospective self-administered survey of 40 women aged 35 to 74 years at time of RRSO (57.5% were younger than 50 y), who had undergone the procedure through the Ontario Ministry of Health due to a family history of ovarian cancer, found that RRSO resulted in a significant reduction in perceived ovarian cancer risk.  Fifty-seven percent identified a 
decrease in perceived risk as a benefit of RRSO (35% did not comment on RRSO benefits) and 49% reported that they would repeat RRSO to decrease cancer risk.  The overall quality-of-life scores were consistent with those published for women who are menopausal or participating in hormone studies.[ ] Quality of life in 59 women who underwent RRSO was assessed at 24 months postprocedure.[ ] Overall quality of life was similar to the general population and breast cancer survivors, with approximately 20% reporting depression. The 30% of subjects reporting vaginal dryness and dyspareunia were more likely to report dissatisfaction with the procedure. A Canadian prospective study examined the impact of RRSO on menopausal symptoms and sexual functioning before surgery and then 1 year later in a sample of 114 women with known pathogenic variants.[ ]  Satisfaction with the decision to undergo RRSO was high regardless of symptoms reported.  Those who were premenopausal at the time of surgery (n = 75) experienced a worsening of symptoms and a decline in sexual functioning.  HRT addressed vaginal dryness and dyspareunia but not declines in sexual pleasure.  HRT also resulted in fewer moderate to severe hot flashes. Additional work reported by this group found that the majority of the 127 women who had undergone RRSO 1 year previously (75 with pathogenic variants; 52 with pathogenic variants) felt that RRSO reduced their risk of both breast and ovarian cancer.[ ]  There was a wide range of risk perceptions for ovarian cancer noted in the group.  Twenty percent of carriers of and pathogenic variants thought that their risk of ovarian cancer was completely eliminated; others had an inflated perception of their ovarian cancer risk both before and after surgery.  A small group of these women were further surveyed at about 3 years postsurgery, and their risk perceptions did not change significantly during this extended time period. These findings suggest that important misperceptions about ovarian cancer risk may persist after RRSO. Additional genetic education and counseling may be warranted. A larger study assessed quality of life in women at high risk of ovarian cancer who opted for periodic gynecologic screening (GS) versus those who underwent RRSO.  Eight hundred forty-six high-risk women, 44% of whom underwent RRSO and 56% of whom chose GS, completed questionnaires evaluating quality of life, cancer-specific distress, endocrine symptoms, and sexual functioning.[ ]  Women in the RRSO group were a mean of 2.8 ±1.9 years from surgery and women in the GS group were a mean of 4.3 years from their first visit to a gynecologist for high-risk management. No statistical difference in overall quality of life was detected between the RRSO and GS groups.  When compared with the GS group, women who underwent RRSO had poorer sexual functioning and more endocrine symptoms such as vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and hot flashes.  Women who underwent RRSO experienced lower levels of breast and ovarian cancer distress and had a more favorable perception of cancer risk. Women (N = 182) at risk of HBOC  referred for genetic counseling were surveyed concerning their satisfaction with their choice of either RRSO or periodic screening (PS) (biannual pelvic examination with TVUS and CA-125 determination) to manage their ovarian cancer risk.[ ]  Overall satisfaction with both options was extremely high, but highest among those who chose RRSO over PS.  There were no other demographic or clinical factors that distinguished satisfaction level. There was higher decisional ambivalence among those who chose PS. A retrospective study assessed 98 carriers of pathogenic variants who underwent  RRSO about their preoperative counseling regarding symptoms to expect  after surgery.[ ] The mean age at RRSO was 45.5 years (range, 32–63 y). Eighty-five percent pursued RRSO after learning that they harbored a pathogenic variant, and 48.0% were premenopausal at the time of surgery. Participants reported  ‘‘frequent’’ or ‘‘very frequent’’ postsurgical symptoms of vaginal dryness (52.1%), changes in interest in sex (50.0%), sleep disturbances (46.7%), changes in sex life (43.9%), and hot flashes (42.9%). Only vaginal dryness and hot flashes were commonly addressed preoperatively. While 96% would have the surgery again, participants reported that the discussion of the impact of surgery on their sex life (59.2%), risk of coronary heart disease (57.1%), and the availability of sex counseling (57.1%) would have been helpful. A study [ ] of screening behaviors of 216 self-referred, high-risk (>10% risk of carrying a pathogenic variant) women who are members of hereditary breast cancer families found a range of screening practices.  Even the  presence of known pathogenic variants in their families was not associated with good adherence to recommended screening practices.  Sixty-nine percent of women aged 50 to 64 years and 83% of women aged 40 to 49 years had had a screening mammogram in the previous year.  Twenty percent of participants had ever had a CA-125 test and 31% had ever had a pelvic ultrasound or TVUS. Further analysis of this study population [ ] looking specifically at 107 women with informative test results found good use of breast cancer screening, though the uptake rate in younger carriers is lower. The reason for the lower uptake rate was not explored in this study.[ ] One survey of screening behaviors among women at increased risk of breast/ovarian cancer identified physician recommendations as a significant factor in adherence to screening.[ ] While motivations cited for pursuing genetic testing often include the expectation that carriers of pathogenic variants will be more compliant with breast and/or ovarian screening recommendations,[ , - ] limited data exist about whether participants in genetic testing alter their screening behaviors over time and about other variables that may influence those behaviors, such as insurance coverage and physician recommendations or attitudes.
The impact of cancer genetic counseling on screening behaviors was assessed in a U.K. study of 293 women followed for 12 months postcounseling at  four cancer genetics clinics.[ ] BSE, CBE, and mammography were significantly increased after counseling; however, gaps in adherence to recommendations were noted: 38% of women aged 35 to 49 years had not had a mammogram by 12 months postcounseling. BSE was not done by most women at the recommended time and frequency. This is a critical issue not only for women testing positive, but also for
adherence to screening for those testing negative and those who have
received or choose not to receive their results.  It is
possible that adherence actually diminishes with a decrease in the perceived
risk that may result from a negative genetic test result. In addition, while there is still some question regarding the link between
cancer-related worry and breast cancer screening behavior, accumulating
evidence appears to support a linear rather than a curvilinear relationship. 
That is, for some time, the data were not consistent; some data supported the
hypothesis that mild-to-moderate worry may increase adherence, while excessive
worry may actually decrease the utilization of recommended screening practices. 
Other reports support the notion that a linear relationship is more likely;
that is, more worry increases adherence to screening recommendations.  Few
studies, however,  have followed women to assess their health behaviors
after genetic testing.  Thus, a negative test result leading to decreased
worry could theoretically result in decreased screening adherence.  A large study found that patient compliance with screening practices was not related to general or screening-specific anxiety—with the exception of BSE, for which compliance is negatively associated with procedure-specific anxiety.[ ] Further
research designed to clarify this potential concern would highlight the need
for comprehensive genetic counseling to discuss the need for follow-up
screening. Further complicating this area of research are issues such as the baseline rate
of mammography adherence among women older than 40 or 50 years before genetic
testing.  More specifically, the ability to note a significant difference in
adherence on this measure may be affected by the high adherence rate to this
screening behavior before genetic testing by women undergoing such testing.   It
may be easier to find significant changes in mammography use among women with a
family history of breast cancer who test positive.  Finally, adherence over
time will likely be affected by how women undergoing genetic
testing and their caregivers perceive the efficacy of many of the screening options
in question, such as mammography for younger women, BSE,
and ovarian cancer screening (periodic vaginal ultrasound and serum CA-125
measurements), along with the value of preventive interventions. The issue of screening decision-making and adherence among women undergoing
genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer is the subject of several ongoing
trials, and an area of much needed ongoing study. The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as new information becomes available.

txt: Sometimes, as the disease , changes take place in the person with cancer. These may be due to the side effects of treatment or the cancer itself. Or they may be caused by other drugs. Some caregivers have said that they wished they had known sooner about what changes to expect. Changes may occur in: The person you're caring for may or may not go through any of these changes. But you should ask the doctor whether you need to be aware of them and what you can do about them if they happen. No one told us what these pills would do. My partner started to have mood swings and get really angry at me for no reason. Her nurse told me later that this was common when taking these drugs, but how was I supposed to know that? Ashley After deciding on , sometimes questions arise about whether the person with advanced cancer should live at home or be moved to a nursing or assisted living facility. When making these decisions, here are a few good questions to ask: You’ll also need to consider how your loved one feels. They may fear: Sometimes it's easier to consider a change in living arrangements when the advice comes from a health professional. Social workers, including visiting nurses, those who work with older adults, and others may be able to help you talk to your loved one about these decisions. What do you say to someone with ? Whether it’s a spouse, family member, or friend, talking about serious issues is never easy. It’s normal to not know what to say to someone with end-stage cancer, or to worry that you’ll say the wrong thing. But the most important thing is not what you say, but that you're showing you care. This section offers advice on how to talk about terminal cancer. Your loved one with cancer may want to go to our patient section, , for tips as well. It’s likely that you and your loved one with cancer are both having the same thoughts and fears about the end of life. There will come a time when you will need to talk about these issues together. These might include: Some families talk openly about these sorts of things, while others don’t. There's no right or wrong way to connect. But studies show that families who talk things out feel better about the care they get and the decisions they make. A few things to remember are: Bringing up issues related to terminal cancer can be tough. You may think, for example, that your loved one needs to try a different treatment or see a different doctor. Or they may be worried about losing independence, being seen as weak, or being a burden to you. What's important to remember is that your loved one has the right to choose how to live the rest of their life. Although you may have strong opinions about what they should do, the decision is theirs to make. Below are some tips on how to bring up hard topics. Some people won’t start a conversation themselves, but may respond if you start first. But if you have trouble talking about painful issues, ask for professional advice. A counselor or other mental health expert may be able to help you and your loved one explore topics that you don’t feel able to on your own. And if they don't want to go to the counselor with you, you can always go alone. You may hear some ideas for how to bring up these topics. You can also talk about other concerns and feelings that you're dealing with right now. Dad, you are going to be just fine. Dad, are there some things that worry you? Don’t talk like that! You can beat this! It must be hard to come to terms with all of this. I can’t see how anyone can help anymore. We will be there for you always. What do the doctors know? You might live forever. Do you think the doctors are right? How does it seem to you? Please don’t give up. I need you here. I will miss you terribly. But we will get through somehow. There has to be something more to try. Let’s be sure to get the best of medical treatments, but we will be together when we have done all we can. Don’t be glum. You’ll get well. It must be hard. Can I just sit with you for a while? From J. Lynn, J. Harrold, and J.L. Schuster Oxford University Press: New York, NY. 2011. Reprinted with permission. A terminal cancer diagnosis brings up a number of decisions to make. These may be about what type of care or treatment to receive. Or they may be about the kind of information patients and loved ones want to hear. Or deciding where to continue getting care. Yet in some families and also in some cultures, it's common for family caregivers to make most of the decisions. And they may make them with or without the patient knowing. Or, sometimes the patient wants the caregiver to make all the decisions. Making these decisions may be hard on you for a number of reasons including: . However, in the end, it's their choice. If you can't agree, you may want to ask someone else to guide the conversation between you both. You might talk to a member of your faith community, a social worker, other people dealing with cancer, or a hospice worker. . It's important to get a sense of how they feel about certain issues while they can still tell you. For example, who would they like to be in charge of their medical decisions? Have they signed to express what kind of care they want to receive? . For example, you may want to keep them alive, whatever it takes. But they may wish to stop receiving life-sustaining measures at a certain point. Try to keep things in perspective by looking at how the disease has advanced. Listen to the doctors and others who are giving care. Get the facts about the care you wish your loved one would get versus what is being given. . Think about what they would want, or imagine what they would say if they could talk. Try to remember if something was said in the past that would help you decide. . If this is the case for you, ask a member of your health care team to hold a family meeting and lead a discussion. They can explain the goals of the medical care being offered. For example, are they to: Talking about these issues can help answer remaining questions. Having this talk with everyone present may lessen the conflicts and help the family reach a decision for your loved one. Children of all ages may wonder about dying, life after death, and what happens to the body. It's important to answer all their questions. If not, they may imagine things or make up their own stories. Let them know that everything is being done to keep their loved one comfortable. Tell them that you will keep them updated. (For much more detailed advice on .) . Children deserve to be told the truth about a poor prognosis. Hiding the truth from them leaves them unprepared for their loved one's death and can prolong the grief they will feel. And if you don't talk about your loved one's condition or don't tell the truth about it, your children may have a hard time trusting others in the future. By including children in the family crisis, you can guide them toward healthy ways of coping with what is happening. You can help them prepare for their impending loss in healing ways, such as providing opportunities for them to say goodbye. . To answer tough questions from your kids about the potential death of your loved one, you need to know your own views on the subjects, including: You can show children how to hope for the best while accepting the likely outcome of death. If you're honest and up front, you're teaching them that death is a natural part of life. Your honesty shows them it’s okay to talk about death. You can also tell them that they won't be alone in their time of need. You will always be there for them. Counselors and oncology social workers can also suggest ways to talk to kids about death in ways they understand. They may know of local or national programs that offer help to children in these situations. Or they may suggest books, videos, and websites that explore these topics. If your children don't live with the person who has terminal cancer, it's helpful to prepare them before they visit. The decision of whether or not to let them visit is up to you, the person with cancer, and perhaps other family members. However, children should also have a choice about whether or not they want to visit. If your loved one is in a hospital or other facility, explain what the area and the room will look like. Tell them who might be there and what they might see. Also explain gently if their loved one’s physical condition or personality has changed. For a younger child, you might say something like this: Sometimes children don't want to visit, or can't for other reasons. In that case, there are other ways of showing they care. They can write a letter or do artwork. They can call the patient or leave messages or songs in their voicemail. Encourage them to show love and support in any way they choose.
